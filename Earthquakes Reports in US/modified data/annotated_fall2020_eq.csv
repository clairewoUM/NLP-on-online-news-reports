6,2.2 magnitude earthquake reported near Sparta,2020-09-23 14:34 UTC,https://myfox8.com/news/2-2-magnitude-earthquake-reported-near-sparta/,0,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. ?€? Sparta felt another earthquake more than a month after an earthquake led to hundreds of cases of damage in the town.   The damage left behind after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck Sparta on Aug. 9 was worse than initially thought, according to the Town of Sparta.  ?€?We are hearing continuous rumbles throughout our community here in town and in Alleghany County, but we thank the Good Lord to this day that there have been no injuries or fatalities,?€? Mayor Wes Brinegar said during a Tuesday news conference. While damage assessments are still ongoing, the Town of Sparta had received about 525 reports of damage as of the close of business Monday, Emergency Management Director Daniel Shoffner said. 60 of these cases have been categorized as ?€?major damage,?€? meaning they lost 40% or more in value. ?€?We underestimated the damage and that was the number one thing. We were looking for major damage in our initial reports, but now, it?€?s coming out more and more with damage more widespread and severe,?€? Brinegar said. Brinegar said many of the people living in Sparta, especially those in the older population, are dealing with the emotional trauma that comes with having a natural disaster. And having 20 aftershocks since the earthquake hasn?€?t helped. ?€?We?€?re still getting those aftershocks and those loud booms periodically. A lot of people are on edge right now and a lot of people have those issues because they?€?re paranoid right now,?€? Brinegar said. The Estep sisters didn?€?t return back to even look at the damage until Tuesday ?€? more than a week after the quake. They own three side-by-side properties that have all been deemed unlivable. ?€?Our parents were here first and all total 54 years,?€? Mary Estep said. In those 54 years, a lot of memories have been made there. ?€?All the Christmas?€? all the holidays, birthday, Thanksgiving was here,?€? Mary Estep said. In a matter of seconds, everything changed. ?€?All of a sudden it was like a bomb went off. Everything was flying and shaking, and it was terrifying. Only thing I was thinking was, ?€?I got to get her out of the kitchen,?€??€? Mary Estep said. As the quake shook photos, books and home d??cor off the walls and shelves, she was in the living room frantically trying to get to her sister Alice Estep. ?€?She was yelling ?€?get out, get out.?€? And I was saying ?€?I?€?m right here, I?€?m right here,?€??€? Alice Estep said. Hanging on to one another, the two women made it to the door only to find that it was blocked from the outside. A neighbor was able to get them out. They own these two homes and the apartments in the middle. All three properties are beyond repair. ?€?This is a loss completely to us. We just don?€?t know where to turn, or what to do,?€? Alice Estep said. While it?€?s going to take months for some people, cleanup efforts have begun for those who?€?ve documented their damages. The emergency management report for damage assessment has been sent to state officials. ?€?We are very much relying on state and federal officials to help put the people in this county,?€? said Daniel Roten, Alleghany County Emergency Management coordinator. He?€?s hopeful the county will get some money to assist individuals in this time of need. ?€?As its been mentioned before, no one here had earthquake insurance ?€? maybe a handful. I can count them on one hand,?€? Roten said. Unfortunately, with every tragedy, Brinegar said it seems like there?€?s someone trying to profit off of it. He said scammers are creating GoFundMe pages asking people to donate. The Red Cross is now housing 19 people from 10 families. The city doesn?€?t have an official GoFundMe for the victims. Brinegar said all assistance will go through the American Red Cross and they do have a fund called ?€?Sparta Alleghany County North Carolina Earthquake.?€? Shoffner says the school system did sustain some damage during the earthquake. The school system has taken the necessary steps to ensure the safety of students and faculty.  The area felt eight tremors before the earthquake, as well as 20 aftershocks. The 5.1 earthquake centered in Sparta was felt across North Carolina.  Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. The 5.1 magnitude earthquake in Sparta was the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916.

21,"Earthquake on Sunday brought 'much excitement, but little impact' to Rhode Island",2020-11-10 02:00 UTC,https://www.thewesterlysun.com/news/westerly/earthquake-on-sunday-brought-much-excitement-but-little-impact-to-rhode-island/article_89fb00c4-22ce-11eb-bd80-037d0e96e48a.html,1," Rain showers early will evolve into a more steady rain overnight. Low 51F. Winds ESE at 10 to 20 mph. Chance of rain 90%. Rainfall near an inch.    This ShakeMap, issued by the United States Geological Survey, shows the intensity and extent of Sunday?€?s earthquake throughout southern New England. Generated by the USGS regional seismic network, the ShakeMap provides real time maps of ground-shaking and earthquake intensity.?? Residents of southern New England were surprised Sunday morning by rumbling and shaking caused by an earthquake on the north shore of Buzzard?€?s Bay, about 30 miles east of Providence.??  John Geiger, a geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey?€?s National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colorado, said the earthquake occurred on the Massachusetts coast, about 6.2 miles below the surface. Too small to cause any significant damage but powerful enough to shake homes and rattle windows, the quake was first classified as a magnitude 4, but was later downgraded to a 3.6. Geiger explained that 3.6 was the average magnitude recorded by seismometers. ?€?Basically, we?€?ll look and see and sometimes, it?€?s hundreds of stations and we?€?ll pick where the onset is for the quake for each of those individual stations and each one has its own magnitude and it?€?s calculated by the different types of [seismic] waves that it sees,?€? he said. ?€?Sometimes, a particular station may have a much higher magnitude than another station and those are outliers.?€? As soon Sunday?€?s quake subsided, the calls started coming in to local police and other emergency responders. ?€?I couldn?€?t tell you how many, but we received numerous calls right after, wondering what was going on, what happened, what was the shaking,?€? Westerly Police Chief Shawn Lacey said. ?€?We were probably alerted within two minutes of the earthquake, through our database, that there was actually an earthquake.?€? ?€?The general public was calling into police dispatch,?€? Charlestown EMA Director Kevin Gallup said. ?€?I called down there and they said the phones were blowing up ?€? It was pretty much a much a high excitement, low impact event.?€? In Hopkinton, EMA Director Ron MacDonald III was in church when the quake began. ?€?I heard about 10 to 15 seconds of rumbling,?€? he said. ?€?I thought it was a military plane or something going overhead. When I was just leaving church, I was getting text messages from all the local emergency managers saying that they thought it was an earthquake. I put out a social media message to my Facebook page explaining what it was.?€? In Richmond, EMA Director Joseph Arsenault urged residents to make sure there had been no damage to their homes. ?€?The most important thing people want to do it they want to make sure that their house is stable,?€? he said. ?€?If the house seems to be compromised, make sure you don?€?t have electricity going. You want to make sure the gas is shut off.?€? The experience brought back bad memories for Arsenault?€?s daughter, Kayleigh Hill, who had returned to Rhode Island after living in Anchorage, Alaska, where powerful earthquakes are more common. In Nov. 2018, Hill found herself trying to drive to work during a 7.2 magnitude earthquake, as the road crumbled around her car. Sunday's quake, she said, reminded her of the aftershocks that followed the one in Anchorage. ?€?There were thousands of aftershocks after that 7.2 earthquake, so as soon as you feel it or hear it, you know what it is and you?€?re like, ?€?oh no, another one,?€??€? she said. ""So it?€?s just kind of like an automatic reaction. As soon as I heard the rumble and the house creaking I was like ?€?oh, this is an earthquake. Why are we having an earthquake here? This is Rhode Island.?€??€? The epicenter of the quake was on the North American plate, one of many plates, or rock slabs, that cover the planet. Plate tectonics refers to the movements of those plates along cracks known as faults, and it is those movements that produce earthquakes. There is no documented fault where Sunday?€?s earthquake occurred, but Geiger said it is likely that an ancient fault exists. ?€?I was looking at it on our map, and I don?€?t see any fault map,?€? he said. ?€?That doesn?€?t mean there?€?s not a fault there, because if there was an earthquake, then by definition, it was on a fault.?? But we don?€?t have any detailed information on the faults over there.?€? Compared to states like California and Alaska, southern New England is not a seismically-active region, but powerful earthquakes have been recorded here for centuries. A 6.5 magnitude earthquake, probably originating in New Hampshire, occurred in 1638, just 18 years after the Pilgrims had landed at Plymouth Rock.??  ?€?It came with a rumbling noise or low murmur, like unto remote thunder,?€? he wrote. ?€?It came from the northward and passed southward; as the noise approached nearer, the earth began to shake and came at length with that violence as caused platters, dishes and suchlike things as stood upon shelves, to clatter and fall down. Yea, persons were afraid of the houses themselves.?€? More big earthquakes followed, a 5.6 in 1727, a 6.5 in 1755, a 5.2 in 1884 and a 5.9 in 1904. Several notable earthquakes have been recorded in the 20th and 21st centuries. Earth is a dynamic planet, Geiger said, and as tectonic plates shift, no matter where they are, sometimes they produce earthquakes. ?€?There are a lot of stresses underneath the surface of the earth and sometimes, that stress is released in the form of earthquakes,?€? he said. cdrummond@thewesterlysun.com @cynthiadrummon4      Keep it Clean.

SAN FRANCISCO  (KGO) -- ABC7 News Anchor Cheryl Jennings looks back at the dramatic early hours of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake as both residents and reporters were just beginning to realize the magnitude of what had happened.  Jennings was at a makeshift anchor desk in a badly damaged newsroom as the chilling scenes of disaster began to appear. The earthquake hit Northern California on Oct. 17, 1989, killing 63 people and causing billions of dollars in damage.  It struck just after 5 pm, right as a World Series game between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics was about to start. The shaking lasted for 15 seconds.  When it was over many parts of the Bay Area had lost power and phone service.  Most TV and radio stations were knocked off the air, but ABC7 was uniquely positioned to get the story to the Bay Area and the rest of the world.  Just a few minutes after the earthquake hit, ABC7 used its emergency generator to become the first television station back on the air. The ABC network was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park in San Francisco and had a blimp overhead.  So the blimp was sent to get the first live video of a huge fire that was engulfing the city's Marina District. ABC7's helicopter got dramatic early shots of collapsed sections of the Cypress Freeway in Oakland and the Bay Bridge.  ABC News reporter Leslie Brinkley and photographer John Griffin had just crossed the bridge on the way to another story when the quake hit.  They were the only television crew able to get on the bridge to capture the dramatic rescue of people trapped in cars dangling over the edge of the collapsed section. Throughout the disaster, the station broadcasted continuous information about avoiding dangers with gas and electrical lines, how to survive aftershocks, and, in what proved to be surprisingly valuable advice, how to find emergency information in the telephone book. The station became a clearinghouse for information as a service to other news providers and area residents. ABC7 also helped the relief effort, doing major fundraising for the Red Cross and Salvation Army, and distributing survival information. For outstanding service to its community during a time of crisis, ABC7 received the prestigious Peabody Award. Take a look at ABC7's in-depth coverage of the Loma Prieta earthquake here.

25,Google Builds Largest Earthquake Detection System With Your Phone,2020-09-25 04:00 UTC,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2020/09/25/google-builds-largest-earthquake-detection-system-with-your-phone/,0,"If you carry around an Android smartphone, did you know it can be part of the world's largest earthquake detection system? Thanks to a collaboration between Google, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES), the concept is being vetted as a cost-effective alternative to creating a public infrastructure to detect and alert the public to an earthquake in their area. Google Builds Largest Earthquake Detection System With Your Phone Why an Android Phone-Powered Earthquake Alert System? Earthquakes are a daily occurrence around the world. The earlier the millions of people who live in an earthquake-prone region get notified of a quake (before things begin to shake) so they can drop and take cover, the safer they will be. However, traditional earthquake alert systems are costly to build and deploy. Since all smartphones have little accelerometers in them?€?a device that detects rotation?€?Google thought that we might be walking around with a solution to an earthquake detection system. Turns out their hunch was right on target, and smartphones can expand their influence to become life-saving emergency notification devices. Tested by Android Device Owners in California Google and collaborators first deployed the Android platform as an earthquake alert system in California. By working with the USGS and Cal OES, Google used the ShakeAlert system to send earthquake alerts. The ShakeAlert system was developed by the country?€?s leading seismologists. It receives signals from more than 700 seismometers located across the state. While California was able to have this infrastructure in place, many other earthquake-prone areas in the world are not. But the large Android network around the world with millions of smartphones acting as individual seismometers could fill in the gap. If an individual phone's accelerometer detects something it thinks could be an earthquake, it sends the signal to Google servers. Then, algorithms go to work, combining that data with info from other smartphones to figure out if an earthquake is actually happening. For this to be effective, the system is racing the speed of light (essentially the speed of phone data) against the speed of an earthquake. If an earthquake is detected, the system will be able to share accurate information about the extent of the earthquake quickly to those who might face danger because of it. Google is currently testing the system and cautiously rolling out future phases as it builds confidence in the system?€?s reliability. Eventually, the plans are to deploy it in areas that don?€?t have traditional seismic-monitoring systems. Android Phones Can Detect Both Types of Earthquake Waves There are two different types of earthquake waves, and the Android phones can detect both. The primary wave or P wave is the fastest and first wave sent out when there's an earthquake. It's followed by a secondary wave or S wave that might be slower but usually bigger and causes more destruction to more people. If the Android system can give early warnings out when the P wave is detected, it could help minimize the damage when the S wave comes through. As anonymized data starts coming to Google's servers, Bayesian filters and other machine learning algorithms get to work to determine if what the phones are reporting is an actual seismic event. If so, warning alerts go out. Phones nearest to the quake?€?s epicenter will have less warning than those further afield; however, they can play a critical role in helping safeguard those that will experience the larger secondary wave. Google works with seismologists to figure out the appropriate alerts for different levels of earthquakes. When time is of the essence, the alerts must convey critical information concisely. Once Google has refined its earthquake alert system, it does plan to release an API. This paves the way for developers to take the framework built by Google and create solutions for a lot of important use cases that could make living with quakes easier. Imagine if there were systems built to shut off gas valves, transportation management systems such as traffic lights could be manipulated to keep people away from danger and more through future development. For now, Google is focused on refining its system to reduce the number of false positives. Google is including this capability as part of Google Mobile Services, which makes it accessible for most Android phones used today.

By working with the USGS and Cal OES, Google used the ShakeAlert system to send earthquake alerts.
If an individual phone's accelerometer detects something it thinks could be an earthquake, it sends the signal to Google servers.
Google works with seismologists to figure out the appropriate alerts for different levels of earthquakes.",California,38.2969,-76.4949

EAST FREEHOLD, N.J. (WPVI) -- No injuries or major damage have been reported from a 3.1 magnitude earthquake felt in Freehold, New Jersey on Wednesday morning. But the tremors were enough to wake people in the middle of the night, flooding the Monmouth County 911 Center with calls. In surveillance video outside the center, you can just barely see the camera shake during the quake, which began around 2 a.m., but people near the epicenter definitely felt it. ""My husband thought it was a gas main explosion or something like that,"" said Jennifer Gerstenberg of Freehold.  ""When I woke up, my friend called me and said that she felt an earthquake and stuff fell off of her shelf,"" said sixth-grade Sarah Gerstenberg. ""Our operators actually in our 911 center located just across the way has experienced what they describe as a jet engine kind of explosion,"" said Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden. Within 30 minutes of the 3.1 magnitude earthquake, the Monmouth County 911 Center received around 125 calls.  ""I heard something,"" said one worried caller. ""Like your house shook? Yeah. So did half the state I guess,"" answered the dispatcher.  Some were asking if an explosion had happened.  ""Our whole building just shook. And a big boom happened,"" one caller said. ""Just get yourself into a safe place, OK? We're not sure what it was, but we do have officers out investigating the area, OK?"" the dispatcher replied. Researchers at Princeton University are spent the day looking at data collected from campus, 30 miles from the epicenter.  ""This is just part of the normal process of the earth's cycle of plate tectonics. The slow building up stress and a sudden release of elastic energy,"" said Frederik Simons, professor of seismology at Princeton University. He said these small earthquakes are normal, we just don't feel them very often. ""Feeling one in New Jersey is extremely rare,"" said Simons. Professor Simons estimated this earthquake could be felt within a radius of 30-50 miles from Freehold. The earthquake, although small, is also relatively uncommon in the region. A 2.7 earthquake was reported in Bernardsville, New Jersey in 2015. The Greater Delaware Valley region felt tremors after a 4.1 magnitude quake struck near Dover, Delaware back in December 2017. And on Aug 23, 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake in central Virginia shook buildings in the tri-state area.

The rumble with a 3.6 magnitude was centered on Buzzards Bay, southwest of Bliss Corner in Dartmouth, the USGS said, and struck at a depth of a little more than 15 kilometers (9.3 miles). Initially, the USGS report indicated the magnitude of the earthquake may have been as high as 4.2. That was later revised downward to 4.0, and then again to 3.6.  Residents of southern New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut have also reported feeling the earthquake. The Red Cross of Massachusetts told WCVB that three New Bedford homes in the area of Crapo and Nelson streets had to be evacuated due to structural damage caused by the earthquake. As a result, 10 families totaling 22 people have been displaced.

USGS has revised it to a magnitude 4.0,?€? Campagna tweeted. Earlier reports indicated that the earthquake was slightly stronger at 4.2.  ?€? WCVB-TV Boston (@WCVB) November 8, 2020  Several social media users have taken to Facebook and Twitter to ask if others had felt their homes shake, wondering whether or not what they felt was indeed an earthquake. Many compared the sensation to a large truck driving by outside, while others felt the shaking was more intense and instantly knew it was an earthquake. ?€?I felt it too in the Hartford area of [Connecticut]. I woke up to it thinking it was my lil brother rocking my bed,?€? one Twitter user wrote. ?€?Felt in Warwick, [Rhode Island], for several seconds. More than I?€?ve ever felt here before,?€? added another. Warwich is located about 42.1 miles from Bliss Corner. ?€?Here in New Bedford it was bad.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Massachusetts has recorded more than 400 known earthquakes that were felt by residents since 1668. The largest in history was the Cape Ann earthquake in 1775. That quake was between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale and caused damage to hundreds of buildings in the city of Boston. Prior to this morning?€?s earthquake, the most recent was recorded in Western Massachusetts back in November 2012, with a magnitude of 1.9.

Several buildings were wrecked in Turkey's western Izmir province, according to officials. ISTANBUL -- A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 14 people and injuring over 500 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 12 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, including one who drowned, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said 522 people were injured, with five undergoing surgery and eight in intensive care.  On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying ""Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children."" At least 19 people were injured in Samos, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul's governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey's largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion.

A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 12 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, including one who drowned, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said 522 people were injured, with five undergoing surgery and eight in intensive care.  On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying ""Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children."" At least 19 people were injured in Samos, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul's governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey's largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter - roughly 10 kilometers - potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 2,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens. France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France's ""full solidarity with Greece and Turkey"" and said ""we are ready to offer the necessary aid."" The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. ""We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,"" Turkey's Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. ""This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We're ready to help if Greece needs it."" Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, tweeted that he had phoned Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ""to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries.

""Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,"" he wrote. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights.

         VALLEY VILLAGE (CBSLA) -- Since the magnitude 4.5 earthquake that shook Angelenos out of bed on Friday night, several smaller quakes have hit this week ?€? including a magnitude 3.2 near Rancho Cucamonga and a 3.3 near Lake Elsinore. ""[There's] a bit of anxiety around when is the next one going to happen,"" said Valley Village resident Rachel Aune. Aune said she's still rattled after the series of quakes. ""We've been in California for the past 10 years, and we haven't felt any like we have in the past year,"" she said. ""So that is concerning."" Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said that this series of quakes is normal for Southern California, and the area averages about 10 magnitude 4 or above earthquakes every year. Magnitude 3 earthquakes occur, on average, every week. ""The earthquake is inevitable but the disaster is not,"" Jones said. ""When you put it in Los Angeles, in the basin, this one was in the San Gabriel Valley, many more people feel it."" The active seismic week has left many on edge, wondering what might be ahead. Dr. Jones said that a cluster of small quakes does not necessarily mean the area is free from a big one. ""You can never get enough small ones to replace the big one...since that ratio is constant,"" she said. ""You need a big one to keep the ratio constant, and it's the most consistent thing we record about earthquakes all over the world is this ratio of large to small. Places that have small earthquakes have lots of big ones."" Glenn Pomeroy ?€? the CEO of the California Earthquake Authority, a nonprofit earthquake insurance company ?€? said these tremors are always a good reminder for people to have an earthquake plan, especially as people are spending more time at home due to the pandemic. ""Whenever there is an earthquake, our website traffic increases,"" he said. ""Our policy sales skyrocketed after the Ridgecrest earthquake. There is more that we can do. Most people don't have earthquake insurance. they have to know it's not covered in their homeowners policy and federal assistance will be limited, and they ought to give it some thought whether its through us or someone else."" This is earthquake country, after all, Dr. Jones said. And the best way to combat fear is to be prepared. ""You shouldn't be more scared of having an earthquake now because we had that 4.5 last week, but you shouldn't be less scared,"" she said. ""Remember that the earthquakes are part of Southern California, and they don't have to be a disaster. You can prevent most of the damage... but you need to educate yourself."" The state's largest earthquake preparedness drill, The Great Shakeout, is on Oct. 5. This normally happens in schools and offices across the state, but due to COVID-19 many will be participating from home.   ??2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Watch CBS News

         SOUTH EL MONTE (CBSLA) -- A 4.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Los Angeles area late Friday night, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.  The focal point of the earthquake was almost the same location as the M5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquake in 1987, according to seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones. There have been reports that the quake was felt in La Habra, Long Beach, Oxnard, Ontario, Pasadena, near the Beverly Hills area, and other regions throughout L.A. County. Some residents said they felt jolts from about three seconds to possibly up to a minute long. All 106 fire stations in the city of Los Angeles activated, each checking their areas for damage, according to Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph M. Terrazas.   This is one of the largest earthquakes in the Los Angeles Basin in a few years. Jones said that 5% of the time, an initial earthquake may actually be a foreshock that is preceding a larger earthquake. There is also an approximately 50% chance that an aftershock around 3.0 magnitude strength could be felt, according to Jones. There were no reports of extensive damages or injuries in the city of L.A. on Friday night, Chief Terrazas said.  The Los Angeles Police Department also said there were ""no significant incidents to report"" related to the earthquake, but urged residents to have plans in place should aftershocks occur. Per our Department Operations Center, fortunately there are no significant incidents to report related to the 4.6 magnitude earthquake. Be prepared for potential aftershocks & only use 911 for emergencies. You can use 877-ASK-LAPD for non-emergencies in the City of Los Angeles. Call 911 for emergencies or dial 877-275-5273 (877-ASK-LAPD) for non-emergencies in the City of Los Angeles.

The 2 a.m. temblor was felt ""in much of central New Jersey,"" according to the National Weather Service. It lasted about 13 seconds. Shaking and loud bangs were reported, but no injuries.  Social media, mostly from central New Jersey residents, alternately reported they thought a truck hit their house, or a low flying plane, or even a sonic boom. The epicenter was near the Monmouth County Sheriff's Public Safety Complex on Kozloski Road in Freehold, Sheriff Shaun Golden told us. He said there was no damage to the operation center. Law enforcement will conduct a canvas during daylight hours to see if there is any damage, although nothing more is expected than belongings knocked off shelves. The sheriff's office received about 125 calls to 911 in about 30 minutes. The earthquake, although small, is also relatively uncommon in the region.

         BOSTON (CBS) ?€? Sunday's earthquake that shook much of southern New England didn't cause significant damage. But it was still a rare occurrence for the region. Homes from Cape Cod all the way to Long Island felt the magnitude 3.6 earthquake that originated in Buzzard's Bay. WBZ-TV meteorologist Zack Green said that while it's not uncommon for an earthquake to rumble in New England, this was the first one of this magnitude since the 1970s. Several dozen residents in New Bedford reported minor damage to their homes, most in basements where chimneys cracked. New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell said residents should check their chimneys and basement and report any damage to the fire department. ""First of all it's crazy that we had an earthquake. It's not what you'd expect. We expect other natural disasters to occur from time to time but earthquakes are not one of them,"" Mitchell said, adding there have been previous instances along the same fault line in Buzzard's Bay.

         BOSTON (CBS/AP) ?€? The strongest earthquake to hit southern New England in decades rattled homes and nerves Sunday morning, but didn't cause any significant damage, authorities said. The 3.6 magnitude earthquake centered off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts, in Buzzards Bay struck just after 9 a.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. The earthquake hit at a depth of a little more than 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) and was felt across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and into Connecticut and Long Island, New York. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a magnitude 3.5 temblor hit in March 1976, said Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist. About 14,000 people went to the agency's website to report the earthquake, including people from Easthampton, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut, both about 100 miles (160 kilometers) away, and several from more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) away in Boston, he said. That's not unusual in New England. ""It's common for them to be felt very far away because the rock here is old and continuous and transmits the energy a long way,"" Caruso said. Ali Kenner Brodsky, who lives in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, not far from the epicenter, was sitting in her kitchen talking with her son, when it hit. ""It was a rumbling. It sounded like something exploded. It rumbled. The whole house shook,"" she said. She said it lasted around 10 to 15 seconds. ""In that moment, it feels like it's going on forever."" Her husband, Sam, ran to the basement because he thought the boiler blew up. Sarah Trainor was lying in bed in Plymouth at the time. She was immediately concerned about her furnace. ""It was probably about less than 10 seconds, pretty short,"" she said. ""I think it felt longer because mentally you're like 'what is happening right now."" ?? Magnitude 3.6 earthquakes rarely cause major damage, Caruso said. Chris Besse, a spokesman for the oMassachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said it had not received any reports of significant damage. There were some reports of minor damage. New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell reported that the earthquake caused damage to at least two homes in the city's South End. The fire department is inspecting basements and the Red Cross is helping impacted residents. The quake appears to have caused damage like this to at least two houses in the South End.

Police in Fall River tweeted that they received numerous phone calls about the quake, including reports of items falling off of shelves, and street signs getting uprooted. (??

Several buildings were wrecked in Turkey's western Izmir province, according to officials. ISTANBUL -- A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 14 people and injuring over 500 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 12 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, including one who drowned, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said 522 people were injured, with five undergoing surgery and eight in intensive care.  On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying ""Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children."" At least 19 people were injured in Samos, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul's governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey's largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter - roughly 10 kilometers - potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 2,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens. France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France's ""full solidarity with Greece and Turkey"" and said ""we are ready to offer the necessary aid."" The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. ""We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,"" Turkey's Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. ""This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We're ready to help if Greece needs it."" Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, tweeted that he had phoned Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ""to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together."" Erdogan responded to the tweet with his thanks and offered his condolences. ""Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,"" he wrote. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights.

A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 19 people and injuring over 700 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 17 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey?€?s third-largest city, including one who drowned, and 709 were injured, according to Turkey?€?s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Among the dead were the wife and two children of the secretary-general of the Turkish Medical Association?€?s Izmir branch, the group said. On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying ?€?Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children.?€? At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall and cranes lifted concrete slabs from the wreckage.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul?€?s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey?€?s largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter ?€? roughly 10 kilometers ?€? potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 3,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens.

Dr. John Ebel, a research scientist at Weston Observatory, said the earthquake was felt as far up as southern New Hampshire and as far west as Hartford, Connecticut. The New Bedford Fire Department is advised anyone who felt the earthquake to check their gas lines, furnace and smokestack for potential damage and make sure they have a working carbon monoxide detector. If there?€?s no apparent damage, Vice President of Home and Commercial services with GEM Plumbing Joseph Andrade said homeowners should conduct a visual inspection to make sure nothing has shifted or moved out of place. ?€?Any of the gas piping, or anything to do with the piping of the household, check to make sure nothing has broken and there?€?s nothing leaking,?€? Andrade said. Andrade said homeowners that smell a gas-like odor should vacate immediately and call 911. ?€?I would call the authorities to shut it down and basically have a licensed professional go in and take a look at it and make the repairs,?€? he said. 12 News has learned National Grid inspected its??gas and electric systems across Rhode Island and Massachusetts soon after Sunday?€?s earthquake.

Low 51F. Winds ESE at 10 to 20 mph. Chance of rain 90%. Rainfall near an inch.   BOSTON ?€? The strongest earthquake to hit southern New England in decades rattled homes and nerves Sunday morning, but didn?€?t cause any significant damage, authorities said. The 3.6 magnitude earthquake centered off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts, in Buzzards Bay struck just after 9 a.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey?€?s National Earthquake Information Center. The earthquake hit at a depth of a little more than 9.3 miles and was felt across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and into Connecticut and Long Island, New York. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a magnitude 3.5 temblor hit in March 1976, said Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist. About 14,000 people went to the agency?€?s website to report the earthquake, including people from Easthampton, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut, both about 100 miles away, and several from more than 50 miles away in Boston, he said. That?€?s not unusual in New England. ?€?It?€?s common for them to be felt very far away because the rock here is old and continuous and transmits the energy a long way,?€? Caruso said. Ali Kenner Brodsky, who lives in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, not far from the epicenter, was sitting in her kitchen talking with her son, when it hit. ?€?It was a rumbling. It sounded like something exploded. It rumbled. The whole house shook,?€? she said. She said it lasted around 10 to 15 seconds. ?€?In that moment, it feels like it?€?s going on forever.?€? Her husband, Sam, ran to the basement because he thought the boiler blew up. Magnitude 3.6 earthquakes rarely cause major damage, Caruso said. Chris Besse, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said it had not received any reports of significant damage. There were some reports of minor damage. Police in Fall River tweeted that they received numerous phone calls about the quake, including reports of items falling off of shelves, and street signs getting uprooted.      Keep it Clean.

The magnitude 7.5 earthquake near Sand Point, Alaska, generated a tsunami, Scott Langley with the National Tsunami Warning Center said Monday afternoon. Langley said the tsunami sent two waves, each measuring 4 feet, 3 inches high. But observers onshore reported the waves appeared to be 1.5 feet and 2 feet over high tide. The center is monitoring harbors in a 500-mile area along the Alaska coastline, he said. Tsunami advisories issued for parts of Alaska and the state of Hawaii following the earthquake were canceled Monday night, according to tweets from the National Weather Service Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (NWS PTWC). Langley said earlier the area in Alaska that had been subject to the warning and advisory is ""pretty remote."" ""For other US and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America, there is no tsunami threat,"" the center said. The earthquake's epicenter was recorded less than 60 miles from Sand Point, near the Aleutian Peninsula in the southwestern part of the state. ""We did feel it,"" Sand Point Clinic employee Lorna Osterback said of the quake. ""This is a big one."" Osterback said residents of the town would be heading to higher ground away from the shoreline as they wait out the tsunami threat. ""We expect we will have another one in about half an hour,"" noted Osterback. ""We're right on the fault line. I grew up here and it's kind of normal."" Jeanette Piniones Navales moved her family from Kodiak Island to higher ground on Pillar Mountain when the tsunami alerts sounded Monday. She said she has lived in Kodiak since 2014 and this is her sixth time experiencing a tsunami warning. ""I got nervous and immediately convinced my family to move (to) high ground to be safe,"" she told CNN. Candace Nelson, her kids and dogs hid under the table as the earthquake shook Cold Bay, about 90 miles west of Sand Point. ""My kids are all doing good. Brooke, Wilder and Scout all huddled under our kitchen table till the shaking stopped,"" she told CNN as the family waited for more news about the tsunami. ""The dogs were more concerned as to what the heck we were doing under the table."" Residents of Homer could also be seen driving to higher ground after being given evacuation orders. Several aftershocks, including one with a magnitude of 5.9 and one that was 5.8, struck in the hour after the big quake.

The center is monitoring harbors in a 500-mile area along the Alaska coastline, he said. Tsunami advisories issued for parts of Alaska and the state of Hawaii following the earthquake were canceled Monday night, according to tweets from the National Weather Service Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (NWS PTWC). Langley said earlier the area in Alaska that had been subject to the warning and advisory is ""pretty remote."" ""For other US and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America, there is no tsunami threat,"" the center said. The earthquake's epicenter was recorded less than 60 miles from Sand Point, near the Aleutian Peninsula in the southwestern part of the state. ""We did feel it,"" Sand Point Clinic employee Lorna Osterback said of the quake. ""This is a big one."" Osterback said residents of the town would be heading to higher ground away from the shoreline as they wait out the tsunami threat. ""We expect we will have another one in about half an hour,"" noted Osterback. ""We're right on the fault line. I grew up here and it's kind of normal."" Jeanette Piniones Navales moved her family from Kodiak Island to higher ground on Pillar Mountain when the tsunami alerts sounded Monday. She said she has lived in Kodiak since 2014 and this is her sixth time experiencing a tsunami warning. ""I got nervous and immediately convinced my family to move (to) high ground to be safe,"" she told CNN. Candace Nelson, her kids and dogs hid under the table as the earthquake shook Cold Bay, about 90 miles west of Sand Point. ""My kids are all doing good. Brooke, Wilder and Scout all huddled under our kitchen table till the shaking stopped,"" she told CNN as the family waited for more news about the tsunami. ""The dogs were more concerned as to what the heck we were doing under the table."" Residents of Homer could also be seen driving to higher ground after being given evacuation orders. Several aftershocks, including one with a magnitude of 5.9 and one that was 5.8, struck in the hour after the big quake.

Please enter a search term.       SAND POINT, Alaska (KSEE/KGPE) ?€? A preliminary 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck near Alaska on Monday, triggering a tsunami warning. The quake struck in the North Pacific Ocean just before 1 p.m. It was centered about 67 miles (118 kilometers) southeast of Sand Point. The community is about 800 miles (1,288 km) southwest of Anchorage. The quake was recorded at a depth of 19 miles (30 kilometers). Raynelle Gardner, a secretary at Sand Point School in the Aleutians East Borough School District, said things are hectic because ?€?this is an evacuation point.?€? Some schools in the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District were evacuating to higher ground, the district said on Twitter. The tsunami warning was issued by the National Tsunami Warning Center, following an earthquake off Sand Point, Alaska. The size of the quake was originally reported to have been a magnitude of 7.4, but was revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said an earthquake of this size, in this area, is not a surprise. ?€?This is an area where the Pacific Plate is subducting underneath the North American Plate. And because of that, the Pacific Plate actually goes underneath the North American Plate, where it melts,?€? Caruso said, noting that?€?s why there are volcanoes in the region. ?€?And so we commonly have large, magnitude 7 earthquakes in that area.?€? The National Weather Service posted a tsunami warning for parts of the Alaska coastline, from Kennedy Entrance, 40 miles southwest of Homer, to Unimak Pass, 80 miles northeast of Unalaska.   If you are located in this coastal area, move inland to higher ground. Tsunami warnings mean that a tsunami with significant inundation is possible or is already occurring. Tsunamis are a series of waves dangerous many hours after initial arrival time. The first wave may not be the largest. At 1255 PM Alaska Daylight Time on October 19 an earthquake with preliminary magnitude 7.5 occurred 55 miles southeast of Sand Point Alaska. Estimated tsunami start times for selected sites are; Sand Point Alaska 155 PM. AKDT. October 19. Cold Bay Alaska 245 PM. AKDT. October 19. Kodiak Alaska 250 PM. AKDT. October 19. The tsunami warning will remain in effect until further notice. Refer to the internet site tsunami.gov for more information. Unalaska officials sent out a message saying the city is just outside the warning zone and they aren?€?t ordering evacuations right now. Unalaska public safety officials earlier Monday had sent out a release saying they would be conducting tests of the community?€?s tsunami warning sirens. The center said the quake was widely felt in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula. The Alaska Earthquake Center said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. ?€?It was a pretty good shaker here,?€? said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. ?€?We?€?re doing OK.?€? He said all guests were accounted for and ?€?the structure itself is sound.?€?  Rita Tungul, front desk assistant at the Grand Aleutian Hotel in Unalaska, said she felt some shaking but it wasn?€?t strong. Her coworker didn?€?t feel the quake at all, she said. Connie Newton, owner of the Bearfoot Inn, a grocery store, liquor store and small hotel in Cold Bay, said the temblor it felt like someone drove into her building with a truck. Still, nothing fell to the ground and she suffered no damage because she earthquake-proofed her stores by installing 2-inch (5-cm) risers around the outside of her selves.

The Alaska Earthquake Center said the quake was widely felt in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula. The Alaska Earthquake Center said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. ""It was a pretty good shaker here,"" said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. ""We're doing OK."" He said all guests were accounted for and ""the structure itself is sound.""  Rita Tungul, front desk assistant at the Grand Aleutian Hotel in Unalaska, said she felt some shaking but it wasn't strong. Her coworker didn't feel the quake at all, she said. Unalaska officials sent out a message saying the city is just outside the warning zone and they aren't ordering evacuations right now. Unalaska public safety officials earlier Monday had sent out a release saying they would be conducting tests of the community's tsunami warning sirens.

The earthquake hit at a depth of a little more than 9.3 miles and was felt across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and into Connecticut and Long Island, New York. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a magnitude 3.5 temblor hit in March 1976, said Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist. About 14,000 people went to the agency?€?s website to report the earthquake, including people from Easthampton, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut, both about 100 miles away, and several from more than 50 miles away in Boston, he said. That?€?s not unusual in New England. ?€?It?€?s common for them to be felt very far away because the rock here is old and continuous and transmits the energy a long way,?€? Caruso said.

The Friday afternoon quake that struck Turkey?€?s Aegean coast and north of the Greek island of Samos registered a magnitude that Turkish authorities put at 6.6 while other seismology institutes said it measured 6.9. It toppled buildings in Izmir, Turkey?€?s third-largest city, and triggered a small tsunami in the Seferihisar district and on the Greek island. Hundreds of aftershocks followed. At least 28 people were killed in Izmir, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca wrote on Twitter. Among them was an elderly woman who drowned in the tsunami. But rescue teams on Saturday made contact with 38-year old Seher Perincek and her four children?€?ages 3, 7 and 10-year-old twins?€?inside a fallen building in Izmir and cleared a corridor to bring them out. One by one, the mother and three of her children were removed from the rubble as rescuers applauded or hugged. Efforts were still underway to rescue the remaining child, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The survivors, including 10-year-old Elzem Perincek, were moved into ambulances on stretchers. The girl was speaking and said one of her feet hurt. ?€?I?€?m fine; I was rescued because only one of my feet was pinned. That foot really hurt,?€? she said. Earlier Saturday, search-and-rescue teams working on eight collapsed buildings lifted teenager Inci Okan out of the rubble of a devastated eight-floor apartment block. Her dog, Fistik, or Pistachio, was also rescued, Turkish media reported. A video showed a female rescuer trying to calm down the 16-year-old girl under the rubble as she inserted a catheter. ?€?I?€?m so scared,?€? the girl cried. ?€?Can you hold my hand??€? ?€?We are going to get out of here soon,?€? the rescuer, Edanur Dogan, said. ?€?Your mother is waiting outside for you.?€? Friends and relatives waited outside the building for news of loved ones still trapped inside, including employees of a dental clinic that was located on the ground floor. Two other women, aged 53 and 35, were brought out from the rubble of another toppled two-story building earlier on Saturday. In all, around 100 people have been rescued since the earthquake, Murat Kurum, the environment and urban planning minister, told reporters. It was unclear how many more people were trapped under buildings that were leveled. Some 5,000 rescue personnel were working on the ground, Kurum said. Turkey?€?s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD, said 885 people were injured in Izmir and three other provinces. The health minister said seven people were being treated in intensive care, with three of them in critical condition. Two teenagers were killed on Samos after being struck by a collapsing wall. At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. The earthquake, which the Istanbul-based Kandilli Institute said had a magnitude of 6.9, was centered in the Aegean northeast of Samos. AFAD said it measured 6.6. and hit at a depth of some 16 kilometers (10 miles). It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as Athens and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece as well. Authorities warned residents in Izmir not to return to damaged buildings, saying they could collapse in strong aftershocks. Many people spent the night out in the streets, too frightened to return to their homes, even if they sustained no damage. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity, and the leaders of Greece and Turkey held a telephone conversation. ?€?I thank President Erdogan for his positive response to my call,?€? the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Saturday before traveling to Samos, where he visited the families of the teenagers who were killed. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and nominal NATO allies.

Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall and cranes lifted concrete slabs from the wreckage.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul?€?s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey?€?s largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter ?€? roughly 10 kilometers ?€? potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 3,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens.  France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France?€?s ?€?full solidarity with Greece and Turkey?€? and said ?€?we are ready to offer the necessary aid.?€?  The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. Some islanders planned to spend the night in emergency tents for fear of aftershocks. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. ?€?We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,"" Turkey?€?s Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. ""This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We?€?re ready to help if Greece needs it.?€?

Erdogan responded to the tweet with his thanks and offered his condolences. ?€?Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds.

A magnitude 3.1 earthquake's epicenter was near southeast of East Freehold, New Jersey, according to USGS. Public reports suggested the quake was felt as far away as Philadelphia and Long Island. ""I live in Freehold and I thought something hit the house,"" Theresa McAllister said. Most in the area who felt the tremor were not aware what it actually was until later. ""It woke me up like a freight train coming down the tracks, it sounded like a sonic boom,"" said Mike Page.   ""It will take a few days or weeks before analysts can see if there?€?s a specific fault line at cause here,"" Sanders said. He added that structural damage is possible but unlikely. Damages are more likely to be things falling off shelves. In the general New York area, it's slightly more common. Seismologists said that an earthquake similar in size can be expected about once a year in the region. ""There is a consistent pattern in the eastern United States that the earthquakes are responding to a squeezing force in the northeast to southwest direction,"" said John Armbruster of the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory. ""There isn't one big fault line, the rocks around the New York City area are hundreds of millions of years old, they've had a rough life.""  A spokesperson for the Monmouth County Sherrif's Office tells News 4 that there were at least 125 calls in a half-hour span into the 911 call center; no damage was reported. The office also released video from an outside camera that shook for less than a second. The USGS says more than 5,500 people have submitted ""Felt It"" reports online.  The Freehold Police Department said dispatch fielded dozens of calls and that the epicenter of the earthquake was 500 feet away from the police station. A spokesperson for the department said the quake felt more like ?€?the floor dropped out?€? rather than a wavy motion. Unlike earthquakes on the West Coast, the ones that occur on the West Coast are more widely felt, according to USGS. Scientists are researching the reasons but some of the factors have to do with the nature of tectonic plates and the size and age of buildings here. New Jersey's own Department of Environmental Protection says the state is probably overdue for a more significant earthquake, like the magnitude 5.5 temblor that struck in 1884 that caused damage on Staten Island. Such a quake, were it to strike today, would result in ""severe damage"" and would ""likely"" cause fatalities, the state says.  ""Earthquakes are very infrequent, but if a large one happens it would be much more devastating in the East than something out West,"" said Thomas Pratt, of the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program. ""The reason is everything out West is built to withstand earthquakes. Most buildings in the East are not.""","A magnitude 3.1 earthquake's epicenter was near southeast of East Freehold, New Jersey, according to USGS.

The strongest earthquake to hit southern New England in decades rattled homes and nerves Sunday morning, but didn?€?t cause any significant damage, authorities said. The 3.6 magnitude earthquake centered off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts, in Buzzards Bay struck just after 9 a.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey?€?s National Earthquake Information Center. The earthquake hit at a depth of a little more than 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) and was felt across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and into Connecticut and Long Island, New York. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a magnitude 3.5 temblor hit in March 1976, said Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist. About 14,000 people went to the agency?€?s website to report the earthquake, including people from Easthampton, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut, both about 100 miles (160 kilometers) away, and several from more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) away in Boston, he said. That?€?s not unusual in New England. ?€?It?€?s common for them to be felt very far away because the rock here is old and continuous and transmits the energy a long way,?€? Caruso said. Ali Kenner Brodsky, who lives in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, not far from the epicenter, was sitting in her kitchen talking with her son, when it hit. ?€?It was a rumbling. It sounded like something exploded. It rumbled. The whole house shook,?€? she said. She said it lasted around 10 to 15 seconds. ?€?In that moment, it feels like it?€?s going on forever.?€? Her husband, Sam, ran to the basement because he thought the boiler blew up. Magnitude 3.6 earthquakes rarely cause major damage, Caruso said. Chris Besse, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said it had not received any reports of injuries or significant damage. Later Sunday, Besse in an email said there were reports of some structural damage to buildings in New Bedford, and urged anyone who felt the earthquake to check for such damage. The Red Cross tweeted that it was helping 21 people, including children, who had been displaced from their New Bedford homes. There were other reports of minor damage. Police in Fall River tweeted that they received numerous phone calls about the quake, including reports of items falling off of shelves, and street signs getting uprooted. ___ Associated Press reporter Michelle Smith in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.

The Red Cross is reporting that multiple families have been displaced after their homes were damaged by an earthquake that struck off the Massachusetts coast Sunday morning.  According to the USGS, the quake struck at a depth of approximately 6.2 miles.  Initially, the USGS report indicated the magnitude of the earthquake may have been as high as 4.2. That was later revised downward to 4.0 and then again to 3.6. ""You know, when you hear earthquake, your mind starts to race,"" Mattapoisett resident Kyle Jones said. ""I was expecting to open the door and see a crack in the ground or something.""

Bill Keating, who lives on Cape Cod, was among those who felt the rumble. ""All of a sudden, the house shook,"" Keating said. ""The only way I could describe it was it was just like an explosion without the sound."" Residents of Rhode Island, Connecticut and even New Hampshire also reported feeling the earthquake.

The Red Cross of Massachusetts told NewsCenter 5 that three New Bedford homes in the area of Crapo and Nelson streets had to be evacuated due to structural damage caused by the earthquake. As a result, 10 families totaling 22 people have been displaced. The New Bedford Fire Department reports that the bottom 4 feet of the chimney stack on the home at 202 Crapo St. had completely crumbled, and that pipes from the furnaces were leaning over. As a result, the gas had to be shut off in the building, leaving the residents without heat, hot water or stoves. Firefighters said a home across the street, at 195 Crapo St., had the same damage as the home at 202 Crapo St., as the chimney stack had completely crumbled. The home's gas lines also had to be shut down. While checking other house in the area, firefighters said a nearby six-family home had multiple carbon monoxide leaks, and that gas service had to be shut off.

More than 800 others were injured. The quake hit Friday afternoon, toppling buildings in Izmir, Turkey?€?s third largest city, and triggering a small tsunami in the district of Seferihisar and on Samos. The quake was followed by hundreds of aftershocks. Early on Saturday, onlookers cheered as rescuers lifted teenager Inci Okan out of the rubble of a devastated eight-floor apartment block in Izmir's Bayrakli district. Her dog, Fistik, was also rescued, Sozcu newspaper reported. Friends and relatives waited outside the building for news of loved ones still trapped inside, including employees of a dentist?€?s surgery that was located on the ground floor. In another collapsed building, rescuers made contact with a 38-year-old woman and her four children ?€? aged 3, 7 and 10-year old twins ?€? and were working to clear a corridor to bring them out, state-run Anadolu Agency reported.  Two other women, aged 53 and 35, were brought out from the rubble of another toppled two-story building earlier on Saturday. In all, around 100 people have been rescued since the earthquake, Murat Kurum, the environment and urban planning minister, told reporters.  Some 5,000 rescue personnel were working on the ground, Kurum said.  At least 25 people were killed in Izmir, including an elderly woman who drowned, according to Turkey?€?s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD.  Two teenagers were killed on Samos after being struck by a collapsing wall. At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said.  The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. The earthquake, which the Istanbul-based Kandilli Institute said had a magnitude of 6.9, was centered in the Aegean northeast of Samos. AFAD said it measured 6.6. and hit at a depth of some 16 kilometers (10 miles).  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as Athens and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul?€?s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey?€?s largest. Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 87,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece too. Authorities warned residents in Izmir not to return to damaged buildings, saying they could collapse in strong aftershocks. Many people spent the night out in the streets, too frightened to return to their homes, even if they sustained no damage, the DHA news agency reported. More than 3,000 rescue personnel were sent to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens.  In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity while the presidents of Greece and Turkey held a telephone conversation. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and NATO allies. ___ Becatoros reported from Athens.

JUNEAU, Alaska -- A reported 7.5 magnitude earthquake off the Alaska Peninsula on Monday prompted tsunami warnings for a vast swath of communities.  Northern California officials say there is no threat of tsunami off the coast here. The size of the quake was originally reported to have been a magnitude of 7.4, but has been revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. Public safety officials in King Cove sent out an alert urging residents in the coastal area to move inland to higher ground. Some schools in the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District were evacuating to higher ground, the district said on Twitter. The tsunami warning was issued by the National Tsunami Warning Center, following an earthquake off Sand Point, Alaska. The National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, said the tsunami warning was in effect for roughly 950 miles, from 40 miles southeast of Homer to Unimak Pass, about 80 miles northeast of Unalaska.   The Alaska Earthquake Center said the quake was widely felt in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula. The Alaska Earthquake Center said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. ""It was a pretty good shaker here,"" said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. ""We're doing OK."" He said all guests were accounted for and ""the structure itself is sound.""  Rita Tungul, front desk assistant at the Grand Aleutian Hotel in Unalaska, said she felt some shaking but it wasn't strong. Her coworker didn't feel the quake at all, she said. Unalaska officials sent out a message saying the city is just outside the warning zone and they aren't ordering evacuations right now. Unalaska public safety officials earlier Monday had sent out a release saying they would be conducting tests of the community's tsunami warning sirens.

Please enter a search term.       SAN DIEGO ?€? A swarm of mostly small earthquakes were reported Wednesday afternoon in Imperial County, the largest of which was recorded at a magnitude of 4.9, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The agency has recorded nearly 200 quakes of a magnitude of 1 or greater within about a three-mile radius of the 4.9 magnitude quake near Westmorland, a small city in Imperial County north of El Centro, according to Rob Graves, a research geophysicist with USGS. Graves said it?€?s ?€?not uncommon and certainly not unheard of?€? for a swarm of earthquakes to be recorded in the area of the Salton Sea, located north of Westmorland. The area has a complex web of faults between the San Andreas Fault Zone to the north and the Imperial Fault Zone to the south, he said.  ?€?The No. 1 takeaway is that this is a reminder that we?€?re all living in earthquake country,?€? Graves said. ?€?We?€?re in Southern California or California. In general, earthquakes are going to happen. Every once in a while, it?€?s going to be a large, damaging earthquake.?€? He adds, ?€?I can?€?t say with 100% certainty what?€?s going to happen with this swarm activity, but what I take away from that is that it?€?s a reminder to be prepared.?€? According to agency modeling, Graves said the most likely scenario is that similar activity will continue for another day or two. Less likely, he said, would be for a larger quake ?€? between magnitudes 5.5 and 6.5 ?€? to hit the area.  ?€?Most likely is that they?€?ll continue, possibly up to magnitude above 5,?€? he said. ?€?But over the next week or so, that?€?s going to taper off and kind of go back down to the typical level.?€? A similar swarm of quakes was reported in the area in 2012, according to Graves. In August, USGS reported a dozen small quakes in roughly the same area, which drew concern from SDSU professor and geologist Pat Abbott. The agency reported ripples of the quake were felt north of the Salton Sea and to the south near the U.S.-Mexico border as well as in parts of San Diego County. No injuries or damage have been reported thus far.  #ShakingNews here's been a swarm of earthquakes that have been rattling the Brawley/ElCentro area since 4p, The biggest one, a 4.9, was felt in San Diego.#readyforthebigone #beprepared #quakeaware Just felt #earthquake from Mission Valley?€? rocking back and forth for couple seconds

      A 5.5 magnitude earthquake hit Nevada in the early Friday morning hours, according to the US Geological Survey. 
   
      The quake hit a little more than 20 miles southeast of Mina and was followed by aftershocks nearby. Mina is about 160 miles southeast of Reno.
    
      Earlier this year, Nevada saw its largest earthquake in 66 years, when a 6.5 magnitude quake hit a remote area about 225 miles northwest of Las Vegas. 
   
      The powerful May earthquake was felt ?€?in the Reno-Tahoe area, and also throughout the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys in California,?€? Graham Kent, director of the Nevada Seismological Laboratory, said then. 
   
      It was the first large one the state had felt since 1954, he added.

In New Bedford, a total of 22 people were left homeless by the earthquake and are staying in hotels, said Jeff Hall, a Red Cross spokesman. Advertisement No injuries were reported. The quake damaged the natural gas line to one building and left the others with structural damage, Hall said. New Bedford city inspectors are expected to determine whether the buildings can be saved. New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell, in a series of Twitter posts Sunday, asked residents to check their chimneys for damage, particularly in basements, and contact the fire department if they find a problem. Chimneys in at least two houses appeared to have been cracked by the earthquake. Anyone who smells gas should evacuate and then call 911, he said. Damage to chimneys could interfere with a boiler or burner, and lead to a gas or carbon monoxide leak. ?€?It?€?s going to get cold sooner or later, and people will start [turning] on their heating systems,?€? Mitchell said in a video. ?€?We want to make sure they are working, and not damaged.?€? In Dartmouth, which lies near the epicenter, police Detective Kyle Costa said no damage had been reported. Representatives for National Grid and Eversource reported no service interruptions or damage from the quake. Christopher Besse, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said officials had been monitoring the situation following the quake and were ""in contact with local emergency management directors to coordinate state assistance if necessary,?€? he said. Advertisement Beyond New Bedford, there were few signs of major damage. In Cotuit, Kevin Nichols said he could feel his home shake during the earthquake. ?€?It was not a pleasant experience,?€? he said. US Representative William Keating, in an interview with WCVB-TV, described what he experienced during the earthquake. ?€?All of a sudden, the house shook,?€? Keating said. ?€?The only way I could describe it was, it was just like, you know, an explosion without the sound.?€? Dr. John E. Ebel, a Boston College professor of geophysics and a senior research scientist at Weston Observatory, said earthquakes similar to Sunday?€?s happen about once a year in New England. Ebel said there is a better than 50 percent chance that people living  on the South Shore will experience an aftershock from Sunday?€?s quake.  There is also a small possibility, he said, that a more powerful earthquake may occur at some point, though the chances of that  happening are probably no more than 5 percent. But more damaging quakes have occurred in the area.  In 1755, a roughly magnitude 6 earthquake struck off Cape Ann. Roads were blocked by piles of brick from fallen chimneys, he said, and the tower at Faneuil Hall had to be repaired. Ebel said people living in the region should be aware of the potential impact of earthquake  and noted that building codes here have incorporated standards to help structures resist seismic forces. Advertisement ?€?There is a chance for a damaging earthquake centered in the region,?€? Ebel said. It?€?s impossible to predict when one will occur, but ?€?there is every reason to believe there will be one in the future.?€? On Sunday, there was a sense of disbelief as people took to social media to make sure that, yes, they just experienced an earthquake in New England. Did RI just have a tremor or was there an earthquake in the region? Our whole house just shook for 5-10 seconds. My social media friends chimes in from Boston, Worchester and as far as CT that they felt it too. I?€?m seeing a lot of tweets about an earthquake in RI and MA. Felt it here on North Shore of Long Island, NY. Lasted maybe 3 seconds tops. Bed frame and adjacent furniture started shaking. David Goldstein, 62, of South Dennis, said he?€?s never experienced anything like the quake, which he said shook his house. He described it as sounding like a very loud truck rumbling past his home. He and his wife realized what had occurred when they read a Boston Globe report online, he said in a phone interview. He said he thought about reversing a recent decision on his insurance. ?€?The first thing I thought of was to reinstate the earthquake insurance I just canceled,?€? Goldstein said, who joked that his decision led to the quake. ?€?This is probably why we had one. You didn?€?t know I had such power,?€? he said. Nichols, 47, said he was reading the New Yorker when his home shook Sunday morning. The sound, he said, was like that of a sonic boom and lasted for several seconds. His first impression was that his partner was running the washing machine ?€? but immediately reconsidered. ?€?I quickly realized that wasn?€?t possible, because the whole house was shaking,?€?

A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 19 people and injuring over 700 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 17 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey?€?s third-largest city, including one who drowned, and 709 were injured, according to Turkey?€?s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Among the dead were the wife and two children of the secretary-general of the Turkish Medical Association?€?s Izmir branch, the group said. On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying ?€?Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children.?€? At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall and cranes lifted concrete slabs from the wreckage.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul?€?s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey?€?s largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter ?€? roughly 10 kilometers ?€? potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 3,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens. France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France?€?s ?€?full solidarity with Greece and Turkey?€? and said ?€?we are ready to offer the necessary aid.?€? The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. Some islanders planned to spend the night in emergency tents for fear of aftershocks. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. ?€?We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,?€? Turkey?€?s Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. ?€?This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We?€?re ready to help if Greece needs it.?€?

Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones told Eyewitness News the quake was similar in type and location to the deadly 1987 Whittier-Narrows quake which had a magnitude of 5.9. But this one was much smaller in power. ""Here in Pasadena I felt it,"" Jones said. ""It woke me up."" She added that there were at least two aftershocks, measuring 2.1 and 1.6. She also said there is a 5% chance that it was a foreshock to a larger quake.  There is also about a 50% chance of additional small aftershocks within the next 24 hours, she said. The earthquake was initially estimated at 4.8, then downgraded to 4.6 and then to 4.5.

1050,Tsunami warning issued after earthquake near Alaska,2020-10-19 22:11 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/19/us/alaska-earthquake/index.html,1,"
      The magnitude 7.5 earthquake near Sand Point, Alaska, generated a tsunami, Scott Langley with the National Tsunami Warning Center said Monday afternoon.
   
      Langley said the tsunami sent two waves, each measuring 130 centimeters (4 feet, 3 inches) high. But observers onshore reported the waves appeared to be 1.5 feet (45.7 centimeters) and 2 feet (61 cm) over high tide. 
   
      The center is monitoring harbors in a 500-mile area along the Alaska coastline, he said.
   
      Tsunami advisories issued for parts of Alaska and the state of Hawaii following the earthquake were canceled Monday night, according to tweets from the National Weather Service Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (NWS PTWC).
   
      Langley said earlier the area in Alaska that had been subject to the warning and advisory is ?€?pretty remote.?€? 
   
      ?€?For other US and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America, there is no tsunami threat,?€? the center said.
   
      The earthquake?€?s epicenter was recorded less than 60 miles from Sand Point, near the Aleutian Peninsula in the southwestern part of the state.
   
      ?€?We did feel it,?€? Sand Point Clinic employee Lorna Osterback said of the quake. ?€?This is a big one.?€?
   
      Osterback said residents of the town would be heading to higher ground away from the shoreline as they wait out the tsunami threat.  
   
      ?€?We expect we will have another one in about half an hour,?€? noted Osterback. ?€?We?€?re right on the fault line. I grew up here and it?€?s kind of normal.?€? 
   
      Jeanette Piniones Navales moved her family from Kodiak Island to higher ground on Pillar Mountain when the tsunami alerts sounded Monday. She said she has lived in Kodiak since 2014 and this is her sixth time experiencing a tsunami warning.
   
      ?€?I got nervous and immediately convinced my family to move (to) high ground to be safe,?€? she told CNN.
   Tsunami warning again ???? Be safe everyone.. Move to high ground, Keep away from coast until local officials say it is safe to return. 
      Candace Nelson, her kids and dogs hid under the table as the earthquake shook Cold Bay, about 90 miles west of Sand Point.
   
      ?€?My kids are all doing good. Brooke, Wilder and Scout all huddled under our kitchen table till the shaking stopped,?€? she told CNN as the family waited for more news about the tsunami. ?€?The dogs were more concerned as to what the heck we were doing under the table.?€?
   
      Residents of Homer could also be seen driving to higher ground after being given evacuation orders.

In surveillance video outside the center, you can just barely see the camera shake during the quake, which began around 2 a.m., but people near the epicenter definitely felt it. ""My husband thought it was a gas main explosion or something like that,"" said Jennifer Gerstenberg of Freehold.

The earthquake hit at a depth of a little more than 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) and was felt across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and into Connecticut and Long Island, New York. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a magnitude 3.5 temblor hit in March 1976, said Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist. About 14,000 people went to the agency?€?s website to report the earthquake, including people from Easthampton, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut, both about 100 miles (160 kilometers) away, and several from more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) away in Boston, he said.

Ali Kenner Brodsky, who lives in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, not far from the epicenter, was sitting in her kitchen talking with her son, when it hit. ?€?It was a rumbling. It sounded like something exploded. It rumbled. The whole house shook,?€? she said. She said it lasted around 10 to 15 seconds. ?€?In that moment, it feels like it?€?s going on forever.?€?

Later Sunday, Besse in an email said there were reports of some structural damage to buildings in New Bedford, and urged anyone who felt the earthquake to check for such damage. The Red Cross tweeted that it was helping 21 people, including children, who had been displaced from their New Bedford homes. There were other reports of minor damage.

The strongest earthquake to hit southern New England in decades rattled homes and nerves Sunday morning, but didn?€?t cause any significant damage, authorities said. The 3.6 magnitude earthquake centered off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts, in Buzzards Bay struck just after 9 a.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey?€?s National Earthquake Information Center. The earthquake hit at a depth of a little more than 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) and was felt across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and into Connecticut and Long Island, New York. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a magnitude 3.5 temblor hit in March 1976, said Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist. About 14,000 people went to the agency?€?s website to report the earthquake, including people from Easthampton, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut, both about 100 miles (160 kilometers) away, and several from more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) away in Boston, he said. That?€?s not unusual in New England. ?€?It?€?s common for them to be felt very far away because the rock here is old and continuous and transmits the energy a long way,?€? Caruso said. Ali Kenner Brodsky, who lives in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, not far from the epicenter, was sitting in her kitchen talking with her son, when it hit. ?€?It was a rumbling. It sounded like something exploded. It rumbled. The whole house shook,?€? she said. She said it lasted around 10 to 15 seconds. ?€?In that moment, it feels like it?€?s going on forever.?€? Her husband, Sam, ran to the basement because he thought the boiler blew up. Magnitude 3.6 earthquakes rarely cause major damage, Caruso said. Chris Besse, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said it had not received any reports of injuries or significant damage. Later Sunday, Besse in an email said there were reports of some structural damage to buildings in New Bedford, and urged anyone who felt the earthquake to check for such damage. The Red Cross tweeted that it was helping 21 people, including children, who had been displaced from their New Bedford homes. There were other reports of minor damage. Police in Fall River tweeted that they received numerous phone calls about the quake, including reports of items falling off of shelves, and street signs getting uprooted. ___ Associated Press reporter Michelle Smith in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.

A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 19 people and injuring over 700 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 17 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey?€?s third-largest city, including one who drowned, and 709 were injured, according to Turkey?€?s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Among the dead were the wife and two children of the secretary-general of the Turkish Medical Association?€?s Izmir branch, the group said. On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying ?€?Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children.?€? At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall and cranes lifted concrete slabs from the wreckage.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul?€?s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey?€?s largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter ?€? roughly 10 kilometers ?€? potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 3,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens.

Matanuska-Susitna Borough assembly members approved the condemnation 6-1 with George McKee voting against it. The building has been closed since Nov. 30, 2018 after an earthquake caused catastrophic damage. Capital Projects Director Jude Bilafer told the assembly the borough contracted an architectural firm to do ?€?destructive analysis?€? on the building. ?€?We found significantly more damage than anyone anticipated or found,?€? Bilafer said.  Last year the Mat-Su School Board approved a plan to replace the two-story classroom wing that took the brunt of the damage and repair the administrative wing and gym. Jeff Walden, the project management division supervisor, said trying to fix the building would only have brought it about 60% up to code. ?€?We went ahead and designed those repairs but when it came time to estimate what it would cost to actually do the repairs we discovered it was more cost effective to tear it down and start over,?€? Walden said. With the extensive damage the contractors found, the borough estimates it will now cost $34.9 million to tear down and replace the entire facility. There is currently about $25 million in funding approved for the project, about $15 million of which came from insurance money, the borough?€?s finance director, Cheyenne Heindel, told the assembly.  Bilafer asked the assembly to condemn the building, which could make it easier to get federal funds.  ?€?It is in the best interest, the safety, the health of everyone surrounding Houston Middle School, be it inside the school as students, faculty or parents, or even the construction workers, to start from ground zero on this building,?€? Bilafer said. Middle school students have been moved into the high school building and portable classrooms since school resumed after the earthquake. The Mat-Su Borough will put out advertisements to hire a demolition company. Over the winter they?€?ll finish the design phase. Walden expects construction to take about one year.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of this year?€?s drills were held virtually, with organizers broadcasting the drill on Facebook Live. Orange County had 636,209 participants who registered for this year?€?s event, according to the Great California ShakeOut?€?s website, with the majority coming from K-12 schools, colleges, and universities. The state of California as a whole had 6.6 million participants. The drills in Buena Park were conducted at City Hall, the Public Works city yard, and the Buena Park Police Department. Gina Van Stratten, a marketing specialist for the city of Buena Park, told The Epoch Times that ?€?each year that staff participates in this important drill we learn that earthquake preparedness is vital to safety at work.?€? ?€?The more we practice, the more we become comfortable with the appropriate response. We are better prepared for when a big earthquake does strike,?€? Van Stratten said. She said the drill teaches people how to react to a potential emergency situation by using a ?€?mock earthquake?€? for training. ?€?Each staff member is made aware of the mock earthquake and then promptly stops, drops, and takes cover under their desk,?€? she said. ?€?Staff is then told when the mock earthquake has ended, and then each staff member evacuates the building and gathers in their assigned areas in the front and back parking lots. Some staff members have preassigned duties to take a count of the staff in their department to be sure everyone is present and made it out of the building safely.?€? She added that ?€?Buena Park puts staff and public safety first.?€? ?€?We decide to participate so our staff remains safe during an earthquake emergency and then has the capacity to then go back to work and help the rest of the community after the earthquake emergency.?€? Doug Brodowski, operations manager at the Buena Park Public Works Department, told The Epoch Times that his department coordinated its earthquake response efforts with City Hall.  ?€?We teach them to ?€?drop, cover, and hold onto something?€? in their present location. After 15 seconds we announced that the drill is completed. ?€?Then we sound the fire alarms and all persons in the building then exited to the predetermined evacuation location outside the buildings where we take role and ensure that everyone safely exited the buildings.?€? The team then reports to its incident commander at City Hall, Brodowski said. ?€?We then reported ?€? via our emergency radio system that all persons are present and accounted for and that is the end of the drill. We do this periodically to remind our employees of earthquake safety and how to properly exit the building and then account for everyone. ?€?It is a refresher on operating our radio system and reminds everyone of their designated role in these types of emergencies. For example, various employees are assigned and trained for search and rescue, first aid, etc.?€? The group behind the Great ShakeOut, the Southern California Earthquake Center, held a live-streamed video showcasing the online drill, which was held virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the drill, the center exhibited presentations from earthquake and emergency management experts who discussed how to be safe during an earthquake, then allowed users to ask questions. Ilyssa Plumer, the community preparedness officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Region 10, explained to the audience that a little bit of preparation before an earthquake strikes can have a big impact on how safe someone can be.  ?€?It could be simple changes, like moving that tall bookshelf somewhere else that?€?s not near the couch where you sit and spend a lot of time, or actually reinforcing that top bookshelf into the wall so that if the ground starts shaking, it won?€?t fall over. You want to make sure you?€?re sitting and sleeping areas are clear from anything that could fall and injure you.?€? Brian Terbush, the earthquake/volcano program coordinator from the state of Washington?€?s Emergency Management Department, also discussed tips on how to stay safe. ?€?In bed is actually statistically one of the safest places to be during an earthquake,?€? Terbush told viewers. ?€?You just flip over and put your head over your [pillow] or put your pillow over your head, so you have a little bit of extra protection.?€? Althea Rizzo, the Geologic Hazards Program coordinator for Oregon Emergency Management, gave suggestions about what to do if a person is outside. ?€?If you?€?re outdoors, you want to move to an open area and away from buildings, especially if you?€?re in a downtown area,?€? she said. ?€?A lot of times, the facings of those buildings can fall away and cause injuries to people who are passing by. So you want to get down low and move as quickly as possible to an open area away from buildings.?€? The event also introduced a new smartphone app to viewers called ?€?My Shake.?€? The app?€?which alerts each user when an earthquake occurs, depending on location?€?was implemented for this year?€?s drill so that participants would know that it was set up correctly and that they would be warned in the future. Officials recommended that Californians be prepared to be self-sufficient for 72 hours following an earthquake by having certain items handy, including a first-aid kit, food, and enough water for each member of a household to be able to drink a gallon a day for three days. The Great ShakeOut started in 2008 and had nearly 29 million registered participants worldwide this year, including over 12 million people in the United States. ??

This article may contain statements that reflect the opinion of the author
  The researchers said that if Gales Creek were to rupture today, it could cause powerful shaking and widespread damage in the Portland metropolitan area. They detailed their findings in the journal????Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America. Portland sits on the seismically active Cascadia subduction zone, the region of the Pacific Northwest where the Juan de Fuca plate bends and slides beneath the North American plate. Gales Creek lies within the Cascadia forearc, the land wedged between where the Juan de Fuca plate begins to bend and the line of Cascadia volcanoes in Washington and Oregon. Gales Creek runs 45 miles in a northwesterly direction in a forested area of the Coast Range mountains. Mapping and analyzing the fault is difficult as the lush vegetation buries evidence of past earthquakes, such as the cliff-like scarps that form when Earth?€?s crust breaks. They found that????Gales Creek????potentially unleashed????a major????earthquake 8,800 years ago, 4,200 years ago and 1,000 years ago. The fault may also have had ruptured before the first of those earthquakes and after the last one, but evidence for these events was weak.
All told, the researchers estimated that a major earthquake????in Gales Creek happens every 4,000 years.????If the entire fault were to slip today, they calculated that it could unleash????an earthquake of between magnitude 7.1 and magnitude 7.4, depending on the depth of the earthquake?€?s origin.
Nearby faults confound chances of major earthquake
While the next major earthquake isn?€?t likely to happen soon, the researchers noted that the actual risk of the entire fault rupturing is still subject to other factors, such as rupturing nearby faults.
?€?The linkage between rupture on the Gales Creek fault and neighboring faults is still unknown,?€? said lead author Alison Horst, who?€?s now with the????Division of Geology and Earth Resources at the????Washington State Department of Natural Resources????(WADNR).
The most recent earthquake along a similar fault was a magnitude 5.7 quake????that hit March 1993 in????Scott Mills,????Oregon. It caused damages totaling $30 million and was considered one of the largest recorded earthquakes????in the region.
The researchers said????that other faults within the Oregon portion of the Cascadia forearc should be studied to assess past earthquakes. These faults, added Horst, are good areas of study because they?€?re near population centers. (Related:????Catastrophic????earthquake????overdue for California, geologists warn: Are you prepared yet?.)
Earlier this year, earthquake simulations from the WADNR showed that????when a magnitude 9.0 earthquake strikes along Cascadia, it will generate????tsunami waves 10 feet or higher and flood the Washington coast. The initial wave will arrive in the coastal areas 10 to 15 minutes after the ground starts shaking, leaving little time for residents to seek high ground.
Cascadia produces a major earthquake every 300 to 600 years. The last time a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck along the fault was back in 1700.

         NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/CNN) --??A 4.0 magnitude earthquake struck near Bliss Corner, Massachusetts, on Sunday morning, according to preliminary information from the US Geological Survey. The quake was felt more than 100 miles away, in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Sound Beach, New York, on Long Island, the USGS says. According to a USGS map, the quake struck off Mishaum Point, a peninsula in southeastern Massachusetts that extends into Buzzards Bay. The epicenter appears to be about four miles south-southwest of Bliss Corner, which is located in the town of Dartmouth, just south of New Bedford and about 35 miles southeast of Providence, Rhode Island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, and the USGS said there is a low likelihood of casualties or economic losses. There is no threat of tsunami, the National Weather Service says. Small earthquakes strike New England and Long Island roughly twice a year, while moderate ones hit the region every few decades, the USGS says. The most recent New England quake to cause considerable damage was a 5.6 magnitude that shook central New Hampshire in 1940, the survey says.

A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 19 people and injuring over 700 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 17 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey?€?s third-largest city, including one who drowned, and 709 were injured, according to Turkey?€?s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Among the dead were the wife and two children of the secretary-general of the Turkish Medical Association?€?s Izmir branch, the group said. On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying ?€?Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children.?€? At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall and cranes lifted concrete slabs from the wreckage.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul?€?s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey?€?s largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter ?€? roughly 10 kilometers ?€? potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 3,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens. France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France?€?s ?€?full solidarity with Greece and Turkey?€? and said ?€?we are ready to offer the necessary aid.?€? The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. Some islanders planned to spend the night in emergency tents for fear of aftershocks. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. ?€?We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,?€? Turkey?€?s Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. ?€?This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We?€?re ready to help if Greece needs it.?€? Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, tweeted that he had phoned Turkey?€?s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ?€?to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together.?€? Erdogan responded to the tweet with his thanks and offered his condolences. ?€?Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,?€? he wrote. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and NATO allies. Becatoros reported from Athens.

         A magnitude 3.1 earthquake struck in East Freehold, New Jersey, early Wednesday morning, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Residents took to social media to express their shock at the rare occurrence as numerous reports of shaking have been reported across the state and in New York City. Hundreds of people as far away as Philadelphia and Long Island, New York, contributed to the USGS' ""Did You Feel It?"" map, reporting only weak or light shaking and no damage.  ??

NJ.com??reports that on Aug. 23, 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake in central Virginia shook buildings in New Jersey. It was one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded in the eastern U.S. East Coast earthquakes are far less common than in the West, but they tend to be felt over a broad area. ""The waves are able to reverberate and travel pretty happily out for miles,"" said U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Susan Hough. The USGS said the earthquake was centered 1.25 miles south, southeast of the center of East Freehold. It hit just before 2 a.m. ""That's a fairly uncommon event magnitude for quakes in this area,"" Sanders said. Since 1970, there have been two other quakes within 10 miles of this location, a 3.5 in 1979 and a 3.1 in 1992, he said. ??   Copyright ??2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

      It was a long, dizzying week to be a Californian.
   
      The Golden State has been trying to contain the surge of coronavirus cases that started in the summer while dozens of wildfires are burning and smoke is making it hard to breathe. Then, as if not enough crises had collided, Southern California was caught in the clutches of yet another hazard ?€? an earthquake. 
   
      Here?€?s more about what people in California faced last week:
   
      As more than 19,000 firefighters scrambled to contain multiple blazes in the state, they had to mourn one of their own, officials said. 
   
      A firefighter was killed Thursday in Southern California?€?s El Dorado Fire, the blaze sparked this month by a botched gender reveal party, according to the San Bernardino National Forest Service.
   
      The state has seen more than 3.4 million acres scorched so far this year, killing 26 people and reducing hundreds of homes to ashes. 
   
      Numerous communities were ordered to evacuate after the Bobcat Fire in Los Angeles County exploded to 91,000 acres, fueled by strong winds.
   
      Fire officials have warned that warn and dry conditions could elevate the danger of fire over the coming days. 
   
      Smoke from the devastating wildfires has stretched for miles, creating hazardous air conditions in California and nearby states. 
   
      The air was so full of smoke in San Francisco earlier this week that it ranked among the top big cities with worst air quality in the world, according to IQAir, a group which tracks global air quality.
   
      The smoke has impacted other cities, including Los Angeles and even Yosemite National Park, which the National Park Service closed to all visitors last week because conditions were in the unhealthy and hazardous range.
    
      The state appears to be making progress to slow down the spread of coronavirus, but the threat lingers. 
   
      Hospitalizations have dropped 22% in the past two weeks and the percentage of tests coming back positive is down to 3.6% after a surge in cases over the summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news briefing on Wednesday.
   
      ?€?We are moving forward and seeing a decline in the rate of spread and transmission of Covid-19,?€? Newsom said.
    
      But wildfires have become a challenge for health officials. Newsom said access to state?€?s mobile testing sites has been impacted by air quality issues.
    
      Pictures were rattling on the wall, plants were knocked over and some people woke up to beds shaking. 
   
      An earthquake hit near the city of El Monte ?€? east of downtown Los Angeles ?€?late Friday night,  but it was felt widely in San Diego, Valencia and the San Fernando Valley areas, the US Geological Survey said. 
    
      While there were no reports of serious injuries or damage, it was a reminder for those in the greater Los Angeles area that the earthquake risk is far from over.
    
      While experts can?€?t fully predict quake aftershocks, Jones says, the chances of a subsequent larger quake is usually less than 5%.

         FREEHOLD, N.J. (CBSNewYork) -- There was a shocking wake-up call for many in New Jersey way before the dawn Wednesday as an earthquake shook homes and rattled nerves. ""It just shook,"" Freehold Township resident Renee Brookins told CBS2's Vanessa Murdock. ""My entire house was shaking. I thought someone broke in,"" added 15-year-old Alexandra Cappello. ""The wife, the dog, myself, jumped out of bed,"" Freehold's Bob Liamero said. A 3.1 magnitude earthquake centered near Monmouth County's Freehold Township woke a lot of folks, including Amy Carr. In fact, it was her dogs acting nutty that woke her.  ""I went to wake up my husband and he said, 'Oh, you just a bad dream, go back to sleep,'"" Carr said. Both did just that, but in the morning Ryan Carr decided to check his surveillance video. ""I went back to 2 a.m. and you hear a loud bang,"" he said. ""I thought it was an explosion. I thought maybe a house blew up,"" Liamero said. ""I might have thought it was a truck hitting something,"" added Scott Wolman of Freehold.  There were so many reports of hearing that alarming sound, so Murdock asked John Armbruster, a seismologist with Columbia's Lamont Dougherty Earth Observatory, what it was. ""You're hearing the rocks breaking and moving,"" Armbruster said. Thankfully nobody was hurt and no property was damaged. The quake occurred about three miles into the bedrock beneath the Garden State along a fracture or fault, said Art Lerner-Lam, deputy director at Lamont Dougherty. ""This earthquake was in fact felt quite broadly, all the way down to Camden and up through New York and Westchester County,"" Lerner-Lam said. Experts said one of the most surprising things about the earthquake is that is seems so surprising to many. ""Every year or two the New York City area would have something like that,"" Armbruster said. A magnitude 4 happens every 20-30 years. The most recent centered in Ardsley, N.Y. in 1985. A magnitude 5 is the strongest ever felt in the region, and it happens every 100 years or so. The last was in New York City in 1884. ""In a pure mathematical sense, New York is overdue for a magnitude 5 earthquake,"" Armbruster said. Which would cause more than just a rude awakening. ""We felt it, too -- 2020, what else is new?""

          / CBS/AFP
         A massive World War II bomb exploded during a delicate operation on Tuesday to defuse the five-ton device in a channel near the Baltic Sea but no one was harmed, Polish officials said. The device ?€? nicknamed ""Tallboy"" and also known as an ""earthquake bomb""???€? was dropped by the Royal Air Force in an attack on a Nazi warship in 1945. Dramatic drone video shows the detonation spewing water hundreds of feet into the sky, with waves hitting the shore.  It was discovered last year embedded at a depth of 39 feet with just its nose sticking out during dredging close to the port city of Swinoujscie in northwest Poland. More than 6 meters long, it was laden with 2.4 tons of explosives ?€? equivalent to around 3.6 tons of TNT. The navy had said earlier it had ruled out the traditional option of a controlled explosion for fear of destroying a bridge located some 500 meters away. Naval forces used a remote-controlled device to try to ""deflagrate"" the bomb ?€? a technique that if successful burns the explosive charge without causing a detonation, the??BBC's Adam Easton reported from Warsaw. ?? But in the end ""the deflagration process turned into a detonation,"" said Grzegorz Lewandowski, spokesman for the Polish navy's 8th Coastal Defence Flotilla based in Swinoujscie. ""There had been no risk to the individuals directly involved,"" he said, adding that the bomb ""can be considered neutralized."" A Swinoujscie city hall spokesman told AFP he had not heard any reports of anyone injured during the operation by military divers, nor of any damage done to the city's infrastructure. Before the operation began this week, Lewandowski had called it ""a very delicate job,"" adding that ""the tiniest vibration could detonate the bomb"". Around 750 local residents had been urged beforehand to evacuate from an area of 1.6 miles around the bomb, though some had told AFP they would be staying put. Halina Paszkowska had said the ""main danger"" for her was the risk of catching COVID-19 in a sports hall where residents were given shelter during the operation. ""I've lived here 50 years and there have been other bombs, but this is the first time there's an evacuation! Before, we just had to stay indoors,"" she said. Maritime traffic on the navigation channel and surrounding waterways had also been suspended in an area of 16 kilometres around the bomb disposal operation. During World War II, Swinoujscie ?€? at the time Swinemuende, a part of Germany ?€? was home to one of the German navy's most important Baltic bases and was subjected to massive bombardments, said historian Piotr Laskowski, the author of a book on the Royal Air Force raid on Germany's Luetzow cruiser in April 1945. The ship's cannons were being used to hold back the advance of the Red Army in the dying days of the war. On April 16, 1945, the RAF sent 18 Lancaster bombers from the 617th Squadron, known as the ""Dambusters"". The bombers attacked the Luetzow with 12 Tallboys, including the one that failed to explode at the time. Tallboys were designed to explode underground next to a target, triggering shock waves that would cause destruction.   Copyright ??2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

Residents on the Island of Hawai??i are accustomed to feeling earthquakes. As the ground shaking subsides and the safety of everyone around is assured, one of the first questions we typically ask is ?€?how big was that earthquake??€?
Before seismologists had the equipment to calculate magnitudes, people relied on physical damage and human observations. Such observations could be compiled and analyzed to determine where the shaking seemed most intense and identify the epicenter.
By 1930, Hawai?€?i had earthquake report cards that were distributed to the community by HVO staff for people to write detailed information about what they observed during earthquakes.
These report cards became crucial for understanding seismicity while methods for measuring earthquakes were limited or non-existent. The reports helped estimate the sizes of historic earthquakes by comparing how earthquakes were observed in the past to how they are observed today.
Earthquake observations recorded in journals and report cards not only became a portal for scientists to look back in time at the historical seismicity but also provided vital data points that helped determine the intensities of the earthquakes felt in different regions.
ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADIn the early 1900s, Italian volcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli developed a scale to categorize the intensity of shaking from an earthquake based on the effects reported by the impacted community.
This scale has since been adopted in the United States as the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) Scale. The MMI scale is one of the most meaningful earthquake measurements in describing the areal extent and severity of the shaking at the surface.
Different seismogenic regions can produce varying levels of intensity from the same magnitude of earthquake, depending on distance from hypocenter, direction of rupture, underlying geology, and even building design. A single large earthquake might have reports that span the entire I-XII range of the MMI scale.
This is why the MMI scale is the best way to communicate the relative effects among earthquakes. Values are derived from direct observations of the public and will give the best sense of shaking experienced in different regions.
Today, we no longer provide earthquake report cards but instead, you can go online and fill out a ?€?Did You Feel It?€? (DYFI) report, or even check intensities calculated in your region for older events, based on reported observations.
ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADWhile intensity is a great way to assess the effects in areas around the earthquake, seismologists needed an objective and quick method to determine an earthquake?€?s size that does not rely on having a populated area around the earthquakes.
In the 1930s, seismologist Charles Richter came up with the first known method to describe earthquake size based on the maximum amplitude measured from specific seismographs (instruments that measure earthquakes) deployed in southern California.
Richter defined a magnitude-3 earthquake as producing a 1 mm (3/64 inch) peak swing on a torsion seismograph located 100 km (62 miles) away from the earthquake epicenter. He used this arbitrary designation to simply define size of a specific event and with the assumption that other earthquakes could be much smaller or much larger, he invoked the logarithmic scaling. Also central to Richter?€?s work was determining how seismic wave amplitudes varied depending on the distance between the earthquake and recording seismic station.
Richter used a base-10 logarithmic scale, which means that each whole-number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase. But a tenfold increase in what? Does that mean the energy released was ten times bigger?
The tenfold increase on the Richter scale is simply in regard to that max amplitude measurement on the seismogram, or earthquake-record. Energy release is actually portrayed by Richter magnitude logarithmically to approximately base-32, meaning that each whole magnitude increase releases about 32 times the energy.
ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADOther magnitude scales have developed over time with the same principles of taking a physical measurement from the seismogram to produce an objective value, with the intent of emulating the relationship among earthquakes that Richter established.
The next time you feel an earthquake, take the proper safety precautions. Then?€?instead of asking how big that earthquake was?€?fill out your DYFI forms and ask yourself what the intensity was based on your observed effects, and see if the associated magnitude is what you expected!
Volcano Activity Updates
K??lauea Volcano is not erupting. Its USGS Volcano Alert level remains at NORMAL. K??lauea updates are issued monthly.
K??lauea monitoring data for the month of September show variable but typical rates of seismicity and ground deformation, low rates of sulfur dioxide emissions, and only minor geologic changes since the end of eruptive activity in September 2018. The water lake at the bottom of Halema?€?uma?€?u continues to slowly expand and deepen. For the most current information on the lake, go online.
Mauna Loa is not erupting and remains at Volcano Alert Level ADVISORY. This alert level does not mean that an eruption is imminent or that progression to an eruption from the current level of unrest is certain. Mauna Loa updates are issued weekly.
This past week, about 115 small-magnitude earthquakes were recorded beneath the upper-elevations of Mauna Loa; most of these occurred at shallow depths of less than 8 kilometers (about 5 miles). Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements show long-term slowly increasing summit inflation, consistent with magma supply to the volcano?€?s shallow storage system. Gas concentrations and fumarole temperatures as measured at both Sulphur Cone and the summit remain stable. Webcams show no changes to the landscape. For more information on current monitoring of Mauna Loa Volcano, go online.
There was one event with three or more felt reports in the Hawaiian Islands during the past week: an M2.3 earthquake five miles NE of Honomu at a 22-mile depth on Sept. 27 at 7:35 p.m. HST.
HVO continues to closely monitor both K??lauea and Mauna Loa for any signs of increased activity.??Email questions to [email??protected].

The U.S. Geological Survey reported a preliminary 3.1 magnitude earthquake near Freehold Township. The temblor reportedly happened a little more than a mile southeast of East Freehold just after 2 a.m. Wednesday, the USGS said on its Earthquake Hazards Program website minutes after the event. The National Weather Service?€?s Mount Holly office tweeted that the small earthquake was felt ?€?in much of central New Jersey.?€? New Jerseyans in Freehold and beyond posted about the late-night earthquake on social media, checking to see if everyone else felt the same shaking. The rattling woke up some locals who had gone to sleep, while others were startled by the event as they were getting ready to turn in for the night. Some people received earthquake alerts on their phones. New Yorkers said they felt the Jersey event on Staten Island and in Queens. ?€?It sounded like a dump truck being dropped from a few stories up, but about 4-5 blocks away,?€? a Matawan resident reported on an earthquake-tracking website run by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre in Paris. ?€?It rumbled the floor for about 5 seconds. I could feel from my feet on the floor and through the seat of the chair.?€? The U.S. Geological Survey reviewed a report of a 3.1 magnitude earthquake just after 2 a.m. Wednesday.USGS The EMSC, which uses an app called LastQuake to gather witness reports, received accounts from people within a 30-mile radius of the earthquake?€?s origin. ?€?Whole house shook for several seconds at 2 a.m.,?€? an East Brunswick resident reported. ?€?Initially thought it may have been a low flying aircraft or helicopter, but none in the area.?€? ?€?Everyone woke up including the dog,?€? a Roosevelt resident said. ?€?I thought a car hit the garage.?€? Just about nine years ago, on the afternoon of Aug. 23, 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake in central Virginia shook buildings in New Jersey. It was one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded in the eastern U.S.  No major damage was reported in New Jersey at that time, but some buildings were evacuated and many residents felt the shaking in their cars and offices. The 2011 quake was the biggest felt in the state in recent memory, but there have been other minor events. A 2.8 magnitude earthquake hit near Bernardsville in 2015. In 2014, a 1.7 magnitude earthquake rattled New Jersey southeast of Trenton. And in 2012, just days after Hurricane Sandy, a 2.0 magnitude earthquake happened near Ringwood.

Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. ?€? Sparta felt another earthquake over two months after an earthquake led to hundreds of cases of damage in the town.  The damage left behind after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck Sparta on Aug. 9 was worse than initially thought, according to the Town of Sparta. ?€?We are hearing continuous rumbles throughout our community here in town and in Alleghany County, but we thank the Good Lord to this day that there have been no injuries or fatalities,?€? Mayor Wes Brinegar said during a Tuesday news conference. While damage assessments are still ongoing, the Town of Sparta had received about 525 reports of damage as of the close of business Monday, Emergency Management Director Daniel Shoffner said. 60 of these cases have been categorized as ?€?major damage,?€? meaning they lost 40% or more in value. ?€?We underestimated the damage and that was the number one thing. We were looking for major damage in our initial reports, but now, it?€?s coming out more and more with damage more widespread and severe,?€? Brinegar said. Brinegar said many of the people living in Sparta, especially those in the older population, are dealing with the emotional trauma that comes with having a natural disaster. And having 20 aftershocks since the earthquake hasn?€?t helped. ?€?We?€?re still getting those aftershocks and those loud booms periodically. A lot of people are on edge right now and a lot of people have those issues because they?€?re paranoid right now,?€? Brinegar said. The Estep sisters didn?€?t return back to even look at the damage until Tuesday ?€? more than a week after the quake. They own three side-by-side properties that have all been deemed unlivable. ?€?Our parents were here first and all total 54 years,?€? Mary Estep said. In those 54 years, a lot of memories have been made there. ?€?All the Christmas?€? all the holidays, birthday, Thanksgiving was here,?€? Mary Estep said. In a matter of seconds, everything changed. ?€?All of a sudden it was like a bomb went off. Everything was flying and shaking, and it was terrifying. Only thing I was thinking was, ?€?I got to get her out of the kitchen,?€??€? Mary Estep said. As the quake shook photos, books and home d??cor off the walls and shelves, she was in the living room frantically trying to get to her sister Alice Estep. ?€?She was yelling ?€?get out, get out.?€? And I was saying ?€?I?€?m right here, I?€?m right here,?€??€? Alice Estep said. Hanging on to one another, the two women made it to the door only to find that it was blocked from the outside. A neighbor was able to get them out. They own these two homes and the apartments in the middle. All three properties are beyond repair. ?€?This is a loss completely to us. We just don?€?t know where to turn, or what to do,?€? Alice Estep said. While it?€?s going to take months for some people, cleanup efforts have begun for those who?€?ve documented their damages. The emergency management report for damage assessment has been sent to state officials. ?€?We are very much relying on state and federal officials to help put the people in this county,?€? said Daniel Roten, Alleghany County Emergency Management coordinator. He?€?s hopeful the county will get some money to assist individuals in this time of need. ?€?As its been mentioned before, no one here had earthquake insurance ?€? maybe a handful. I can count them on one hand,?€? Roten said. Unfortunately, with every tragedy, Brinegar said it seems like there?€?s someone trying to profit off of it. He said scammers are creating GoFundMe pages asking people to donate. The Red Cross is now housing 19 people from 10 families. The city doesn?€?t have an official GoFundMe for the victims. Brinegar said all assistance will go through the American Red Cross and they do have a fund called ?€?Sparta Alleghany County North Carolina Earthquake.?€? Shoffner says the school system did sustain some damage during the earthquake. The school system has taken the necessary steps to ensure the safety of students and faculty. The area felt eight tremors before the earthquake, as well as 20 aftershocks. The 5.1 earthquake centered in Sparta was felt across North Carolina.  Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. The 5.1 magnitude earthquake in Sparta was the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. THE LATEST HEADLINES FROM FOX8

On Oct. 17, 1989, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the San Francisco Bay Area, killing 67 people. It was the most powerful earthquake to rattle California since the deadly 8.3 quake of 1906 that killed more than 3,000 and leveled much of San Francisco. That quake lasted up to 60 seconds, according to news accounts. The 1989 quake lasted only 10 to 15 but caused more than $5 billion in damage.   Former Review-Journal columnists Royce Feour and Norm Clarke were at Candlestick Park that night and shared memories of what happened. According to the California Department of Conservation, ?€?the epicenter was on the San Andreas fault roughly 56 miles south of San Francisco and 10 miles northeast of Santa Cruz, near Mt. Loma Prieta in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The earthquake was felt as far away as western Nevada.

Down the street at Opie?€?s Cafe and Coffee Shop, the quake rattled the sign above the cash register. ?€?All of a sudden, we feel something shaking and first we think it?€?s my girls upstairs because they?€?re bringing in delivery,?€? said owner Laurie Elder. ?€?The next thing I know, I can feel it under my feet.?€?

Print

 At least 51 people have been killed and nearly 900 injured by the earthquake that toppled buildings in the Turkish city of ??zmir and created sea surges on at least two Greek islands. Rescue teams in Turkey early Sunday morning pulled a man alive from the rubble of a collapsed building. The man, identified as Ahmet Citim, survived for 33 hours under the debris of a residential building that was flattened during the earthquake. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Izmir on Saturday evening and promised the government would help victims who lost their homes with temporary housing and rent, and start construction of new buildings. The deadly 7.0 earthquake originated from a 250-kilometer fault line off the coast of the Greek island of Samos, streaming across the Aegean Sea that divides Turkey and Greece. Hundreds of aftershocks followed. Just hours after the quake, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis placed a rare telephone call to Turkish president to offer his condolences. ?€?Whatever our differences, these are times when people need to stand together,?€? Mitsotakis posted on Twitter.  The United States has saluted the Greek-Turkish earthquake diplomacy and expressed readiness to help the two NATO countries. ""It's great to see both countries putting their differences aside to help each other during a time of need. The United States also stands ready to assist,"" said U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien. France also offered assistance to the countries, extending ?€?full solidarity to both Greece and Turkey.?€? Although Greece and Turkey are both members of NATO, there are perhaps no two allied, neighboring nations whose dealings have been marked with so much conflict and mistrust. Most recently, both sides have been embroiled in a heated energy standoff in the eastern Mediterranean, bringing them to the brink of war during the summer. The European Union and the United States have been working for months in hope of sitting both sides down to negotiate their differences, but to no avail. It remains unclear whether the deadly earthquake can strengthen ties.

One of the children died soon after being rescued, while a fourth child was still trapped. The Friday afternoon quake that struck Turkey?€?s Aegean coast and north of the Greek island of Samos registered a magnitude that Turkish authorities put at 6.6 while other seismology institutes said it measured 6.9. It toppled buildings in Izmir, Turkey?€?s third-largest city, and triggered a small tsunami in the Seferihisar district and on the Greek island. Hundreds of aftershocks followed. At least 36 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey?€?s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD, said. Among them was an elderly woman who drowned in the tsunami. But rescue teams on Saturday made contact with 38-year old Seher Perincek and her four children ?€? ages 3, 7 and 10-year-old twins ?€? inside a fallen building in Izmir and cleared a corridor to bring them out. Search and rescue works continue at debris of Doganlar Apartment located in Bayrakli district after a magnitude 6.6 quake shook Turkey's Aegean Sea coast, in Izmir, Turkey on October 31, 2020.   One by one, the mother and three of her children were removed from the rubble as rescuers applauded or hugged. The survivors, including 10-year-old Elzem Perincek, were moved into ambulances on stretchers. ?€?I?€?m fine; I was rescued because only one of my feet was pinned. That foot really hurt,?€? she said. The health minister as well as rescue worker Ahmet Yavuz told HaberTurk television hours later that one of the children had died after being rescued. They were still trying to reach the other child, Yavuz said. More than 5,500 rescuers from different agencies and cities worked together to reach survivors, at times hushing the crowds to listen into the rubble with sensitive headphones and crawling through the cracks. A 65-year-old man was saved 26 hours after the quake. Rescue work continued in nine buildings. Earlier Saturday, search-and-rescue teams lifted teenager Inci Okan out of the rubble of a devastated eight-floor apartment building. Her dog, Fistik, or Pistachio, was also rescued, Turkish media reported. A video showed a female rescuer trying to calm down the 16-year-old girl under the rubble as she inserted a catheter. ?€?I'm so scared,?€? the girl cried. ?€?Can you hold my hand??€? ?€?We are going to get out of here soon,?€? the rescuer, Edanur Dogan, said. ?€?Your mother is waiting outside for you.?€? Two other women, aged 53 and 35, were brought out from the rubble of another toppled two-story building earlier on Saturday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Izmir and was being briefed at the crisis center. In all, around 100 people have been rescued since the earthquake, Murat Kurum, the environment and urban planning minister, told reporters. It was unclear how many more people were trapped under buildings that were leveled. AFAD said 885 people were injured in Izmir and three other provinces. The health minister said eight people were being treated in intensive care, with three of them in critical condition.  Two teenagers were killed on the island Samos after being struck by a collapsing wall. At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. The earthquake, which the Istanbul-based Kandilli Institute said had a magnitude of 6.9, was centered in the Aegean northeast of Samos. AFAD said it measured 6.6. and hit at a depth of some 16 kilometers (10 miles).  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as Athens and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece as well. Authorities warned residents in Izmir not to return to damaged buildings, saying they could collapse in strong aftershocks. Many people spent the night out in the streets, too frightened to return to their homes, even if they sustained no damage.   In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity, and the leaders of Greece and Turkey held a telephone conversation. ""I thank President Erdogan for his positive response to my call,?€? the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Saturday before traveling to Samos, where he visited the families of the teenagers who were killed. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and nominal NATO allies. The quake occurred as Turkey was already struggling with an economic downturn and the coronavirus pandemic. So far, more than 10,000 people with the virus have died in Turkey. The health minister said authorities were distributing masks and disinfectant to protect against COVID-19. ___ Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey and Bilginsoy reported from Istanbul.

At least 12 people were killed in Izmir, including one who drowned, while 438 were injured, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFA), CNN Turk reported.

The community is about 800 miles (1,288 km) southwest of Anchorage. The quake was recorded at a depth of 19 miles (30 kilometers). Raynelle Gardner, a secretary at Sand Point School in the Aleutians East Borough School District, said things are hectic because ?€?this is an evacuation point.?€? Some schools in the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District were evacuating to higher ground, the district said on Twitter. The tsunami warning was issued by the National Tsunami Warning Center, following an earthquake off Sand Point, Alaska. The size of the quake was originally reported to have been a magnitude of 7.4, but was revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said an earthquake of this size, in this area, is not a surprise. ?€?This is an area where the Pacific Plate is subducting underneath the North American Plate. And because of that, the Pacific Plate actually goes underneath the North American Plate, where it melts,?€? Caruso said, noting that?€?s why there are volcanoes in the region. ?€?And so we commonly have large, magnitude 7 earthquakes in that area.?€? The National Weather Service posted a tsunami warning for parts of the Alaska coastline, from Kennedy Entrance, 40 miles southwest of Homer, to Unimak Pass, 80 miles northeast of Unalaska.   If you are located in this coastal area, move inland to higher ground. Tsunami warnings mean that a tsunami with significant inundation is possible or is already occurring. Tsunamis are a series of waves dangerous many hours after initial arrival time. The first wave may not be the largest. At 1255 PM Alaska Daylight Time on October 19 an earthquake with preliminary magnitude 7.5 occurred 55 miles southeast of Sand Point Alaska. Estimated tsunami start times for selected sites are; Sand Point Alaska 155 PM. AKDT. October 19. Cold Bay Alaska 245 PM. AKDT. October 19. Kodiak Alaska 250 PM. AKDT. October 19. The tsunami warning will remain in effect until further notice. Refer to the internet site tsunami.gov for more information. Unalaska officials sent out a message saying the city is just outside the warning zone and they aren?€?t ordering evacuations right now. Unalaska public safety officials earlier Monday had sent out a release saying they would be conducting tests of the community?€?s tsunami warning sirens. The center said the quake was widely felt in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula. The Alaska Earthquake Center said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. ?€?It was a pretty good shaker here,?€? said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. ?€?We?€?re doing OK.?€? He said all guests were accounted for and ?€?the structure itself is sound.?€?  Rita Tungul, front desk assistant at the Grand Aleutian Hotel in Unalaska, said she felt some shaking but it wasn?€?t strong. Her coworker didn?€?t feel the quake at all, she said. Connie Newton, owner of the Bearfoot Inn, a grocery store, liquor store and small hotel in Cold Bay, said the temblor it felt like someone drove into her building with a truck. Still, nothing fell to the ground and she suffered no damage because she earthquake-proofed her stores by installing 2-inch (5-cm) risers around the outside of her selves.

         SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) -- It lasted for less than a minute, as short as 15 seconds in some Bay Area neighborhoods, but the memories of the deadly and destructive 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake still linger. The quake claimed 63 lives, injured nearly 4,000 and caused widespread damage. It also altered the Bay Area landscape forever. Gone was the Cypress Structure on Highway 880 on Oakland, the Embarcadero and a portion of the Central Freeway.  We asked other KPIX 5 viewers for their memories of that fateful day on our Facebook and social media pages . Patrick Gonzales was a toddler living with his family in El Cerrito. ""Was 5....bottom floor of a 4 plex in El Cerrito, remember heading towards the door, looking back at my mother to say...something...slight shake nothing new, then...I have a snippet of her grasping the doorway in the kitchen and I just hit the floor,"" he posted. ""Dad just off work taking the bus the city to Alameda. Said he ""didn't feel a thing"" & ""I was wondering what everyone was doing outside ????"" ????????????."" Elizabeth Kershner was in class. ""I remember a professor shouting, ""Run for your lives!"" as everyone came out of the building,"" she posted. ""And then I remember hearing on the radio news that ""The Bay Bridge has collapsed."" At first it sounded like the whole bridge had been destroyed."" Christine Ravetti Ravely was at work when the building began to shake.  Michele Dimond was going to class at USF School of Nursing. ""At first, I thought a little trembler, no big deal but about 5 sec after that a huge jolt and the ground felt like water...watching it move through and under your feet was a trip,"" she posted. ""Then silence, the city just went silent, oddest experience."" Maggie Layton was driving home from work. ""I thought I had 4 flat tires when I realized everything was moving,"" she posted. ""Instead of taking 1/2 hour to get home it took me an hour and 1/2. Luckily I was able to stop by my old company so I could call home and let them know I was OK ????"" Kevin Allred was a youngster, excited to be at the World Series game with his family. ""Ironically enough I was only nine years old and was a kid back then,"" he posted. ""My parents and myself were in San Fran at Candlestick in the car. I was trying to get out of the car then a big jolt hit like someone bumped me from behind. I first it was my brother Keith but my father said ""we had an earthquake"" and I panicked. It was scary."" Becky Gardner Kutler Schlueter was also about to leave work. ""Just about ready to leave the office for the day in San Bruno,"" she posted. ""It took a few seconds to realize what was happening and then evacuated the building as soon as it stopped shaking. I remember seeing the windows of the much taller building across the street bowing in and out. I was relatively new to the Bay Area and didn't yet know even where the Cypress Structure was but could not believe the devastation I was finally able to see on TV. Not too many years later I was driving regularly on 880 and crossing the Bay Bridge and often thought about what I'd do if another big one hit Pat Leal lived at the time in the East Bay. She huddled with her husband and little granddaughter, hoping the shaking would stop. ""Lived in San Leandro and had just got home from work,"" she posted. ""My husband my little granddaughter Jacque and I just stood still and I kept saying 'Oh my God' over and over until it stopped. No power for hours. No damaged to our house."" Lesli Fullerton-Pacis was a student at San Francisco State. ""Had just stepped out of the psych building heading across the street to catch the M,"" she said. ""Being outside on a loud corner, I felt the earthquake, but not as much as if I'd been inside. My first clue that it was serious was when the Muni stopped moving. I still didn't know how bad it was until after I had walked from SFSU to my home in Diamond Heights and my mother told me."" Scott Kinkel endured a few moments of embarrassment during his hurried escape into the street.  ""It was still shaking and the water was splashing a couple feet above the community pool across the street,"" he added. ""When it was all over, Yep, that was me, the wet guy in a too small pink robe in the middle of the street."" Lorene La Centra-Templeton posted that fate saved her from the destruction on the Cypress Structure.  Larry Pasion was studying inside the Fremont Main Library. ""(I was) studying before the World Series on the top floor next to the window at the then new Fremont Main Library,"" he posted. ""Felt the initial shake & didn't think anything of it. Then the next few seconds after, everyone took cover. I went under the table and once the shaking stop I got up to look outside only to feel the whole library sway side to side. The library was built on rollers. Didn't realize the effect or the size of the earthquake until I notice the double decker bridge in Oakland had collapsed....still remember it to this day."" Candi Nissim was at a BBQ she will never forget and the friend she lost on that day. ""BBQing burgers to watch the World Series with our neighbors in Concord."" she posted. ""My husband had left work in the City early and was already home (thank goodness). The earthquake hit and when things quieted down we watched in horror the damage it had cause. We watch the rescue efforts in the City of a home collapsed and on fire. It was a dear friend of ours who was trapped in that home and who died in it. There is no words for the anguish and helplessness we felt.""  Dee.Es.Malo remember the fear that gripped her 8-year-old body. ""Running downstairs in our town house in Newark,"" she posted on the KPIX 5 Instagram page.  ""I was bouncing of the walls all the way down! Dad was coming home off the Dumbarton. It took hours for him to get home. Never been more scared in my 8-year-old life."" Taylor tweeted on the  Twitter Page  that a large wave came out of the family pool. ""I was at home in Santa Clara, and watched a wave of pool water come up above the seven foot fence,"" he tweeted. ""And somehow the sandwich I was eating got thrown across the room."" Kaji tweeted about the terrifying moments in the kitchen. ""I was cooking in the kitchen,"" Kaji tweeted. ""The cabinet doors were opened by shake, all of dishes slided down and crushed one by one on the floor. All of furniture were dancing, A big TV jumped down on the floor. I couldn't forget the day in San Francisco. I was lucky that I could survive it.""   ??2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
