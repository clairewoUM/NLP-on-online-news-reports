Sparta continues to feel tremors after 5.1 magnitude earthquake felt across North Carolina,2020-08-11 12:17 UTC,https://myfox8.com/news/sparta-continues-to-feel-tremors-after-5-1-magnitude-earthquake-felt-across-north-carolina/,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term.

The mayor of Sparta, Wes Brinegar, issued a state of emergency on Sunday after a 5.1. earthquake that was felt across North Carolina rattled the town on Sunday. No injuries have been reported.   After the earthquake, the USGS reports that another three tremors at 2.2 magnitude hit the area.    Leading up to the 5.1 magnitude earthquake, USGS says the area felt five earlier tremors. On Saturday, the area was hit with 2.1 and 2.3 magnitude earthquakes, and on Sunday, USGS reports 2.3, 2.6 and 2.2 magnitude earthquakes. The mayor says the 5.1 magnitude earthquake caused widespread minor damage to homes in Sparta with structures and chimneys being knocked off.  He has been visiting homes and businesses throughout the day.  Many local business in Sparta were closed because of damage caused by the earthquake.  The town was under construction at the time the earthquake hit.  A streetscape project has been under construction for a year now. The mayor says if the 100 year-old waterline was still in the ground, it would have been disastrous. Three homes made of rock were damaged, and the three families living in the homes had to be relocated because the homes are no longer safe to live in after the earthquake moved them off the foundation by four to six inches.  As of Sunday, Sparta had felt up to 11 shakes since Saturday with four of them registering over 2.6 magnitude.  There were also six to seven minor shakes throughout Alleghany County Sunday afternoon. The mayor says the town is “not out of the woods yet.”   Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. Sunday’s 5.1 earthquake is the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. A viewer in Pfafftown told us, “Around 8 a.m. this morning, our bedroom shook. We thought a tree had fallen but then heard it was an earthquake.” Experts with the United States Geological Survey are telling people to “be ready for more earthquakes” since aftershocks will continue near the mainshock. “The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,” the website reads. Throughout next week, there is a 4 percent chance that one or more aftershocks will be larger than magnitude 5.1, according to the USGS forecast. Smaller earthquakes are more likely through next week. The chance of a magnitude 3 or higher earthquake is 56 percent. Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily. USGS experts say this earthquake could be part of a sequence.

Please enter a search term.       MEXICO CITY (AP) — A powerful earthquake centered near the southern Mexico resort of Huatulco killed at least four people, swayed buildings in Mexico City and sent thousands fleeing into the streets. Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed and another injured in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise he said reports were of minor damage from the magnitude 7.4 quake, including broken windows and collapsed walls. Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat later said a second person was killed in an apparent house collapse in the tiny mountain village of San Juan Ozolotepec.  Pemex also said the quake caused a fire at its refinery in the Pacific coast city of Salina Cruz, relatively near the epicenter. It said one worker was injured and the flames were quickly extinguished. Churches, bridges and highways also suffered damage during the quake. López Obrador said there had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out to some areas. Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Inside a Mexico City military barracks converted to COVID-19 hospital, medical staff suited in protective equipment tried to calm anxious patients. Unable to evacuate isolation areas, patients huddled under a large beam in the women’s ward while a nurse tried to calm one having a panic attack. Teresa Juárez could only wish for it to pass quickly from her hospital bed where she lay connected to oxygen. Diabetic and with high blood pressure, Juárez said she thought about her five children. “It’s horrible, you’re here and you don’t know what to do,” she said.  It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico. In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued. “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves three to 10 feet above tide levels along parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru and Ecuador. Guatemala’s national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea.

					 Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s press conference was interrupted by an earthquake today. As he was speaking about the protests and getting tested for COVID-19, he learned about an 5.5 magnitude quake in the region.  And although he appeared calm while he was announcing it, he also added some commentary that is quickly going viral online. “As if things couldn’t get worse,” Garcetti said about the earthquake after announcing what had occurred.   The Mayor pretty much sums it up right now in LA. #earthquake pic.twitter.com/xGgVEzzRO4 — Niall Dalton (IRE) (@Stakeshorses) June 4, 2020     — MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) June 4, 2020    Mayor Garcetti saying “as if things couldn’t get worse” after an earthquake interrupted his press conference about coronavirus and thr protests. 😭💀 — Charles O'Keefe (@CharlesAOKeefe) June 4, 2020  Another person said that they thought the earthquake was a lot closer than it was based on what he said during the press conference. He announced it was in San Bernardino and was 5.7 on the Richter scale. Later estimates put the center of the quake at about 103 miles from San Bernardino. Garcetti at the time said they would support the people in San Bernardino after damage was assessed. Then he went back to discussing the importance of being tested for COVID-19.   — Jeff Pope (@JeffPopeRadio) June 4, 2020  Another person said they thought the announcement was fake at first because they couldn’t feel the earthquake.  I didn't feel it, but Eric Garcetti interrupted his BLM statement to talk about the earthquake and it felt like just a distraction from the matter at hand. I legit thought it was fake. haha — matt (@pineasaurus) June 4, 2020  The earthquake happened while many protesters were gathered in downtown Los Angeles.   — David Zahniser 🦅 (@DavidZahniser) June 4, 2020   Mayor Garcetti “uhhh i guess we just had an earthquake” as if things couldn’t get worse. #earthquake #riots #covid #lamayor pic.twitter.com/0Oryc7gUix — visadiva (@VISA_DIVA) June 4, 2020  Although the center of the quake was technically  117.5 miles south-southwest of Los Angeles, according to USGS, the 5.1 magnitude earthquake could still be felt by people in the city. Others tweeted the same feelings about the quake after it happened.

Because the rate of events per day is still way above the rate before the sequence started. — Zachary Ross (@zross_) June 4, 2020    Yes, an earthquake. A M5.5 at the very southern end of the 2019 Ridgecrest aftershock zone.

Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. — Sparta felt another earthquake more than a month after an earthquake led to hundreds of cases of damage in the town.   The damage left behind after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck Sparta on Aug. 9 was worse than initially thought, according to the Town of Sparta.  “We are hearing continuous rumbles throughout our community here in town and in Alleghany County, but we thank the Good Lord to this day that there have been no injuries or fatalities,” Mayor Wes Brinegar said during a Tuesday news conference. While damage assessments are still ongoing, the Town of Sparta had received about 525 reports of damage as of the close of business Monday, Emergency Management Director Daniel Shoffner said. 60 of these cases have been categorized as “major damage,” meaning they lost 40% or more in value. “We underestimated the damage and that was the number one thing. We were looking for major damage in our initial reports, but now, it’s coming out more and more with damage more widespread and severe,” Brinegar said. Brinegar said many of the people living in Sparta, especially those in the older population, are dealing with the emotional trauma that comes with having a natural disaster. And having 20 aftershocks since the earthquake hasn’t helped. “We’re still getting those aftershocks and those loud booms periodically. A lot of people are on edge right now and a lot of people have those issues because they’re paranoid right now,” Brinegar said. The Estep sisters didn’t return back to even look at the damage until Tuesday — more than a week after the quake. They own three side-by-side properties that have all been deemed unlivable. “Our parents were here first and all total 54 years,” Mary Estep said. In those 54 years, a lot of memories have been made there. “All the Christmas’ all the holidays, birthday, Thanksgiving was here,” Mary Estep said. In a matter of seconds, everything changed. “All of a sudden it was like a bomb went off. Everything was flying and shaking, and it was terrifying. Only thing I was thinking was, ‘I got to get her out of the kitchen,’” Mary Estep said. As the quake shook photos, books and home décor off the walls and shelves, she was in the living room frantically trying to get to her sister Alice Estep. “She was yelling ‘get out, get out.’ And I was saying ‘I’m right here, I’m right here,’” Alice Estep said. Hanging on to one another, the two women made it to the door only to find that it was blocked from the outside. A neighbor was able to get them out. They own these two homes and the apartments in the middle. All three properties are beyond repair. “This is a loss completely to us. We just don’t know where to turn, or what to do,” Alice Estep said. While it’s going to take months for some people, cleanup efforts have begun for those who’ve documented their damages. The emergency management report for damage assessment has been sent to state officials. “We are very much relying on state and federal officials to help put the people in this county,” said Daniel Roten, Alleghany County Emergency Management coordinator. He’s hopeful the county will get some money to assist individuals in this time of need. “As its been mentioned before, no one here had earthquake insurance — maybe a handful. I can count them on one hand,” Roten said. Unfortunately, with every tragedy, Brinegar said it seems like there’s someone trying to profit off of it. He said scammers are creating GoFundMe pages asking people to donate. The Red Cross is now housing 19 people from 10 families. The city doesn’t have an official GoFundMe for the victims. Brinegar said all assistance will go through the American Red Cross and they do have a fund called “Sparta Alleghany County North Carolina Earthquake.” Shoffner says the school system did sustain some damage during the earthquake. The school system has taken the necessary steps to ensure the safety of students and faculty.  The area felt eight tremors before the earthquake, as well as 20 aftershocks. The 5.1 earthquake centered in Sparta was felt across North Carolina.  Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. The 5.1 magnitude earthquake in Sparta was the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. Yup, that sure was what you thought you felt.Please do not call 911 simply to report the #earthquake. Only call if you need assistance.  By far the largest quake in North Carolina since a M 5.2 in 1916. #Earthquake pic.twitter.com/J3yuTrdSq5 Developing…

"Ten years after an earthquake devastated their country, many Haitians have little hope",2020-01-13 02:36 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/12/world/haiti-earthquake-ten-years-anniversary-intl/index.html," 
      The devastating force of the 7.0 quake on January 12, 2010, split the country’s history into a before, and an after. Before had been a long, tangled history of dictatorship, occupation and resistance, shot through with the pride of a slave revolution that defeated Napoleon Bonaparte’s army. After was unimaginable – a blank slate. 
   
      “I think they just dropped a bomb on Port-au-Prince,” is what Francoise Chandler, a local UNICEF communications officer, told her daughter after the first tremor struck. She had just picked her up from school. 
   
      “Everything was shaking, and there was a lot of noise. I thought it was like September 11 in New York, because I had been in New York in that period,” Chandler says. Thick dust rose in the air around their car. 
   
      “Are we going die?” she remembers her daughter asking. Chandler replied, “I don’t have the answer to that, but if we’re going to die, we’ll die together.”
   
      Her daughter stopped asking questions then, she says.
   
      According to the US Geological Survey, the earthquake itself lasted less than 30 seconds. The immediate aftermath was horrifying. But an outpouring of solidarity within the country, and between Haiti and the rest of the world, gave many Haitians hope.
   
      “The world really did come together around Haiti,” says CNN’s Sanjay Gutpa, who covered the aftermath extensively and even treated injuries while on the ground. “Not every part of the world, but I think if you were to turn on your televisions, if you were to read the newspaper, if you were to talk to your friends, colleagues at work, there was this collective outpouring of support and compassion for Haiti.”
   
      The world sent firemen from New York City, rescue workers from Iceland, hospital tents from Israel, sniffer dogs from China, oil from Venezuela. NGOs that were already in the country leaped into action. Chandler recalls working out of an open-air tent in the days after the quake because the organization’s offices had crumbled. 
   
      International donors pledged millions, which eventually tallied up to more than $10 billion for reconstruction. The earthquake had been particularly lethal due to the fragile construction of Haiti’s buildings, which crashed down upon their inhabitants.
   
      “Right after the earthquake I felt a lot of hope, because I thought emerging from the catastrophe would make everyone a better person in the service of this country,” says Harold Prévil, an obstetrician and head of Sacre Coeur hospital in Haiti’s northern city of Milot.
   
      But a decade later, he and many others tell CNN they are now disillusioned and have far less hope for their country than they did in the gory aftermath of the earthquake.  
   
      “A lot of money was spent after the earthquake, but the results are meager,” Haitian President Jovenel Moise told CNN in an interview Sunday. 
   
      Moise has publicly acknowledged how little Haiti had had moved forward in the past decade. “Despite our best efforts to rebuild after the earthquake, the scars of this tragic event remain,” he said in a statement on Saturday. “Ten years on, we still lack the basic infrastructure and services to support the people of our country.”
   
      Parts of Haiti that were destroyed in 2010 still have not been rebuilt, including the seat of government, the National Palace. And there is little sign that buildings which have been reconstructed are structurally sound enough to keep inhabitants safe through the next earthquake. 
   
      Whiplashed between disasters both natural and political over the past decade, many Haitians have not had a chance to rebuild mentally or emotionally either, says Marline Naromie Joseph, a Haitian psychologist who has worked with Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) for 12 years. She was on the frontlines of emergency medicine in the aftermath of the quake, working with patients who had lost limbs, children who had lost their parents and colleagues who had borne witness to the quake’s horrors. 
   
      Joseph recalls witnessing the first bodies being collected in a city street on the day after the earthquake. 
   
      “The sound that the bodies made falling into the truck was nauseating,” she says. Further along that same road, workers were separating the dead into piles of children and adults, she recalls – an image which would return to her every time she walked on that street for years and which she eventually realized was evidence of her own trauma. 
    
      “Even though there were no longer the children, no longer the dead, it was as if it were the first day that I was seeing them,” she says. “My brain had saved this image and became stuck on it.”
   
      Some patients still have flashbacks to the sensation of the earth moving beneath their feet when revisiting certain settings – like the hospital’s operating room, she says. 
   
      According to Joseph’s diagnosis, the country’s misfortunes over the past decade have piled stress upon trauma. In the years since the earthquake, the country has been pounded with hurricanes, floods and drought. It’s also been betrayed by human error – tied to a devastating cholera epidemic, for example – and government corruption that has sparked Haiti’s current political unrest.
   
      “We can live with stress, but living with permanent stress will not leave the body without consequence. Eventually, you fall directly into exhaustion,” says Joseph, who notes she has observed more mentally ill people living on the streets than before the earthquake.
   
      One particularly bitter frustration on the earthquake’s 10-year anniversary is how weakened the country’s economy and infrastructure seem to be.
   
      “Ten years after, I am a physician, I am the chief executive officer of a 210-bed facility, but believe me, I am hopeless,” says Prévil, the doctor. “Haitians have not had the opportunity to do things differently and better.”
   
      Some things are better. Haiti’s medical system has widened since the quake, and UNICEF reports that no new cholera cases have been diagnosed since February last year. 
   
      But Prévil and Joseph both say that the country’s medical and mental health resources would nevertheless be insufficient for another disaster on the scale of the 2010 earthquake. 
   
      “I would not say we have an institution capable of dealing with all the psychological trauma of another catastrophe like that,” Joseph says.
   
      The country is currently gripped by skyrocketing inflation, while fuel shortages slow the gears of industry and government. According to a new report by the UN’s disaster relief agency OCHA, rising prices mean even basic supplies are now out of reach for the poor. 
    
      In his Saturday statement, Moise rebuked the rest of the world for failing to follow through on its promises. 
   
      “The initial flurry of attention received from the international community quickly quieted down, with many of the financial pledges not delivered – causing devastating consequences for our recovery,” he said. 
   
      “Little of the aid that was received ended up in Haitian hands and much of the money that was so generously given was not spent on the right projects and places,” Moise added, echoing a common criticism that aid money focused on short-term relief rather than sustainable, long-term systems.
   
      By 2012, $6.4 billion of the more than $10 billion pledged had been disbursed, according to a report by Paul Farmer, a Harvard medical anthropologist who served as the UN’s Deputy Special Envoy for Haiti. 
   
      And while there is little consensus over how much more of the money has been spent, the report on the first two years of spending supports Moise’s point. It noted that “less than 10 percent was disbursed directly to the [Government of Haiti]  using its systems; less than 0.6 percent was disbursed directly to Haitian organizations and businesses as program grants.”
   
      What Haiti’s government has done with the funds it had at its disposal is also a cause for complaint for many citizens. 
   
      For nearly two years now, Haiti has been in political crisis – sometimes punctuated with country-wide lockdowns – over dissatisfaction with the government and how it has dealt with allegations of extraordinary corruption.
   
      The protests were sparked by a fuel price hike and an official report alleging that past administrations had wasted millions of dollars intended for critical infrastructure projects, paying through the nose for contracts on new roads and buildings that went entirely unbuilt, in some cases. That money, stemming from a pre-earthquake deal with Venezuela known as PetroCaribe, will eventually have to be repaid by Haiti’s next generation.
   
      “What frustrated me a lot and made me feel really sad and sick was that I thought that the Haitian people and the Haitians who were in charge of the country would have taken [the earthquake] as an opportunity to make the country better,” says Prévil. 
   
      “But it has not happened. My leaders have become more selfish, they have been robbing more. So instead of taking the opportunity to change the country, they’ve made it worse.”
   
      Haiti has never come out of the darkness of the 2010 earthquake, says Etzer Emile, a Haitian economics researcher and entrepreneur in Port-au-Prince who identifies himself as one of the activists calling for change. He credits the PetroCaribe scandal with drawing local corruption into focus and creating a movement for change, disruptive as it is. 
   
      “You know, that can make us feel (like) … there’s something actually we had, and we didn’t really take advantage of it.”
   
      Now that the government has publicly documented funds lost or disappeared, Emile says the numbers are accessible in a way that they weren’t before. They also can be shared easily thanks to social media, which has fanned outrage and calls for change – including for Moise’s resignation – as anti-corruption activists accuse the President of turning a blind eye to the PetroCaribe allegations.
   
      Moise told CNN that fighting corruption is still a priority of his administration and said that the past months of political unrest have exacerbated Haiti’s economic problems. 
   
      “We need the same solidarity we had after the earthquake,” he said, emphasizing this time he means solidarity with “the actors who are putting the country on a path to change, to economic growth, and development.”
   
      Haiti is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and its location in the Caribbean lies squarely in the middle of a hurricane belt. As it looks toward the future, how Haiti can prepare for the next great disaster – and what kind of help it might receive – are urgent questions.
   
      Emile believes Haiti no longer commands the same interest and compassion that it did in 2010. 
   
      “If Haiti’s reconstruction had been a success, maybe we could have been interesting to people as a case study. But it was a failure, so people feel fed up … they don’t even want to talk about it that much,” he says. “The further we go from the earthquake, the less interested people are in Haiti.”
   
      The drop in interest is, in fact, measurable: A 2019 UN plan for humanitarian aid to Haiti only managed to raise a third of the funding it needed.
   
      Vania André, publisher of the Haitian Times, a paper of record for the Haitian diaspora, says that the earthquake galvanized the loyalty – and a certain defiance – of generations of Haitian Americans. 
   
      It became common to hear stories of Haitian-Americans “leaving their corporate jobs in DC or Florida and moving to Haiti to create a nonprofit,” she says. “They wanted people to see that Haiti is much more than the devastation that happened with the earthquake, that Haiti is much more than this republic of NGOs.” 
   
      But she also notes that many of those same foreign-born idealists did not stay long, discouraged by the skepticism they encountered and the difficulties of doing business.
   
As the flow of foreign aid money ebbs and Haitians lose faith in their government, some say they only thing they can rely on is their own experience. 
   
      Prévil, the obstetrician, says another earthquake would be Haiti’s “worst nightmare” and that he still gets flashbacks to the feeling of the ground moving under his feet. But at least he now knows how to react. 
   
      “If there is another earthquake, I have a good strong desk. I will go under the desk,” he says. “And then I will call for my contingency plan and start right away to take care of as many people as I can. Because I know what to do now.”

Sparta continues to feel tremors after 5.1 magnitude earthquake felt across North Carolina,2020-08-11 12:17 UTC,https://myfox8.com/news/sparta-continues-to-feel-tremors-after-5-1-magnitude-earthquake-felt-across-north-carolina/,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. — Sparta felt a third 2.2 magnitude tremor Tuesday morning, days after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake. The mayor of Sparta, Wes Brinegar, issued a state of emergency on Sunday after a 5.1. earthquake that was felt across North Carolina rattled the town on Sunday. No injuries have been reported.   After the earthquake, the USGS reports that another three tremors at 2.2 magnitude hit the area.    Leading up to the 5.1 magnitude earthquake, USGS says the area felt five earlier tremors. On Saturday, the area was hit with 2.1 and 2.3 magnitude earthquakes, and on Sunday, USGS reports 2.3, 2.6 and 2.2 magnitude earthquakes. The mayor says the 5.1 magnitude earthquake caused widespread minor damage to homes in Sparta with structures and chimneys being knocked off.  He has been visiting homes and businesses throughout the day.  Many local business in Sparta were closed because of damage caused by the earthquake.  The town was under construction at the time the earthquake hit.  A streetscape project has been under construction for a year now. The mayor says if the 100 year-old waterline was still in the ground, it would have been disastrous. Three homes made of rock were damaged, and the three families living in the homes had to be relocated because the homes are no longer safe to live in after the earthquake moved them off the foundation by four to six inches.  As of Sunday, Sparta had felt up to 11 shakes since Saturday with four of them registering over 2.6 magnitude.  There were also six to seven minor shakes throughout Alleghany County Sunday afternoon. The mayor says the town is “not out of the woods yet.”   Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. Sunday’s 5.1 earthquake is the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. A viewer in Pfafftown told us, “Around 8 a.m. this morning, our bedroom shook. We thought a tree had fallen but then heard it was an earthquake.” Experts with the United States Geological Survey are telling people to “be ready for more earthquakes” since aftershocks will continue near the mainshock. “The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,” the website reads. Throughout next week, there is a 4 percent chance that one or more aftershocks will be larger than magnitude 5.1, according to the USGS forecast. Smaller earthquakes are more likely through next week. The chance of a magnitude 3 or higher earthquake is 56 percent. Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily. USGS experts say this earthquake could be part of a sequence.

Please enter a search term.       MEXICO CITY (AP) — A powerful earthquake centered near the southern Mexico resort of Huatulco killed at least four people, swayed buildings in Mexico City and sent thousands fleeing into the streets. Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed and another injured in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise he said reports were of minor damage from the magnitude 7.4 quake, including broken windows and collapsed walls. Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat later said a second person was killed in an apparent house collapse in the tiny mountain village of San Juan Ozolotepec.  Pemex also said the quake caused a fire at its refinery in the Pacific coast city of Salina Cruz, relatively near the epicenter. It said one worker was injured and the flames were quickly extinguished. Churches, bridges and highways also suffered damage during the quake. López Obrador said there had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out to some areas. Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Inside a Mexico City military barracks converted to COVID-19 hospital, medical staff suited in protective equipment tried to calm anxious patients. Unable to evacuate isolation areas, patients huddled under a large beam in the women’s ward while a nurse tried to calm one having a panic attack. Teresa Juárez could only wish for it to pass quickly from her hospital bed where she lay connected to oxygen. Diabetic and with high blood pressure, Juárez said she thought about her five children. “It’s horrible, you’re here and you don’t know what to do,” she said.  It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico. In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued. “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves three to 10 feet above tide levels along parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru and Ecuador. Guatemala’s national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea.

					 Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s press conference was interrupted by an earthquake today. As he was speaking about the protests and getting tested for COVID-19, he learned about an 5.5 magnitude quake in the region.  And although he appeared calm while he was announcing it, he also added some commentary that is quickly going viral online. “As if things couldn’t get worse,” Garcetti said about the earthquake after announcing what had occurred.

He announced it was in San Bernardino and was 5.7 on the Richter scale. Later estimates put the center of the quake at about 103 miles from San Bernardino. Garcetti at the time said they would support the people in San Bernardino after damage was assessed. Then he went back to discussing the importance of being tested for COVID-19.   — Jeff Pope (@JeffPopeRadio) June 4, 2020  Another person said they thought the announcement was fake at first because they couldn’t feel the earthquake.  I didn't feel it, but Eric Garcetti interrupted his BLM statement to talk about the earthquake and it felt like just a distraction from the matter at hand. I legit thought it was fake. haha — matt (@pineasaurus) June 4, 2020  The earthquake happened while many protesters were gathered in downtown Los Angeles.   — David Zahniser 🦅 (@DavidZahniser) June 4, 2020   Mayor Garcetti “uhhh i guess we just had an earthquake” as if things couldn’t get worse. #earthquake #riots #covid #lamayor pic.twitter.com/0Oryc7gUix — visadiva (@VISA_DIVA) June 4, 2020  Although the center of the quake was technically  117.5 miles south-southwest of Los Angeles, according to USGS, the 5.1 magnitude earthquake could still be felt by people in the city.

Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. — Sparta felt another earthquake more than a month after an earthquake led to hundreds of cases of damage in the town.   The damage left behind after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck Sparta on Aug. 9 was worse than initially thought, according to the Town of Sparta.  “We are hearing continuous rumbles throughout our community here in town and in Alleghany County, but we thank the Good Lord to this day that there have been no injuries or fatalities,” Mayor Wes Brinegar said during a Tuesday news conference. While damage assessments are still ongoing, the Town of Sparta had received about 525 reports of damage as of the close of business Monday, Emergency Management Director Daniel Shoffner said. 60 of these cases have been categorized as “major damage,” meaning they lost 40% or more in value. “We underestimated the damage and that was the number one thing. We were looking for major damage in our initial reports, but now, it’s coming out more and more with damage more widespread and severe,” Brinegar said. Brinegar said many of the people living in Sparta, especially those in the older population, are dealing with the emotional trauma that comes with having a natural disaster. And having 20 aftershocks since the earthquake hasn’t helped. “We’re still getting those aftershocks and those loud booms periodically. A lot of people are on edge right now and a lot of people have those issues because they’re paranoid right now,” Brinegar said. The Estep sisters didn’t return back to even look at the damage until Tuesday — more than a week after the quake. They own three side-by-side properties that have all been deemed unlivable. “Our parents were here first and all total 54 years,” Mary Estep said. In those 54 years, a lot of memories have been made there. “All the Christmas’ all the holidays, birthday, Thanksgiving was here,” Mary Estep said. In a matter of seconds, everything changed. “All of a sudden it was like a bomb went off. Everything was flying and shaking, and it was terrifying. Only thing I was thinking was, ‘I got to get her out of the kitchen,’” Mary Estep said. As the quake shook photos, books and home décor off the walls and shelves, she was in the living room frantically trying to get to her sister Alice Estep. “She was yelling ‘get out, get out.’ And I was saying ‘I’m right here, I’m right here,’” Alice Estep said. Hanging on to one another, the two women made it to the door only to find that it was blocked from the outside. A neighbor was able to get them out. They own these two homes and the apartments in the middle. All three properties are beyond repair. “This is a loss completely to us. We just don’t know where to turn, or what to do,” Alice Estep said. While it’s going to take months for some people, cleanup efforts have begun for those who’ve documented their damages. The emergency management report for damage assessment has been sent to state officials. “We are very much relying on state and federal officials to help put the people in this county,” said Daniel Roten, Alleghany County Emergency Management coordinator. He’s hopeful the county will get some money to assist individuals in this time of need. “As its been mentioned before, no one here had earthquake insurance — maybe a handful. I can count them on one hand,” Roten said. Unfortunately, with every tragedy, Brinegar said it seems like there’s someone trying to profit off of it. He said scammers are creating GoFundMe pages asking people to donate. The Red Cross is now housing 19 people from 10 families. The city doesn’t have an official GoFundMe for the victims. Brinegar said all assistance will go through the American Red Cross and they do have a fund called “Sparta Alleghany County North Carolina Earthquake.” Shoffner says the school system did sustain some damage during the earthquake. The school system has taken the necessary steps to ensure the safety of students and faculty.  The area felt eight tremors before the earthquake, as well as 20 aftershocks. The 5.1 earthquake centered in Sparta was felt across North Carolina.  Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. The 5.1 magnitude earthquake in Sparta was the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. Yup, that sure was what you thought you felt.Please do not call 911 simply to report the #earthquake. Only call if you need assistance.  By far the largest quake in North Carolina since a M 5.2 in 1916. #Earthquake pic.twitter.com/J3yuTrdSq5 Developing…

"Ten years after an earthquake devastated their country, many Haitians have little hope",2020-01-13 02:36 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/12/world/haiti-earthquake-ten-years-anniversary-intl/index.html," 
      The devastating force of the 7.0 quake on January 12, 2010, split the country’s history into a before, and an after. Before had been a long, tangled history of dictatorship, occupation and resistance, shot through with the pride of a slave revolution that defeated Napoleon Bonaparte’s army. After was unimaginable – a blank slate. 
   
      “I think they just dropped a bomb on Port-au-Prince,” is what Francoise Chandler, a local UNICEF communications officer, told her daughter after the first tremor struck. She had just picked her up from school. 
   
      “Everything was shaking, and there was a lot of noise. I thought it was like September 11 in New York, because I had been in New York in that period,” Chandler says. Thick dust rose in the air around their car. 
   
      “Are we going die?” she remembers her daughter asking. Chandler replied, “I don’t have the answer to that, but if we’re going to die, we’ll die together.”
   
      Her daughter stopped asking questions then, she says.
   
      According to the US Geological Survey, the earthquake itself lasted less than 30 seconds. The immediate aftermath was horrifying. But an outpouring of solidarity within the country, and between Haiti and the rest of the world, gave many Haitians hope.
   
      “The world really did come together around Haiti,” says CNN’s Sanjay Gutpa, who covered the aftermath extensively and even treated injuries while on the ground. “Not every part of the world, but I think if you were to turn on your televisions, if you were to read the newspaper, if you were to talk to your friends, colleagues at work, there was this collective outpouring of support and compassion for Haiti.”
   
      The world sent firemen from New York City, rescue workers from Iceland, hospital tents from Israel, sniffer dogs from China, oil from Venezuela. NGOs that were already in the country leaped into action. Chandler recalls working out of an open-air tent in the days after the quake because the organization’s offices had crumbled. 
   
      International donors pledged millions, which eventually tallied up to more than $10 billion for reconstruction. The earthquake had been particularly lethal due to the fragile construction of Haiti’s buildings, which crashed down upon their inhabitants.
   
      “Right after the earthquake I felt a lot of hope, because I thought emerging from the catastrophe would make everyone a better person in the service of this country,” says Harold Prévil, an obstetrician and head of Sacre Coeur hospital in Haiti’s northern city of Milot.
   
      But a decade later, he and many others tell CNN they are now disillusioned and have far less hope for their country than they did in the gory aftermath of the earthquake.  
   
      “A lot of money was spent after the earthquake, but the results are meager,” Haitian President Jovenel Moise told CNN in an interview Sunday. 
   
      Moise has publicly acknowledged how little Haiti had had moved forward in the past decade. “Despite our best efforts to rebuild after the earthquake, the scars of this tragic event remain,” he said in a statement on Saturday. “Ten years on, we still lack the basic infrastructure and services to support the people of our country.”
   
      Parts of Haiti that were destroyed in 2010 still have not been rebuilt, including the seat of government, the National Palace. And there is little sign that buildings which have been reconstructed are structurally sound enough to keep inhabitants safe through the next earthquake. 
   
      Whiplashed between disasters both natural and political over the past decade, many Haitians have not had a chance to rebuild mentally or emotionally either, says Marline Naromie Joseph, a Haitian psychologist who has worked with Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) for 12 years. She was on the frontlines of emergency medicine in the aftermath of the quake, working with patients who had lost limbs, children who had lost their parents and colleagues who had borne witness to the quake’s horrors. 
   
      Joseph recalls witnessing the first bodies being collected in a city street on the day after the earthquake. 
   
      “The sound that the bodies made falling into the truck was nauseating,” she says. Further along that same road, workers were separating the dead into piles of children and adults, she recalls – an image which would return to her every time she walked on that street for years and which she eventually realized was evidence of her own trauma. 
    
      “Even though there were no longer the children, no longer the dead, it was as if it were the first day that I was seeing them,” she says. “My brain had saved this image and became stuck on it.”
   
      Some patients still have flashbacks to the sensation of the earth moving beneath their feet when revisiting certain settings – like the hospital’s operating room, she says. 
   
      According to Joseph’s diagnosis, the country’s misfortunes over the past decade have piled stress upon trauma. In the years since the earthquake, the country has been pounded with hurricanes, floods and drought. It’s also been betrayed by human error – tied to a devastating cholera epidemic, for example – and government corruption that has sparked Haiti’s current political unrest.
   
      “We can live with stress, but living with permanent stress will not leave the body without consequence. Eventually, you fall directly into exhaustion,” says Joseph, who notes she has observed more mentally ill people living on the streets than before the earthquake.
   
      One particularly bitter frustration on the earthquake’s 10-year anniversary is how weakened the country’s economy and infrastructure seem to be.
   
      “Ten years after, I am a physician, I am the chief executive officer of a 210-bed facility, but believe me, I am hopeless,” says Prévil, the doctor. “Haitians have not had the opportunity to do things differently and better.”
   
      Some things are better. Haiti’s medical system has widened since the quake, and UNICEF reports that no new cholera cases have been diagnosed since February last year. 
   
      But Prévil and Joseph both say that the country’s medical and mental health resources would nevertheless be insufficient for another disaster on the scale of the 2010 earthquake. 
   
      “I would not say we have an institution capable of dealing with all the psychological trauma of another catastrophe like that,” Joseph says.
   
      The country is currently gripped by skyrocketing inflation, while fuel shortages slow the gears of industry and government. According to a new report by the UN’s disaster relief agency OCHA, rising prices mean even basic supplies are now out of reach for the poor. 
    
      In his Saturday statement, Moise rebuked the rest of the world for failing to follow through on its promises. 
   
      “The initial flurry of attention received from the international community quickly quieted down, with many of the financial pledges not delivered – causing devastating consequences for our recovery,” he said. 
   
      “Little of the aid that was received ended up in Haitian hands and much of the money that was so generously given was not spent on the right projects and places,” Moise added, echoing a common criticism that aid money focused on short-term relief rather than sustainable, long-term systems.
   
      By 2012, $6.4 billion of the more than $10 billion pledged had been disbursed, according to a report by Paul Farmer, a Harvard medical anthropologist who served as the UN’s Deputy Special Envoy for Haiti. 
   
      And while there is little consensus over how much more of the money has been spent, the report on the first two years of spending supports Moise’s point. It noted that “less than 10 percent was disbursed directly to the [Government of Haiti]  using its systems; less than 0.6 percent was disbursed directly to Haitian organizations and businesses as program grants.”
   
      What Haiti’s government has done with the funds it had at its disposal is also a cause for complaint for many citizens. 
   
      For nearly two years now, Haiti has been in political crisis – sometimes punctuated with country-wide lockdowns – over dissatisfaction with the government and how it has dealt with allegations of extraordinary corruption.
   
      The protests were sparked by a fuel price hike and an official report alleging that past administrations had wasted millions of dollars intended for critical infrastructure projects, paying through the nose for contracts on new roads and buildings that went entirely unbuilt, in some cases. That money, stemming from a pre-earthquake deal with Venezuela known as PetroCaribe, will eventually have to be repaid by Haiti’s next generation.
   
      “What frustrated me a lot and made me feel really sad and sick was that I thought that the Haitian people and the Haitians who were in charge of the country would have taken [the earthquake] as an opportunity to make the country better,” says Prévil. 
   
      “But it has not happened. My leaders have become more selfish, they have been robbing more. So instead of taking the opportunity to change the country, they’ve made it worse.”
   
      Haiti has never come out of the darkness of the 2010 earthquake, says Etzer Emile, a Haitian economics researcher and entrepreneur in Port-au-Prince who identifies himself as one of the activists calling for change. He credits the PetroCaribe scandal with drawing local corruption into focus and creating a movement for change, disruptive as it is. 
   
      “You know, that can make us feel (like) … there’s something actually we had, and we didn’t really take advantage of it.”
   
      Now that the government has publicly documented funds lost or disappeared, Emile says the numbers are accessible in a way that they weren’t before. They also can be shared easily thanks to social media, which has fanned outrage and calls for change – including for Moise’s resignation – as anti-corruption activists accuse the President of turning a blind eye to the PetroCaribe allegations.
   
      Moise told CNN that fighting corruption is still a priority of his administration and said that the past months of political unrest have exacerbated Haiti’s economic problems. 
   
      “We need the same solidarity we had after the earthquake,” he said, emphasizing this time he means solidarity with “the actors who are putting the country on a path to change, to economic growth, and development.”
   
      Haiti is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and its location in the Caribbean lies squarely in the middle of a hurricane belt. As it looks toward the future, how Haiti can prepare for the next great disaster – and what kind of help it might receive – are urgent questions.
   
      Emile believes Haiti no longer commands the same interest and compassion that it did in 2010. 
   
      “If Haiti’s reconstruction had been a success, maybe we could have been interesting to people as a case study. But it was a failure, so people feel fed up … they don’t even want to talk about it that much,” he says. “The further we go from the earthquake, the less interested people are in Haiti.”
   
      The drop in interest is, in fact, measurable: A 2019 UN plan for humanitarian aid to Haiti only managed to raise a third of the funding it needed.
   
      Vania André, publisher of the Haitian Times, a paper of record for the Haitian diaspora, says that the earthquake galvanized the loyalty – and a certain defiance – of generations of Haitian Americans. 
   
      It became common to hear stories of Haitian-Americans “leaving their corporate jobs in DC or Florida and moving to Haiti to create a nonprofit,” she says. “They wanted people to see that Haiti is much more than the devastation that happened with the earthquake, that Haiti is much more than this republic of NGOs.” 
   
      But she also notes that many of those same foreign-born idealists did not stay long, discouraged by the skepticism they encountered and the difficulties of doing business.
   
As the flow of foreign aid money ebbs and Haitians lose faith in their government, some say they only thing they can rely on is their own experience. 
   
      Prévil, the obstetrician, says another earthquake would be Haiti’s “worst nightmare” and that he still gets flashbacks to the feeling of the ground moving under his feet. But at least he now knows how to react. 
   
      “If there is another earthquake, I have a good strong desk. I will go under the desk,” he says. “And then I will call for my contingency plan and start right away to take care of as many people as I can. Because I know what to do now.”

Please enter a search term.     Croatia (AP) (12/29/20)— A strong earthquake hit Croatia on Tuesday, with some injuries reported as well as considerable damages to roofs and buildings southeast of the capital. The European Mediterranean Seismological Center said an earthquake of 6.3 magnitude hit 46 kilometers (17 miles) southeast of Zagreb. Initial reports said the earthquake caused wide damage, collapsing roofs, building facades and even some entire buildings. The same area was struck by a 5.2 quake on Monday. The regional N1 television reported live Tuesday from the town of Petrinja, which was hard-hit in the Monday quake, that a collapsed building had fallen on a car. The footage showed firefighters trying to remove the debris from the car, which was buried underneath. The report said a man apparently was in the car when the quake hit. The earthquake was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Serbia and Bosnia. The same area was struck with a 5.2 quake on Monday.

"Earthquake on Sunday brought 'much excitement, but little impact' to Rhode Island",2020-11-10 02:00 UTC,https://www.thewesterlysun.com/news/westerly/earthquake-on-sunday-brought-much-excitement-but-little-impact-to-rhode-island/article_89fb00c4-22ce-11eb-bd80-037d0e96e48a.html," Rain showers early will evolve into a more steady rain overnight. Low 51F. Winds ESE at 10 to 20 mph. Chance of rain 90%. Rainfall near an inch.    This ShakeMap, issued by the United States Geological Survey, shows the intensity and extent of Sunday’s earthquake throughout southern New England. Generated by the USGS regional seismic network, the ShakeMap provides real time maps of ground-shaking and earthquake intensity.  Residents of southern New England were surprised Sunday morning by rumbling and shaking caused by an earthquake on the north shore of Buzzard’s Bay, about 30 miles east of Providence.   John Geiger, a geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colorado, said the earthquake occurred on the Massachusetts coast, about 6.2 miles below the surface. Too small to cause any significant damage but powerful enough to shake homes and rattle windows, the quake was first classified as a magnitude 4, but was later downgraded to a 3.6. Geiger explained that 3.6 was the average magnitude recorded by seismometers. “Basically, we’ll look and see and sometimes, it’s hundreds of stations and we’ll pick where the onset is for the quake for each of those individual stations and each one has its own magnitude and it’s calculated by the different types of [seismic] waves that it sees,” he said. “Sometimes, a particular station may have a much higher magnitude than another station and those are outliers.” As soon Sunday’s quake subsided, the calls started coming in to local police and other emergency responders. “I couldn’t tell you how many, but we received numerous calls right after, wondering what was going on, what happened, what was the shaking,” Westerly Police Chief Shawn Lacey said. “We were probably alerted within two minutes of the earthquake, through our database, that there was actually an earthquake.” “The general public was calling into police dispatch,” Charlestown EMA Director Kevin Gallup said. “I called down there and they said the phones were blowing up … It was pretty much a much a high excitement, low impact event.” In Hopkinton, EMA Director Ron MacDonald III was in church when the quake began. “I heard about 10 to 15 seconds of rumbling,” he said. “I thought it was a military plane or something going overhead. When I was just leaving church, I was getting text messages from all the local emergency managers saying that they thought it was an earthquake. I put out a social media message to my Facebook page explaining what it was.” In Richmond, EMA Director Joseph Arsenault urged residents to make sure there had been no damage to their homes. “The most important thing people want to do it they want to make sure that their house is stable,” he said. “If the house seems to be compromised, make sure you don’t have electricity going. You want to make sure the gas is shut off.” The experience brought back bad memories for Arsenault’s daughter, Kayleigh Hill, who had returned to Rhode Island after living in Anchorage, Alaska, where powerful earthquakes are more common. In Nov. 2018, Hill found herself trying to drive to work during a 7.2 magnitude earthquake, as the road crumbled around her car. Sunday's quake, she said, reminded her of the aftershocks that followed the one in Anchorage. “There were thousands of aftershocks after that 7.2 earthquake, so as soon as you feel it or hear it, you know what it is and you’re like, ‘oh no, another one,’” she said. ""So it’s just kind of like an automatic reaction. As soon as I heard the rumble and the house creaking I was like ‘oh, this is an earthquake. Why are we having an earthquake here? This is Rhode Island.’” The epicenter of the quake was on the North American plate, one of many plates, or rock slabs, that cover the planet. Plate tectonics refers to the movements of those plates along cracks known as faults, and it is those movements that produce earthquakes. There is no documented fault where Sunday’s earthquake occurred, but Geiger said it is likely that an ancient fault exists. “I was looking at it on our map, and I don’t see any fault map,” he said. “That doesn’t mean there’s not a fault there, because if there was an earthquake, then by definition, it was on a fault.  But we don’t have any detailed information on the faults over there.” Compared to states like California and Alaska, southern New England is not a seismically-active region, but powerful earthquakes have been recorded here for centuries. A 6.5 magnitude earthquake, probably originating in New Hampshire, occurred in 1638, just 18 years after the Pilgrims had landed at Plymouth Rock.   “It came with a rumbling noise or low murmur, like unto remote thunder,” he wrote. “It came from the northward and passed southward; as the noise approached nearer, the earth began to shake and came at length with that violence as caused platters, dishes and suchlike things as stood upon shelves, to clatter and fall down. Yea, persons were afraid of the houses themselves.” More big earthquakes followed, a 5.6 in 1727, a 6.5 in 1755, a 5.2 in 1884 and a 5.9 in 1904. Several notable earthquakes have been recorded in the 20th and 21st centuries. Earth is a dynamic planet, Geiger said, and as tectonic plates shift, no matter where they are, sometimes they produce earthquakes. “There are a lot of stresses underneath the surface of the earth and sometimes, that stress is released in the form of earthquakes,” he said. cdrummond@thewesterlysun.com @cynthiadrummon4      Keep it Clean.

From the Archives: ABC7's Peabody Award winning coverage of 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake,2020-10-17 15:58 UTC,https://abc7news.com/the-first-few-hours-abc7s-coverage-of-1989-loma-prieta-earthquake/7105611/,"WATCH LIVE ABC7 News reporter Leslie Brinkley stands at the edge of a collapsed section of the San Francisco Bay Bridge after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. SAN FRANCISCO  (KGO) -- ABC7 News Anchor Cheryl Jennings looks back at the dramatic early hours of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake as both residents and reporters were just beginning to realize the magnitude of what had happened.  Jennings was at a makeshift anchor desk in a badly damaged newsroom as the chilling scenes of disaster began to appear. The earthquake hit Northern California on Oct. 17, 1989, killing 63 people and causing billions of dollars in damage.  It struck just after 5 pm, right as a World Series game between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics was about to start. The shaking lasted for 15 seconds.  When it was over many parts of the Bay Area had lost power and phone service.  Most TV and radio stations were knocked off the air, but ABC7 was uniquely positioned to get the story to the Bay Area and the rest of the world.  Just a few minutes after the earthquake hit, ABC7 used its emergency generator to become the first television station back on the air. The ABC network was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park in San Francisco and had a blimp overhead.  So the blimp was sent to get the first live video of a huge fire that was engulfing the city's Marina District. ABC7's helicopter got dramatic early shots of collapsed sections of the Cypress Freeway in Oakland and the Bay Bridge.  ABC News reporter Leslie Brinkley and photographer John Griffin had just crossed the bridge on the way to another story when the quake hit.  They were the only television crew able to get on the bridge to capture the dramatic rescue of people trapped in cars dangling over the edge of the collapsed section. Throughout the disaster, the station broadcasted continuous information about avoiding dangers with gas and electrical lines, how to survive aftershocks, and, in what proved to be surprisingly valuable advice, how to find emergency information in the telephone book. The station became a clearinghouse for information as a service to other news providers and area residents. ABC7 also helped the relief effort, doing major fundraising for the Red Cross and Salvation Army, and distributing survival information. For outstanding service to its community during a time of crisis, ABC7 received the prestigious Peabody Award. Take a look at ABC7's in-depth coverage of the Loma Prieta earthquake here.

Google Builds Largest Earthquake Detection System With Your Phone,2020-09-25 04:00 UTC,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2020/09/25/google-builds-largest-earthquake-detection-system-with-your-phone/,"If you carry around an Android smartphone, did you know it can be part of the world's largest earthquake detection system? Thanks to a collaboration between Google, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES), the concept is being vetted as a cost-effective alternative to creating a public infrastructure to detect and alert the public to an earthquake in their area. Google Builds Largest Earthquake Detection System With Your Phone Why an Android Phone-Powered Earthquake Alert System? Earthquakes are a daily occurrence around the world. The earlier the millions of people who live in an earthquake-prone region get notified of a quake (before things begin to shake) so they can drop and take cover, the safer they will be. However, traditional earthquake alert systems are costly to build and deploy. Since all smartphones have little accelerometers in them—a device that detects rotation—Google thought that we might be walking around with a solution to an earthquake detection system. Turns out their hunch was right on target, and smartphones can expand their influence to become life-saving emergency notification devices. Tested by Android Device Owners in California Google and collaborators first deployed the Android platform as an earthquake alert system in California. By working with the USGS and Cal OES, Google used the ShakeAlert system to send earthquake alerts. The ShakeAlert system was developed by the country’s leading seismologists. It receives signals from more than 700 seismometers located across the state. While California was able to have this infrastructure in place, many other earthquake-prone areas in the world are not. But the large Android network around the world with millions of smartphones acting as individual seismometers could fill in the gap. If an individual phone's accelerometer detects something it thinks could be an earthquake, it sends the signal to Google servers. Then, algorithms go to work, combining that data with info from other smartphones to figure out if an earthquake is actually happening. For this to be effective, the system is racing the speed of light (essentially the speed of phone data) against the speed of an earthquake. If an earthquake is detected, the system will be able to share accurate information about the extent of the earthquake quickly to those who might face danger because of it. Google is currently testing the system and cautiously rolling out future phases as it builds confidence in the system’s reliability. Eventually, the plans are to deploy it in areas that don’t have traditional seismic-monitoring systems. Android Phones Can Detect Both Types of Earthquake Waves There are two different types of earthquake waves, and the Android phones can detect both. The primary wave or P wave is the fastest and first wave sent out when there's an earthquake. It's followed by a secondary wave or S wave that might be slower but usually bigger and causes more destruction to more people. If the Android system can give early warnings out when the P wave is detected, it could help minimize the damage when the S wave comes through. As anonymized data starts coming to Google's servers, Bayesian filters and other machine learning algorithms get to work to determine if what the phones are reporting is an actual seismic event. If so, warning alerts go out. Phones nearest to the quake’s epicenter will have less warning than those further afield; however, they can play a critical role in helping safeguard those that will experience the larger secondary wave. Google works with seismologists to figure out the appropriate alerts for different levels of earthquakes. When time is of the essence, the alerts must convey critical information concisely. Once Google has refined its earthquake alert system, it does plan to release an API. This paves the way for developers to take the framework built by Google and create solutions for a lot of important use cases that could make living with quakes easier. Imagine if there were systems built to shut off gas valves, transportation management systems such as traffic lights could be manipulated to keep people away from danger and more through future development. For now, Google is focused on refining its system to reduce the number of false positives. Google is including this capability as part of Google Mobile Services, which makes it accessible for most Android phones used today. "

         LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) -- After Friday night's 4.5 magnitude earthquake in South El Monte was felt throughout the Los Angeles Metropolitan area, many Angelenos continued to grow concerned about when the so-called ""Big One"" will strike. Jolts from the earthquake were felt around several communities, including Beverly Hills, Pasadena, Oxnard, Long Beach, Camarillo, Pacoima, Buena Park, San Dimas, Brea, Hawthorne and other areas. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said the focal point was almost in the same location as a magnitude 5.9 earthquake in 1987.  Officials said no injuries or extensive damages were reported, but still urged locals to have a plan in place for future earthquakes and any potential aftershocks. L.A.

"3.1 magnitude earthquake reported in Monmouth County, N.J.",2020-09-09 21:14 UTC,https://6abc.com/31-magnitude-earthquake-hits-freehold-new-jersey/6415086/,"WATCH LIVE No injuries or major damage have been reported from a 3.1 magnitude earthquake. EAST FREEHOLD, N.J. (WPVI) -- No injuries or major damage have been reported from a 3.1 magnitude earthquake felt in Freehold, New Jersey on Wednesday morning. But the tremors were enough to wake people in the middle of the night, flooding the Monmouth County 911 Center with calls. In surveillance video outside the center, you can just barely see the camera shake during the quake, which began around 2 a.m., but people near the epicenter definitely felt it. ""My husband thought it was a gas main explosion or something like that,"" said Jennifer Gerstenberg of Freehold.  ""When I woke up, my friend called me and said that she felt an earthquake and stuff fell off of her shelf,"" said sixth-grade Sarah Gerstenberg. ""Our operators actually in our 911 center located just across the way has experienced what they describe as a jet engine kind of explosion,"" said Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden. Within 30 minutes of the 3.1 magnitude earthquake, the Monmouth County 911 Center received around 125 calls.  ""I heard something,"" said one worried caller. ""Like your house shook? Yeah. So did half the state I guess,"" answered the dispatcher.  Some were asking if an explosion had happened.  ""Our whole building just shook. And a big boom happened,"" one caller said. ""Just get yourself into a safe place, OK? We're not sure what it was, but we do have officers out investigating the area, OK?"" the dispatcher replied. Researchers at Princeton University are spent the day looking at data collected from campus, 30 miles from the epicenter.  ""This is just part of the normal process of the earth's cycle of plate tectonics. The slow building up stress and a sudden release of elastic energy,"" said Frederik Simons, professor of seismology at Princeton University. He said these small earthquakes are normal, we just don't feel them very often. ""Feeling one in New Jersey is extremely rare,"" said Simons. Professor Simons estimated this earthquake could be felt within a radius of 30-50 miles from Freehold. The earthquake, although small, is also relatively uncommon in the region.

2.2M aftershock reported near Sparta following Sunday earthquake,2020-08-10 13:28 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/10/m-aftershock-reported-near-sparta-following-sunday-earthquake/,"(WBTV) - A 2.2 magnitude aftershock was reported near Sparta, North Carolina Monday, a day after a 5.1. magnitude earthquake rocked the area.   Earthquake experts earlier predicted aftershocks following Sunday’s earthquake, which was one of the largest quakes ever reported in the state.  Sparta is in Alleghany County, just east of Ashe County. There have been seven earthquakes around Sparta in the last two days. According to the United States Geological Survey’s aftershock forecast, aftershocks will continue to occur near the earthquake area. “The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,” the website reads. According to the USGS’ Sunday forecast, there is a 5 percent chance of one or more aftershocks that are larger than magnitude 5.1. If any aftershocks of this magnitude were to happen, it is most likely that as few as zero or as many as two such earthquakes may occur. It is more likely that there will be smaller earthquakes over the next week. The chance of an earthquake of magnitude 3 or higher is 57 percent, and it is most likely that as few as zero or as many as 57 such earthquakes may occur in the case that the sequence is re-invigorated by a larger aftershock. Magnitude 3 and above earthquakes are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily. When there are more earthquakes, the chance of a large earthquake is greater which means that the chance of damage is greater. According to USGS, this earthquake could be part of a sequence.  The chance of an earthquake of magnitude 6 or higher is one in 200, such an earthquake is possible but with a low probability. The chance of an earthquake of magnitude 7 or higher is one in 2,000, such an earthquake is possible but with a low probability.  USGS officials say their earthquake forecasts give them an understanding of the chances of having more earthquakes within a given time period in the affected area. They calculate this earthquake forecast using a statistical analysis based on past earthquakes. The forecast changes as time passes due to decline in the frequency of aftershocks, larger aftershocks that may trigger further earthquakes, and changes in forecast modeling based on the data collected for this earthquake sequence.

Sparta mayor issues state of emergency after 5.1 earthquake felt across North Carolina,2020-08-09 20:41 UTC,https://myfox8.com/news/sparta-mayor-issues-state-of-emergency-after-5-1-earthquake-felt-across-north-carolina/,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. — The mayor of Sparta, Wes Brinegar, issued a state of emergency on Sunday after a 5.1. earthquake that was felt across North Carolina rattled the town.   The mayor says there is widespread minor damage to homes with structures and chimneys being knocked off.  He has been visiting homes and businesses throughout the day.  Many local business in Sparta are closed because of damage caused by the earthquake.  The town was under construction at the time the earthquake hit.  A streetscape project has been under construction for a year now. The mayor says if the 100 year-old waterline was still in the ground, it would have been disastrous. Three homes made of rock were damaged, and the three families living in the homes had to be relocated because the homes are no longer safe to live in after the earthquake moved them off the foundation by four to six inches.  Sparta has felt up to 11 shakes since yesterday with four of them registering over 2.6 magnitude.  There have also been six to seven minor shakes throughout Allegheny County this afternoon. The mayor says the town is “not out of the woods yet.”   Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. Sunday’s 5.1 earthquake is the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. A viewer in Pfafftown told us, “Around 8 a.m. this morning, our bedroom shook. We thought a tree had fallen but then heard it was an earthquake.” Experts with the United States Geological Survey are telling people to “be ready for more earthquakes” since aftershocks will continue near the mainshock. “The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,” the website reads. Throughout next week, there is a 4 percent chance that one or more aftershocks will be larger than magnitude 5.1, according to the USGS forecast. Smaller earthquakes are more likely through next week. The chance of a magnitude 3 or higher earthquake is 56 percent. Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily. USGS experts say this earthquake could be part of a sequence.

The shaking was felt all the way in Southern California. FRESNO, Calif. -- A preliminary magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the eastern part of Central California Wednesday morning, according to the USGS. The temblor was reported in the Owens Valley, south of the town of Lone Pine on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  Residents across Central California reported feeling the quake, as did people in some parts of Northern and Southern California. Waves were felt in the Los Angeles basin, 200 miles away from the epicenter. Clovis resident, Ashley Rios, shared a photo with us of a crack in the tile of her home caused by the earthquake. Footage from a grocery store in Lone Pine showed a mess - cans were strewn on the floor and broken glass was everywhere. Lone Pine sits in a gigantic trough between two ranges of the Sierra Nevadas.

LADWP said engineers are examining the dams and waterways following the quake. So far, there have been no reports of damage. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said that the Owens Valley quake is in the same location that a M 4.6 quake was felt two nights ago. That smaller, earlier quake is now considered a foreshock to Wednesday's quake.  Wednesday's quake sent hearts racing in Ridgecrest, where a flurry of shocks, as strong as 7.1, hit last year around the Fourth of July. ""This is a different fault than the Ridgecrest earthquake, and it's far enough away that it doesn't fall within the traditional definition of aftershocks. Rather, we would look at it as its own earthquake,"" Jones said. In the minutes after the magnitude 5.8 earthquake, there were more than a half a dozen aftershocks, ranging from M 2.5 up to M 4.6. As for the statistical chance of a greater earthquake in the area, Jones said with every quake, there is a 5% chance of something bigger.

Magnitude 6.3 Earthquake Hits Croatia; 1 Death Reported,2020-12-29 14:17 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/magnitude-6-3-earthquake-hits-croatia-1-death-reported_3636028.html,"PETRINJA, Croatia—A strong earthquake in Croatia destroyed buildings and killed at least seven people Tuesday southwest of the capital, displacing scores of area residents or making them afraid to sleep indoors as emergency teams searched for those still missing by nightfall.  Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. Another six people were killed in nearly destroyed villages close to the town, according to HRT state television. At least 26 people were hospitalized, six with serious injuries, officials said, adding that many more people remained unaccounted for. In Petrinja, cries could be heard from underneath destroyed houses. One woman was found alive some four hours after the quake. Emergency teams used rescue dogs in the search for survivors, while family members looked on in despair. “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT. “This is like Hiroshima—half of the city no longer exists.” Firefighters worked to remove the debris from a collapsed building that fell on a car. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the vehicle and carried into an ambulance. The town was left without electricity or running water as officials scrambled to set up temporary accommodation for all of the displaced residents in need. Residents fearing another earthquake seemed poised to spend the night outside their homes. Petrinja resident Marica Pavlovic said the quake felt “worse than a war.” “It was horrible, a shock. You don’t know what to do, whether to run out or hide somewhere,” she told The Associated Press. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable,” Plenkovic said. He said the army has 500 places ready in barracks to house people, while others will be accommodated in nearby hotels and other places. “No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” the prime minister said. After another powerful earthquake in Croatia, the 2nd in the past 2 days, I spoke with Prime Minister @AndrejPlenkovic again. We are ready to support. I have asked @JanezLenarcic to stand ready to travel to Croatia as soon as the situation allows. We stand with Croatia. — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) December 29, 2020  
Officials also toured a damaged hospital in the nearby town of Sisak, which was also badly hit. Plenkovic said the patients will be evacuated in army helicopters and ambulances.
Health officials said a baby was delivered in a tent in front of the hospital in the aftermath of the earthquake.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that she spoke with Plenkovic and instructed an envoy to travel to Croatia as soon as possible.
As a Mediterranean country, Croatia is prone to earthquakes, but not big ones. The last strong quake struck in the 1990s when the picturesque Adriatic coast village of Ston was destroyed.
The Croatian military was deployed in the quake-hit region to help with the rescue operation.
Croatian seismologist Kresimir Kuk described the earthquake as “extremely strong,” far stronger than another one that hit Zagreb and nearby areas in the spring. He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky old buildings and move to newer areas of the city because of aftershocks.
In the capital, people ran into the streets in fear.
The earthquake was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia, and Slovenia. It was felt as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported.
Authorities in Slovenia said the Krsko nuclear power plant was temporarily shut down following the earthquake. The power plant is jointly owned by Slovenia and Croatia and located near their border.

He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky old buildings and move to newer areas of the city because of aftershocks. In the capital, people ran into the streets in fear. The earthquake was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia, and Slovenia. It was felt as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported. Authorities in Slovenia said the Krsko nuclear power plant was temporarily shut down following the earthquake. The power plant is jointly owned by Slovenia and Croatia and located near their border.

Did you feel that? Earthquake strikes off Massachusetts coast and is felt in parts of NH,2020-11-08 16:01 UTC,https://www.wmur.com/article/earthquake-strikes-massachusetts-november-8-2020/34610473,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox.  The rumble with a 3.6 magnitude was centered on Buzzards Bay, southwest of Bliss Corner in Dartmouth, the USGS said, and struck at a depth of a little more than 15 kilometers (9.3 miles). Initially, the USGS report indicated the magnitude of the earthquake may have been as high as 4.2. That was later revised downward to 4.0, and then again to 3.6.  Residents of southern New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut have also reported feeling the earthquake. The Red Cross of Massachusetts told WCVB that three New Bedford homes in the area of Crapo and Nelson streets had to be evacuated due to structural damage caused by the earthquake. As a result, 10 families totaling 22 people have been displaced.  According to USGS records, the last time New England saw an earthquake this strong was on Oct. 16, 2012, when a 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck near Saco, Maine.

Magnitude 4.2 earthquake hits off Mass. coast; CT residents affected,2020-11-08 14:42 UTC,https://www.wtnh.com/news/magnitude-4-2-earthquake-hits-off-mass-coast-ct-residents-affected/,"WTNH.com Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       CONNECTICUT (WTNH/WPRI) — The United State Geological Survey (USGS) confirmed an earthquake hit off the coast of Massachusetts on Sunday morning. Connecticut residents said they felt it up and down the state.  WHOA!!  4.0-magnitude earthquake shook the ground near Bliss Corner, MA which is just south of New Bedford!  It was about 9 miles deep, but still felt here in CT! @WTNH pic.twitter.com/QXfiEfkuem The USGS called it a 4.0 magnitude but said it was a 3.6 on Monday. Experts said it’s uncommon to have an earthquake of this magnitude in this area. The magnitude of Sunday’s quake is significant for this region. Rhode Island has an earthquake history, but they are usually referred to as tremors in the 1-2 magnitude range.   News 8 viewers reported feeling the earthquake in areas of Eastern Connecticut such as Essex, North Stonington, Ledyard and Mystic — with additional reports from Hartford County and New Haven County. However, according to Governor Ned Lamont, no damage has been reported in CT as a result of the quake. The quake lasted only seconds, but it did leave damage in some places. A man in Bedford, Massachusetts, reported minor damage inside his apartment, finding more by the furnace in the basement, as well. His report prompted his neighbors to check their homes, too, where they found crumbling bricks and even carbon monoxide leaks. Scientists said there may be aftershocks but they shouldn’t be strong enough to cause more damage or even be felt.  Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

4.0 Magnitude Earthquake In Massachusetts Rocks Several New England Towns,2020-11-08 14:28 UTC,https://www.inquisitr.com/6374252/massachusetts-earthquake/," According to meteorologist Fred Campagna, the earthquake hit off the coast of Buzzards Bay on Cape Cod and was felt in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. “It was a typical shallow [earthquake], approximately 15.1 km deep – that’s about 9 miles. USGS has revised it to a magnitude 4.0,” Campagna tweeted. Earlier reports indicated that the earthquake was slightly stronger at 4.2.  — WCVB-TV Boston (@WCVB) November 8, 2020  Several social media users have taken to Facebook and Twitter to ask if others had felt their homes shake, wondering whether or not what they felt was indeed an earthquake. Many compared the sensation to a large truck driving by outside, while others felt the shaking was more intense and instantly knew it was an earthquake. “I felt it too in the Hartford area of [Connecticut]. I woke up to it thinking it was my lil brother rocking my bed,” one Twitter user wrote. “Felt in Warwick, [Rhode Island], for several seconds. More than I’ve ever felt here before,” added another. Warwich is located about 42.1 miles from Bliss Corner. “Here in New Bedford it was bad. Whole house shook for like 10 seconds,” tweeted a third. New Bedford, Massachusetts, is located about 2.1 miles from the earthquake’s center. “Felt on Cape Cod! Came to Twitter to see if it was an earthquake or if I was losing my mind,” wrote a fourth person. The state of Massachusetts is not prone to earthquakes, but they have happened over the years. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Massachusetts has recorded more than 400 known earthquakes that were felt by residents since 1668. The largest in history was the Cape Ann earthquake in 1775. That quake was between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale and caused damage to hundreds of buildings in the city of Boston. Prior to this morning’s earthquake, the most recent was recorded in Western Massachusetts back in November 2012, with a magnitude of 1.9. Nearby residents did not feel any rumbles from that particular event, however. Interestingly, this was not the first earthquake near Bliss Corner, Massachusetts. On May 15, 2011, a 2.1-magnitude quake was recorded about 12 miles from Woods Hole and 11 miles from Bliss Corner.

"Earthquake strikes Turkish coast and Greek island, killing 14",2020-10-30 18:49 UTC,https://abc7ny.com/earthquake-strikes-turkish-coast-and-greek-island-killing-14/7479646/,"WATCH LIVE A strong earthquake in the Aegean Sea has shaken Turkey and Greece. Several buildings were wrecked in Turkey's western Izmir province, according to officials. ISTANBUL -- A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 14 people and injuring over 500 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 12 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, including one who drowned, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said 522 people were injured, with five undergoing surgery and eight in intensive care.  On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying ""Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children."" At least 19 people were injured in Samos, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul's governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey's largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter - roughly 10 kilometers - potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 2,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens. France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France's ""full solidarity with Greece and Turkey"" and said ""we are ready to offer the necessary aid."" The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. ""We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,"" Turkey's Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. ""This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We're ready to help if Greece needs it."" Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, tweeted that he had phoned Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ""to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together."" Erdogan responded to the tweet with his thanks and offered his condolences. ""Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,"" he wrote. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and NATO allies.

"Earthquake strikes Turkish coast and Greek island, killing 14",2020-10-30 18:49 UTC,https://abc7.com/earthquake-strikes-turkish-coast-and-greek-island-killing-14/7479646/,"WATCH LIVE A strong earthquake in the Aegean Sea has shaken Turkey and Greece. Several buildings were wrecked in Turkey's western Izmir province, according to officials. ISTANBUL -- A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 14 people and injuring over 500 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 12 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, including one who drowned, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said 522 people were injured, with five undergoing surgery and eight in intensive care.  On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying ""Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children."" At least 19 people were injured in Samos, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul's governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey's largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter - roughly 10 kilometers - potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 2,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens. France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France's ""full solidarity with Greece and Turkey"" and said ""we are ready to offer the necessary aid."" The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers.

"Strong Aegean Sea earthquake topples buildings in Turkey, shakes parts of Greece",2020-10-30 13:15 UTC,https://abc13.com/strong-aegean-sea-earthquake-topples-buildings-in-turkey/7479646/,"WATCH LIVE A strong earthquake in the Aegean Sea has shaken Turkey and Greece. Several buildings were wrecked in Turkey's western Izmir province, according to officials. ISTANBUL -- A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 14 people and injuring over 500 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 12 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, including one who drowned, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said 522 people were injured, with five undergoing surgery and eight in intensive care.  On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying ""Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children."" At least 19 people were injured in Samos, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul's governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey's largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter - roughly 10 kilometers - potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 2,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens. France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France's ""full solidarity with Greece and Turkey"" and said ""we are ready to offer the necessary aid."" The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity.

         VALLEY VILLAGE (CBSLA) -- Since the magnitude 4.5 earthquake that shook Angelenos out of bed on Friday night, several smaller quakes have hit this week — including a magnitude 3.2 near Rancho Cucamonga and a 3.3 near Lake Elsinore. ""[There's] a bit of anxiety around when is the next one going to happen,"" said Valley Village resident Rachel Aune. Aune said she's still rattled after the series of quakes. ""We've been in California for the past 10 years, and we haven't felt any like we have in the past year,"" she said. ""So that is concerning."" Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said that this series of quakes is normal for Southern California, and the area averages about 10 magnitude 4 or above earthquakes every year. Magnitude 3 earthquakes occur, on average, every week. ""The earthquake is inevitable but the disaster is not,"" Jones said. ""When you put it in Los Angeles, in the basin, this one was in the San Gabriel Valley, many more people feel it."" The active seismic week has left many on edge, wondering what might be ahead. Dr. Jones said that a cluster of small quakes does not necessarily mean the area is free from a big one. ""You can never get enough small ones to replace the big one...since that ratio is constant,"" she said. ""You need a big one to keep the ratio constant, and it's the most consistent thing we record about earthquakes all over the world is this ratio of large to small. Places that have small earthquakes have lots of big ones."" Glenn Pomeroy — the CEO of the California Earthquake Authority, a nonprofit earthquake insurance company — said these tremors are always a good reminder for people to have an earthquake plan, especially as people are spending more time at home due to the pandemic. ""Whenever there is an earthquake, our website traffic increases,"" he said. ""Our policy sales skyrocketed after the Ridgecrest earthquake. There is more that we can do. Most people don't have earthquake insurance. they have to know it's not covered in their homeowners policy and federal assistance will be limited, and they ought to give it some thought whether its through us or someone else."" This is earthquake country, after all, Dr. Jones said. And the best way to combat fear is to be prepared. ""You shouldn't be more scared of having an earthquake now because we had that 4.5 last week, but you shouldn't be less scared,"" she said. ""Remember that the earthquakes are part of Southern California, and they don't have to be a disaster. You can prevent most of the damage... but you need to educate yourself."" The state's largest earthquake preparedness drill, The Great Shakeout, is on Oct. 5. This normally happens in schools and offices across the state, but due to COVID-19 many will be participating from home.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

         SOUTH EL MONTE (CBSLA) -- A 4.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Los Angeles area late Friday night, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.  The focal point of the earthquake was almost the same location as the M5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquake in 1987, according to seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones. There have been reports that the quake was felt in La Habra, Long Beach, Oxnard, Ontario, Pasadena, near the Beverly Hills area, and other regions throughout L.A. County. Some residents said they felt jolts from about three seconds to possibly up to a minute long. All 106 fire stations in the city of Los Angeles activated, each checking their areas for damage, according to Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph M. Terrazas.   This is one of the largest earthquakes in the Los Angeles Basin in a few years. Jones said that 5% of the time, an initial earthquake may actually be a foreshock that is preceding a larger earthquake. There is also an approximately 50% chance that an aftershock around 3.0 magnitude strength could be felt, according to Jones. There were no reports of extensive damages or injuries in the city of L.A. on Friday night, Chief Terrazas said.  The Los Angeles Police Department also said there were ""no significant incidents to report"" related to the earthquake, but urged residents to have plans in place should aftershocks occur. Per our Department Operations Center, fortunately there are no significant incidents to report related to the 4.6 magnitude earthquake. Be prepared for potential aftershocks & only use 911 for emergencies. You can use 877-ASK-LAPD for non-emergencies in the City of Los Angeles. Call 911 for emergencies or dial 877-275-5273 (877-ASK-LAPD) for non-emergencies in the City of Los Angeles.

Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. — The damage left behind after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck Sparta on Aug. 9 was worse than initially thought, according to the Town of Sparta.  “We are hearing continuous rumbles throughout our community here in town and in Alleghany County, but we thank the Good Lord to this day that there have been no injuries or fatalities,” Mayor Wes Brinegar said during a Tuesday news conference. While damage assessments are still ongoing, the Town of Sparta had received about 525 reports of damage as of the close of business Monday, Emergency Management Director Daniel Shoffner said. 60 of these cases have been categorized as “major damage,” meaning they lost 40% or more in value. “We underestimated the damage and that was the number one thing. We were looking for major damage in our initial reports, but now, it’s coming out more and more with damage more widespread and severe,” Brinegar said. Brinegar said many of the people living in Sparta, especially those in the older population, are dealing with the emotional trauma that comes with having a natural disaster. And having 20 aftershocks since the earthquake hasn’t helped. “We’re still getting those aftershocks and those loud booms periodically. A lot of people are on edge right now and a lot of people have those issues because they’re paranoid right now,” Brinegar said. The Estep sisters didn’t return back to even look at the damage until Tuesday — more than a week after the quake. They own three side-by-side properties that have all been deemed unlivable. “Our parents were here first and all total 54 years,” Mary Estep said. In those 54 years, a lot of memories have been made there. “All the Christmas’ all the holidays, birthday, Thanksgiving was here,” Mary Estep said. In a matter of seconds, everything changed. “All of a sudden it was like a bomb went off. Everything was flying and shaking, and it was terrifying. Only thing I was thinking was, ‘I got to get her out of the kitchen,’” Mary Estep said. As the quake shook photos, books and home décor off the walls and shelves, she was in the living room frantically trying to get to her sister Alice Estep. “She was yelling ‘get out, get out.’ And I was saying ‘I’m right here, I’m right here,’” Alice Estep said. Hanging on to one another, the two women made it to the door only to find that it was blocked from the outside. A neighbor was able to get them out. They own these two homes and the apartments in the middle. All three properties are beyond repair. “This is a loss completely to us. We just don’t know where to turn, or what to do,” Alice Estep said. While it’s going to take months for some people, cleanup efforts have begun for those who’ve documented their damages. The emergency management report for damage assessment has been sent to state officials. “We are very much relying on state and federal officials to help put the people in this county,” said Daniel Roten, Alleghany County Emergency Management coordinator. He’s hopeful the county will get some money to assist individuals in this time of need. “As its been mentioned before, no one here had earthquake insurance — maybe a handful. I can count them on one hand,” Roten said. Unfortunately, with every tragedy, Brinegar said it seems like there’s someone trying to profit off of it. He said scammers are creating GoFundMe pages asking people to donate. The Red Cross is now housing 19 people from 10 families. The city doesn’t have an official GoFundMe for the victims. Brinegar said all assistance will go through the American Red Cross and they do have a fund called “Sparta Alleghany County North Carolina Earthquake.” Shoffner says the school system did sustain some damage during the earthquake. The school system has taken the necessary steps to ensure the safety of students and faculty.  The area felt eight tremors before the earthquake, as well as 20 aftershocks. The 5.1 earthquake centered in Sparta was felt across North Carolina.  Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. The 5.1 magnitude earthquake in Sparta was the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. Yup, that sure was what you thought you felt.Please do not call 911 simply to report the #earthquake. Only call if you need assistance.  By far the largest quake in North Carolina since a M 5.2 in 1916. #Earthquake pic.twitter.com/J3yuTrdSq5 Developing…

University of Memphis sends researchers to study North Carolina earthquake,2020-08-14 17:16 UTC,https://www.wxii12.com/article/university-memphis-research-study-north-carolina-earthquake/33607175,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. Just days after a historic 5.1 magnitude earthquake hit the state of North Carolina, some scientists and other officials are on the ground in the Sparta, North Carolina, area. Folks from the University of Memphis’ Center for Earthquake Research and Information are working with the USGS and other state officials, trying to learn more about the quake.   A geologist with the University of Memphis's Center for Earthquake Research and Information told WXII 12 News, while big events like what happened Sunday are rare, the data collected can help keep people safe.  Hours after the 5.1 magnitude earthquake rattled the state, scientists and others were on the ground in the Sparta area trying to gather as much information as possible.   “What was the fault that ruptured and how big is it? Will it rupture again? So the aftershock data allow us to capture some of the information on the size of that fault and its location and its orientation,” said Gary Patterson, a geologist and the Director of Education and Outreach at the Center for Earthquake Research and Information at the University of Memphis. The initial quake damaged hundreds of buildings, but no one was seriously hurt. Geologist Gary Patterson with the University of Memphis’s Center for Earthquake Research and Information, or CERI, said a team was sent to the area to use four portable seismograph stations like this one below. “These are very high-quality, battery-charged, solar-powered computers in a can that can have a very high dynamic range. They can stay on scale even when the vibrations are very large or very small,” said Patterson. So far, Patterson said they have been able to locate 12-14 aftershocks following the main-shock and eight foreshocks.   “It’ll tell us more about the source characteristics of the seismic sources in your area. And that can go into building codes and especially for critical facilities, roads, bridges, nuclear power plants, wastewater treatment plants,” he said. Patterson said while earthquakes like these occur less frequently in this part of the country, he says understanding the science behind the quake can help both the state and federal government prepare for the next big seismic event.  CERI says the 5.1 earthquake on Aug. 9 was the largest event to have occurred in this area since 1916.

The shaking was felt all the way in Southern California. FRESNO, Calif. -- A preliminary magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the eastern part of Central California Wednesday morning, according to the USGS. The temblor was reported in the Owens Valley, south of the town of Lone Pine on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  Residents across Central California reported feeling the quake, as did people in some parts of Northern and Southern California. Waves were felt in the Los Angeles basin, 200 miles away from the epicenter. Clovis resident, Ashley Rios, shared a photo with us of a crack in the tile of her home caused by the earthquake.

LADWP said engineers are examining the dams and waterways following the quake. So far, there have been no reports of damage. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said that the Owens Valley quake is in the same location that a M 4.6 quake was felt two nights ago. That smaller, earlier quake is now considered a foreshock to Wednesday's quake. Wednesday's quake sent hearts racing in Ridgecrest, where a flurry of shocks, as strong as 7.1, hit last year around the Fourth of July. ""This is a different fault than the Ridgecrest earthquake, and it's far enough away that it doesn't fall within the traditional definition of aftershocks. Rather, we would look at it as its own earthquake,"" Jones said. In the minutes after the magnitude 5.8 earthquake, there were more than a half a dozen aftershocks, ranging from M 2.5 up to M 4.6. As for the statistical chance of a greater earthquake in the area, Jones said with every quake, there is a 5% chance of something bigger.

													California Earthquake near Ridgecrest & LA						
					 A magnitude 5.5 earthquake has been reported nearly 14 miles west of Ridgecrest, California and 117 miles south-southwest of Los Angeles. Experts say this is an aftershock from the Ridgecrest sequence of nearly a year ago. Read on for more details and to see a map of the earthquake’s location. According to USGS.gov, the earthquake was located near the following area that you can see in the map below. You can see the interactive map here.  USGS Cal Tech seismologist Zachary Ross said on Twitter that the earthquake today was the largest aftershock of the Ridgecrest sequence that began a year ago. Early reports indicated the quake was a magnitude 5.1, but it’s now estimated to be a magnitude 5.5. You can see a closeup of the earthquake’s estimated location below.

[BREAKING] 4.9 Magnitude Earthquake Shakes Southern California; How Bad is the Damage?,2020-04-04 03:21 UTC,https://www.techtimes.com/articles/248585/20200403/breaking-4-9-magnitude-earthquake-shakes-southern-california-how-bad-is-the-damage.htm,"  As explained, an average of 234 earthquakes with magnitudes of 3.0 to 4.0 occur each year in California and Nevada, according to a recent three-year data sample. Study shows that California has always been a center of earthquakes compared to other states. The earthquakes are caused by the movement of huge blocks of the earth's crust- the Pacific and North American plates. For example, the Pacific plate is moving northwest and scrapes it for 2 inches per year.  And this is just a normal phenomenon that happens in the area.  A magnitude 4.9 earthquake recently hit the Southern part of California and its neighboring counties tonight, April 3.  According to the United States Geological Survey, the earthquake was also experienced the most 8 miles from Palm Springs. Effects were also felt as far as San Diego, Riverside and Orange counties, with some people as far away as Los Angeles saying they felt some tremors.  Reports of casualties or building damage have not yet confirmed. Residents near California have already expressed their thoughts and panic on social media saying that after all the things that are currently happening in the world, this is not what they wanted to have at the moment.   Earthquake expert Lucy Jones explained the quake saying that it is normal for the Southern part of California to experience earthquakes as this is no longer new to the state. She said that the ""quake hit either near or on the San Jacinto fault, which she said has seen many quakes of that range over the years."" As reported in the Los Angeles Times, an average of 25 earthquakes with magnitudes between 4.0 and 5.0 occur per year in California and Nevada, according to a recent three-year data sample.   Sign up for our free newsletter for the Latest coverage!

6.5-Magnitude Earthquake Shakes Idaho,2020-04-01 11:04 UTC,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/earthquake-idaho-montana-utah/2020/04/01/id/960854/,"

Wednesday, 01 April 2020 07:04 AM EDT

 A large earthquake struck north of Boise Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking. The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke's Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn't interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho's coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation's highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. ""It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,"" he said. The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. ""Until the next one, I guess,"" Smith said. ""I mean, that's what we do. We're all good."" Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it. ""I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,"" Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. ""The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I'm sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating."" Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay. That quake was along what scientists call a ""normal fault,"" with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday's quake appeared to be on an unmapped ""strike-slip fault,"" causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line. ""This is one that wasn't obvious enough to be mapped before now,"" Jones said. Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they're less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists. Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake. ""An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn't surprise us,"" she said. ""They do every bit as much damage."" People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said. ""Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,"" Jones said. ""Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake. Just get down and try to cover.""

Powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake strikes between Cuba and Jamaica,2020-01-28 19:40 UTC,https://fox61.com/2020/01/28/powerful-7-7-magnitude-earthquake-strikes-between-cuba-and-jamaica/,The page you are looking for can’t be found.
Tsunami threat message issued after magnitude 7.7 earthquake off the coast of Jamaica,2020-01-28 19:40 UTC,https://fox61.com/2020/01/28/tsunami-threat-message-issued-after-magnitude-7-7-earthquake-off-the-coast-of-jamaica/,"A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Tuesday about 80 miles from Jamaica, shaking people in the Caribbean and as far away as Miami. A tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica, or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. A tsunami threat alert was lifted Tuesday afternoon, a few hours after the quake. Alec Pultr, who lives in Ogier, Grand Cayman, said it wasn’t the first earthquake he’s experienced but it was the biggest “by far.” “We were simply working and things started to sway,” he told CNN. As the swaying and shaking became more violent, most people started to run; the ones who stayed behind got under their desks. People in Miami, 440 miles from the epicenter, felt shaking. Miguel Charon was on the 13th floor of a building on Brickell Avenue. He told CNN he felt the walls shake for 30 to 40 seconds. His initial thought was that it must have been caused by a machine of some sort. He said building officials issued an evacuation order and people left the building in a smooth and calm manner. Jose Borrego, who also works in the Brickell area, said he was in a meeting. “We felt slight movement of the building, then we got told to evacuate the building,” he said. “Once we came outside (we) noticed that there are evacuations every building in the area.” The earthquake appears to have been a “strike-slip earthquake,” in which tectonic plates slide against each other. This limits the threat of a devastating tsunami, which are more associated with “thrust earthquakes,” where a portion of the earth is thrust upward and causes the water to push up and outward, creating the tsunami. The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake had a preliminary depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). The quake hit 125 kilometers (77.6 miles) north-northwest of Lucea in Jamaica. The earthquake also was felt as far away as Havana. Some people in the Cuban capital were evacuating taller buildings. Cuba’s state media reported the earthquake was felt across the island in Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, Holguín, Las Tunas, Cienfuegos, Pinar del Río, Havana and the Isle of Youth. There are no initial reports of damage or casualties.   Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     In Other News Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings."
Triad hit by 2.3 magnitude earthquake overnight,2020-01-28 15:42 UTC,https://myfox8.com/2020/01/28/triad-hit-by-2-3-magnitude-earthquake-overnight/,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       FOREST OAKS, N.C. — A 2.3 magnitude earthquake shook the Triad overnight, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.  Its epicenter was about 2.5 miles northwest of Forest Oaks and about 3.8 miles down. “I just heard a loud boom,” said Shawn Ijames, who lives off Wiley Lewis Road. “Usually because I stay right here at the interstate, you always can hear tractor-trailer trucks going up underneath because we only stay maybe 150 yards away, but it was super louder than that.” Ijames explained that he thought the shaking was caused by a fallen tree in his backyard. Other neighbors said they walked outside to check for debris in the middle of the night. Others felt more minor impacts. “(I) just felt a thump on the floor, so I went around the house to check and see if anything had fallen,” Bryce Mogck said. People reported the shaking up to five miles away on E. Florida St. in Greensboro. “My daughter, she jumped up and ran in the room. We both ran out at the same time, so I didn’t know if maybe someone had a wreck or something or maybe a fuse line or something like that. I wasn’t quite sure what happened,” Gwanda Roberts said. People living near the Martin Marietta Rock Quarry told FOX8 the shaking felt stronger than what they typically feel. Several people called 911 to report an explosion and their homes shaking. No damage was reported. More than 60 people told NCGS they felt the quake.

         A 5.0 magnitude earthquake hit southern Puerto Rico on Saturday at a shallow depth, raising concerns about unstable infrastructure in a region that has been hit by quakes every day for nearly a month. At least one small landslide was reported.   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake occurred at a depth of eight miles around the southern coastal town of Guayanilla, located close to the epicenters of most of the recent earthquakes.  ""We felt it really hard,"" town spokesman Danny Hernandez told The Associated Press, saying authorities were patrolling the area to investigate any potential damage. The newest quake comes a day after hundreds of people in the island's southern region were evacuated from earthquake shelters that flooded after heavy rains hit the U.S. territory. In the coastal city of Ponce alone, more than 350 people on Friday were moved back into a school that served as the initial shelter when the ground first began shaking, Angel Vazquez, the city's emergency management director, told the AP. He said no damage was immediately reported in Ponce, but that crews were out inspecting buildings in areas affected by a 6.4 magnitude quake that hit January 7, killing one person and damaging hundreds of homes. A 5.9 aftershock that hit the same area on January 11 caused further damage. The ground in southern Puerto Rico first began shaking on December 28, and while experts say several local faults are to blame, they are still analyzing data to determine why the earthquakes continue. U.S. President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for more than a dozen municipalities in Puerto Rico following earthquakes that officials say have caused more than $200 million in damage. More than 4,000 people remain in shelters, and officials expected that number to rise as a result of Saturday's quake.   Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved."
"At least 15 dead, more than 500 injured in Turkey earthquake",2020-01-25 00:11 UTC,https://fox43.com/2020/01/24/at-least-15-dead-more-than-500-injured-in-turkey-earthquake/,"At least 15 people have died and more than 500 were injured in eastern Turkey after an earthquake rattled the region on Friday evening, according to authorities. The 6.7-magnitude quake struck near the town of Sivrice, in eastern Elazig province, collapsing at least 10 buildings, Turkish Interior Minister Sulyman Soylu said. Soylu said 10 people were killed in Elazig province, while the other five were in Malatya province. Video from Turkey’s IHA Broadcasting Services shows emergency crews rescuing injured people from a collapsed building. Search and rescue operations were underway for 30 missing people in the Elazig city, Soylu said. Two of the injured are in critical condition, according to the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Preliminary reports say the earthquake lasted 40 seconds, AFAD said. Fifteen aftershocks have been felt in the wake, with the strongest registering at 5.4 magnitude, Soylu said. The quake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 10 km (6 miles), according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which enhances the shaking felt at the surface. About 500,000 people felt strong to very strong shaking, the USGS reported. The earthquake was felt in several other countries, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. According to the initial estimates from USGS, damage should be “relatively localized.” The quake interrupted a live broadcast of Edessa TV. Video of the broadcast shows four anchors talking while everything shakes around them. All relevant departments were taking measures to ensure the safety of citizens following the earthquake, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said early Saturday. Interior, health and environment ministers were sent to the quake-hit area.

Some Bay Area hospital buildings pose risk of earthquake collapse,2020-01-24 03:50 UTC,https://abc7news.com/some-bay-area-hospital-buildings-pose-risk-of-earthquake-collapse/5874314/,"WATCH LIVE An I-Team analysis of data from California's Office of Statewide Health, Planning and Development found 41 Bay Area hospital buildings that pose a significant risk of collapse and danger to the public in the event of an earthquake. SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Scientists say it is not a matter of if, but when a major earthquake strikes our region. When the big one hits, people will rely on hospitals to take care of the thousands who are expected to be injured but will they still be standing? The I-Team's Melanie Woodrow has been digging into state data. The Seismic Safety Act originally gave hospitals until 2008 to make their buildings safe in a major quake. Many hospitals applied for an extension until January 1st, 2020 and have now applied and been granted new extensions, even though they have a number of buildings that pose a risk of collapse. An I-TEAM analysis of data from California's Office of Statewide Health, Planning and Development found 41 Bay Area hospital buildings that pose a significant risk of collapse and danger to the public in the event of an earthquake.  For the last 12 years, more than 200 hospital facilities across the state have been working to upgrade their buildings to make them more structurally sound in the event of an earthquake. Santa Clara Valley Medical Center is one of several hospitals that applied for and was granted an extension beyond an already existing January 1, 2020 extension. According to the state, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center has five buildings that pose a significant risk of collapse and danger to the public in the event of an earthquake. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson tells the I-Team, the state granted an extension for three of the buildings until July 1, 2022. ""There are no acute care beds in these structures. Santa Clara Valley Medical Center has a permit in place and will begin to seismically retrofit these structures prior to the new deadline,"" wrote the spokesperson.  The statement also says the two other buildings have also been granted an extension to January 1, 2025. ""These structures include 16 patient beds and medical records, which will be moved to compliant buildings in 2021."" The other two hospitals with the most buildings that pose a significant risk of collapse are California Pacific Medical Center West Campus with seven buildings and Stanford Health Care with six buildings. CPMC tells the I-Team the hospital at the West Campus is now closed and all inpatient services have been transferred to the Van Ness Campus. Also that, ""There are some isolated support and outpatient care services still operating in the facility, which will relocate throughout 2020."" Stanford Health Care says there are no hospital beds or acute care in their six significant risk buildings. ""The affected outpatient services will be moved to a new space in Redwood City or on the main Palo Alto Campus by the end of 2023,"" writes a spokesperson.

         LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — A minor earthquake struck Granada Hills late Tuesday, rattling across Southern California.   The Los Angeles Fire Department immediately went into earthquake mode with a survey of the city by ground and air, but did not find any major infrastructure damage. There were also no reports of injuries. We are monitoring preliminary reports of a magnitude 3.6 #earthquake in the LA area. There are no reports of any damage and/or injuries to the LAPD at this time. Tuesday's earthquake comes just a few days after the 26th anniversary of the devastating Northridge earthquake, which is just about five miles south of Granada Hills. Social media naturally lit up with Angelenos asking who felt the earthquake and describing how it felt. Did anyone else feel that #earthquake I just felt that LA earthquake!7 miles from epicenter. Felt as if the house was hit by a giant bulldozer. But the weirdest part that always gets me is how LOUD it is. It sounded like something exoloded in my house!

Earthquake risk not just a west coast problem,2020-01-09 02:07 UTC,https://www.kgun9.com/news/national/earthquake-risk-not-just-a-west-coast-problem,"Menu  This week's series of earthquakes served as a reminder that the United States' earthquake risk extends far beyond the Pacific Coast.  On Tuesday, Puerto Rico was rocked by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake. The earthquake knocked out power to most of the island, killing at least one.  Also in recent days, minor earthquakes were felt in Tennessee and Texas.  While there have been dozens of earthquakes with a  4.5 magnitude or higher throughout the United States in recent years, the eastern United States see relatively fewer. Only four earthquakes of 4.5 magnitude or greater in the last four years have impacted the eastern United States.  But the issue is not the quantity of earthquakes in the eastern United States, but the impact.  The USGS puts out a hazard map that shows the earthquake risk nationwide. The map shows areas such as the Pacific Coast and parts of Alaska and Hawaii with a high risk of peak ground accelerations. It turns out that areas of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Illinois and South Carolina. USGS scientist David Schwartz agrees that the Pacific Northwest all the way to Charleston, S.C., practically every region of the United States, has a risk of feeling a devastating earthquake. ""The nature of the crust changes as you go from east to west. The Central and Eastern US, the crust is really old, it is older it is colder, it is denser, than the crust in the west which is younger,” Schwartz said. “It’s broken up by many faults and warmer. These different crusts transmit seismic waves differently.” And this difference in geology means that a strong earthquake in the Eastern United States could cause damage over an extensive area. Although the Eastern United States has not had many major earthquakes in the last century, two of the most powerful quakes in American history have happened east of the Rockies. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake that caused damage to the Washington Monument in 2011 is only a minor example of the kind of earthquakes the Eastern United States could see. In 1811 and 1812, a series of earthquakes struck the Mississippi River valley along the New Madrid fault. The strongest of the quakes was a possible magnitude 7.8. The quake was felt across much of the Eastern United States. In 1866, a magnitude 7.0 rattled Charleston, S.C. “A repeat of any of those earthquakes would be extremely damaging, because the housing stock in the Central and Eastern U.S. has not been designed for earthquakes,” Schwartz said. According to a survey funded by the U.S. Army, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake located along the New Madrid fault could cause 85,900 deaths and $298 billion in damage. By comparison, Hurricane Katrina caused roughly 1,500 deaths and $110 billion in damage. What to do during an earthquake  Report a typo"

Todays earthquake 6.4 no power in Puerto Rico, and little cell signal, sorry friends I can’t retweet . This is how the Church of Guayanilla was after the earthquake. #TemblorPR#EarthquakePRpic.twitter.com/fuoUQZtAhL  Over the past several weeks, hundreds of small earthquakes have occurred in the region, the USGS said. The seismic activity began with a magnitude 4.7 earthquake late on Dec. 28 and was followed by a magnitude 5.0 tremor just a few hours later. Since Dec. 28, the USGS said more than 400 magnitude 2+ earthquakes have occurred in the region. Some 10 of them registered stronger than magnitude 4, including Tuesday’s tremor. About 25 volunteers from the First Congregational Church of Hartland arrived in Puerto Rico on Sunday to help with relief efforts from the devastation of Hurricane Maria which left thousands dead in September 2017. All of them were reported safe and they had planned to continue working to renovate a church in San Juan but officials concerned about more earthquakes and whether the building remains structurally safe has paused all their efforts for now. “At this point, we are unclear about how the remainder of our week and work plans will unfold,” D’Anna said.  Seventh-day Adventist leaders in Puerto Rico are also struggling to understand the series of earthquakes that have been plaguing the island and the uncertainty that hangs over the lives of many affected by the disaster. “We have never as a country dealt with such earthquake in all my years,” Pastor Jose A. Rodríguez, president of the church in Puerto Rico, said in a field report from the SDA.  “There is so much uncertainty now, bridges are down, roads have collapsed, power hasn’t been restored and many are taking refuge in parks and arenas,” he said. He explained that at least six members of his church have lost their homes as a result of the earthquake and leaders in the South Puerto Rico Conference are still assessing the needs of members. Please pray for our partners in Puerto Rico. Everyone at the church is safe. We are working with our partners on a plan to help and will provide details when we have them. pic.twitter.com/GMzRYTFp5h Ponce Puerto Rico Stake President Franki Ruiz of the Latter-day Saints told Deseret News that he had expected a big quake due to frequent seismic activity on the island in the days before it hit. “I woke up and told my wife and parents and kids that this was the [big] one, so let’s get out of the house,” he said. “We walked calmly outside, and all my neighbors were also leaving their homes.”  Philadelphia City Councilmember Maria Quiñones-Sánchez, who was born in Puerto Rico,  told The Philadelphia Enquirer that while her relatives on the Island are safe, she and others are starting to plan how to help with relief efforts like they did in the wake of  Hurricane Maria. The local Latin American community joined with other groups, churches and synagogues to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, she said. “So many infrastructure problems still remain from past disasters,” she said. “The electric grid is still very fragile. A lot of things have been normalized; it’s not unusual to lose power or water. People are more nonchalant about it. That becomes oppressive day after day. It’s very sad.”  Was this article helpful?

A 6.4 magnitude earthquake hits Puerto Rico on a second day of strong temblors; at least 1 killed,2020-01-07 14:04 UTC,https://fox5sandiego.com/2020/01/07/a-6-4-magnitude-earthquake-hits-puerto-rico-on-a-second-day-of-strong-temblors-at-least-1-killed/,"FOX 5 San Diego Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       PONCE, Puerto Rico — A 6.4 magnitude earthquake and several other strong temblors struck Puerto Rico Tuesday morning, killing at least one man and injuring several others one day after a 5.8 magnitude quake shook the island, officials said. Power outages and damage have been reported near the island’s southern coast, including in the city of Ponce, where a 77-year-old man was killed and at least eight others were injured, Ponce emergency management director Angel Vasquez said Tuesday morning.   Riko Gonzalez and his parents were sleeping in their home in Yauco, near Indios, when the 6.4 quake struck. They awoke to a rumble and scurried out of the house. China and glasses were smashed on the kitchen floor, he said. It was “horrible, nothing compared to the (magnitude) 5s from yesterday,” Gonzalez told CNN. “People are afraid to go to bed, to then be woken up to worse earthquakes than the day before,” he said. In Guayanilla, just north of Indios, homes and a church were damaged, Mayor Nelson Torres said in a phone interview with CNN affiliate WAPA. Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority reported widespread outages across the island after its power plants activated an auto protective mechanism following the earthquake. Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced urged citizens to remain calm as the government responds to the most recent quake in a statement posted on Twitter. “I hope all are well. We are getting our information from @NMEADpr and @DSPnoticias,” the tweet said. “The entire government is active and in action. I ask our people to remain calm and urge you to remain safe.” The earthquakes come more than two years after Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory in September 2017. No tsunami is expected following Tuesday’s earthquakes, the US National Tsunami Warning Center said. The magnitude of Tuesday morning’s largest quake was adjusted slightly downward in the hours after it struck, after initially being recorded as a 6.6. Puerto Rico has experienced a flurry of earthquakes since December 28, according to data from the USGS, ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to Sunday’s 5.8. All the earthquakes appear to have been foreshocks to Tuesday morning’s largest quake, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. On Monday, the early morning quake in the same area caused some damage, including rock slides and a home collapse in Guayanilla, said Carlos Acevedo, Puerto Rico’s Emergency Management Agency director. This is a developing story and will be updated.

Please click here to learn how.  At least one person is dead after a 6.4-magnitude earthquake rocked Puerto Rico Tuesday morning, triggering an islandwide blackout and significant damage to buildings, including churches, in several of the hardest hit areas.  Over the past several weeks, hundreds of small earthquakes have occurred in the region, the USGS said. The seismic activity began with a magnitude 4.7 earthquake late on Dec. 28 and was followed by a magnitude 5.0 tremor just a few hours later. Since Dec. 28, the USGS said, more than 400 magnitude 2+ earthquakes have occurred in the region. Some 10 of them registered stronger than magnitude 4, including Tuesday’s tremor. Puerto Rico’s largest newspaper, El Nuevo Día, reported 73-year-old Nelson Martínez Guillén as the first casualty of the earthquake. A wall from his home in Ponce collapsed on him as he slept. ""There was a wall that divided the wall of the house above, he slept on one of those sides and in one of the movements the wall came off and fell on his back. He broke the bed and everything,"" Guillén’s brother-in-law, Reynaldo González, told El Nuevo Día. ""This was too strong, I didn't expect such a thing, but things happen and nobody knows why,"" he added. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, told The Wall Street Journal that a complete picture of the damage or injuries suffered is still unclear because communication for much of the island is down, but officials in Ponce have reported widespread damage.  “We expect that this will be the largest quake for now,” he said. “The aftershocks will continue for some time.”   The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority also confirmed that the earthquake triggered an islandwide blackout, but noted they would be working to restore power throughout the day. In a statement on Twitter, acting head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, said the federal government is in touch with officials on the island and “stands ready to assist” with the recovery. “I am monitoring the earthquake and after-shocks in Puerto Rico closely. @DHSgov stands ready to assist with assessments and recovery. @FEMA has been in touch with the governor and other PR officials and is responding appropriately,” he added. Multiple images and video of damage in the wake of the earthquake were shared online by many on Tuesday, including by former Speaker of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives Jaime Perelló.

No reports of residents feeling the earthquake  A 1.8 magnitude earthquake was reported in South Carolina Friday morning, according to the USGS.   The earthquake was reported just after midnight about 2 miles west of Cayce. It had a depth of 3.3 kilometers.  There are no reports of residents feeling the earthquake.  Since 1776 or perhaps even earlier, people living inland in North and South Carolina and in adjacent parts of Georgia and Tennessee have felt small earthquakes and suffered damage from infrequent larger ones. The largest earthquake in the area -- a magnitude 5.1 -- occurred in 1916. Moderately damaging earthquakes strike the inland Carolinas every few decades, and smaller earthquakes are felt about once each year or two.

Magnitude 6.3 earthquake hits Croatia; 5 deaths reported,2020-12-29 20:03 UTC,https://myfox8.com/news/magnitude-6-3-earthquake-hits-croatia-5-deaths-reported/,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — A strong earthquake hit central Croatia on Tuesday, destroying buildings and sending panicked people fleeing into rubble-covered streets in a town southeast of the capital. Authorities said five people were killed and at least 20 were injured. The European Mediterranean Seismological Center said a magnitude 6.3 quake hit 46 kilometers (28 miles) southeast of Zagreb. It caused widespread damage in the hardest-hit town of Petrinja. The same area was struck by a 5.2 quake on Monday. Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. Another four people were killed in villages near the town, according to the state HRT television. At least 20 people were hospitalized, two with serious injuries, officials said. “The center of Petrinja as it used to be no longer exists,” HRT reported, saying people remained inside collapsed buildings. “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT. “This is like Hiroshima – half of the city no longer exists.” Marica Pavlovic, a resident, said the quake felt “worse than a war.” “It was horrible, a shock, you don’t know what to do, whether to run out or hide somewhere,” she told The Associated Press. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable,” Plenkovic said. He said the army has 500 places ready in barracks to house people, while others will be accommodated in nearby hotels and other places. “No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” the prime minister said. Officials later toured a damaged hospital in the nearby town of Sisak, which was also badly hit by the earthquake. Plenkovic said the hospital’s patients will be evacuated in army helicopters and in ambulances. Health officials said a baby was delivered in a tent in front of the hospital in the aftermath of the earthquake. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that she spoke with Plenkovic and instructed an envoy to travel to Croatia as soon as possible. As a Mediterranean country, Croatia is prone to earthquakes, but not big ones. The last strong quake struck in the 1990s when the picturesque Adriatic coast village of Ston was destroyed. Regional TV channel N1 reported from Petrinja that a collapsed building had fallen on a car. The footage showed firefighters trying to remove the debris. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the car and carried into an ambulance. Fallen bricks and dust littered the streets as emergency teams used rescue dogs while looking for survivors in the rubble. A woman was found alive some four hours after the earthquake, rescuers said. The Croatian military was deployed in Petrinja to help with the rescue operation. Croatian seismologist Kresimir Kuk described the earthquake as “extremely strong,” far stronger than another one that hit Zagreb and nearby areas in the spring. He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky old buildings and move to newer areas of the city because of aftershocks. In the capital, people ran into the streets in fear. The earthquake was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia and Slovenia. It was felt as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported. Authorities in Slovenia said the Krsko nuclear power plant was temporarily shut down following the earthquake. The power plant is jointly owned by Slovenia and Croatia and located near their border.

"LADWP replacing 7,000 miles of water pipes with earthquake resilient ones",2020-12-02 09:22 UTC,https://abc7.com/ladwp-installing-earthquake-resilient-pipes/8426107/,"WATCH LIVE LADWP is replacing critical areas along its 7,000 miles of water pipeline with earthquake resilient ones ones to help keep the water flowing after a big one hits. LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Local utilities are looking for new ways to make Southern California earthquake safe, and one way is by replacing aging water pipes. The new pipes could help keep the water flowing after a big one hits. LADWP is replacing critical areas along its 7,000 miles of water pipes in Los Angeles with earthquake resilient pipes to ensure water is still flowing after the shaking stops. ""We live in earthquake country. The Northridge earthquake is another reminder for us to make sure that we develop an infrastructure that is resilient where we can bounce back and provide reliable water supplies to our customers after a large earthquake event,"" said Alvin Bautista of LADWP. RELATED | How to make your own earthquake kit  LADWP joined Japan's earthquake resilient pipe network in 2013, making L.A. the United States' first public utility system to use the earthquake resilient pipe. It involves a stronger steel pipe coating and a joint that doesn't crack during shaking. ""Our regular pipe does not have this type of freedom of movement, so the material that we use has it, so it will allow for a certain amount of expansion and contraction, it also gives it a degree of freedom where it can rotate along the axis there so that it doesn't break with excessive movement underground,"" said Bautista. LADWP's long-term replacement plan will take years to complete; targeted locations in critical earthquake hazard zones were first to receive the earthquake resilient pipe. ""Areas where we need reliable water supply such as hospitals, command and control centers, shelters, areas where people will gather after a large earthquake event, those areas need to be reliable with the water supply, that's our focus,"" said Bautista. Drivers around L.A. will notice construction zones where crews are installing the earthquake resilient pipe. After the replacement is done and the traffic inconvenience is over, L.A. will have the sturdiest water pipes in America.

         BOSTON (CBS) – Sunday's earthquake that shook much of southern New England didn't cause significant damage. But it was still a rare occurrence for the region. Homes from Cape Cod all the way to Long Island felt the magnitude 3.6 earthquake that originated in Buzzard's Bay. WBZ-TV meteorologist Zack Green said that while it's not uncommon for an earthquake to rumble in New England, this was the first one of this magnitude since the 1970s. Several dozen residents in New Bedford reported minor damage to their homes, most in basements where chimneys cracked. New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell said residents should check their chimneys and basement and report any damage to the fire department. ""First of all it's crazy that we had an earthquake. It's not what you'd expect. We expect other natural disasters to occur from time to time but earthquakes are not one of them,"" Mitchell said, adding there have been previous instances along the same fault line in Buzzard's Bay. ""This is probably not the last one we're going to get. Who knows when the next one will be?""   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

         BOSTON (CBS/AP) — The strongest earthquake to hit southern New England in decades rattled homes and nerves Sunday morning, but didn't cause any significant damage, authorities said. The 3.6 magnitude earthquake centered off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts, in Buzzards Bay struck just after 9 a.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. The earthquake hit at a depth of a little more than 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) and was felt across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and into Connecticut and Long Island, New York. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a magnitude 3.5 temblor hit in March 1976, said Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist. About 14,000 people went to the agency's website to report the earthquake, including people from Easthampton, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut, both about 100 miles (160 kilometers) away, and several from more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) away in Boston, he said. That's not unusual in New England. ""It's common for them to be felt very far away because the rock here is old and continuous and transmits the energy a long way,"" Caruso said. Ali Kenner Brodsky, who lives in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, not far from the epicenter, was sitting in her kitchen talking with her son, when it hit. ""It was a rumbling. It sounded like something exploded. It rumbled. The whole house shook,"" she said. She said it lasted around 10 to 15 seconds. ""In that moment, it feels like it's going on forever."" Her husband, Sam, ran to the basement because he thought the boiler blew up. Sarah Trainor was lying in bed in Plymouth at the time. She was immediately concerned about her furnace. ""It was probably about less than 10 seconds, pretty short,"" she said. ""I think it felt longer because mentally you're like 'what is happening right now.""   Magnitude 3.6 earthquakes rarely cause major damage, Caruso said. Chris Besse, a spokesman for the oMassachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said it had not received any reports of significant damage. There were some reports of minor damage. New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell reported that the earthquake caused damage to at least two homes in the city's South End. The fire department is inspecting basements and the Red Cross is helping impacted residents. The quake appears to have caused damage like this to at least two houses in the South End. The fire dept is inspecting nearby basements, and the @RedCross is helping with sheltering the occupants. pic.twitter.com/wjCPhSgA4H ""I encourage everyone to check their chimneys for damage, especially in the basement. If you find damage, please call the fire department. You should also make sure your carbon monoxide detector is working,"" Mitchell tweeted. Police in Fall River tweeted that they received numerous phone calls about the quake, including reports of items falling off of shelves, and street signs getting uprooted.

Rescuers have pulled more than 100 earthquake survivors from the rubble of Izmir,2020-10-31 19:02 UTC,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/31/europe/earthquake-turkey-greece-aegean-sea-rescue-scli-intl/index.html,"
      Rescue efforts continued apace in the western Turkish city of Izmir on Saturday, a day after a powerful earthquake hit the Aegean Sea, causing buildings to come crashing down and claiming the lives of at least 39 people.
   
      Thirty-seven of the deaths were in Turkey, authorities there said, and two were in Greece. At least 885 people were injured in Turkey.
   
      A total of 20 buildings were seriously damaged in Izmir by the tremor Friday afternoon, according to Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer, the majority of them in the middle-class Bayrakli district.
   
      Search-and-rescue operations remained underway in nine buildings as of Saturday afternoon, while operations have been completed in eight other buildings, Turkey’s disaster agency said.
   
      Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saturday that 103 people have been rescued from the quake’s rubble.
   
      Overnight, tens of people gathered anxiously around each collapsed building, huddling under blankets in the bitter cold as search-and-rescue teams worked to locate those trapped. The rumble of heavy construction machinery filled the air, punctuated by bursts of crying and shouting.
   
      Much of the activity was focused on the large Riza building, which housed businesses and apartments on its eight floors.
   
      One survivor, 28-year-old Buse Hasyilmaz, was pulled alive from the rubble there at about midnight, several hours after the building collapsed. 
   
      Hasyilmaz, who was at a dental practice in the building with her parents when the earthquake hit, was able to talk to rescue teams and a Turkish minister on the phone while they were trying to reach her. 
   
      In a video from the scene, she told them “unleash the dogs. I will make a cat sound,” in an effort to attract the rescue dogs’ attention. 
   
      The minister responded that this was a good idea, adding: “I want you to remain calm like this. Keep your spirits up and be patient.”
   
      Hasyilmaz’s father was also rescued safely. It wasn’t immediately clear whether her mother had been located.
    
      Hours later, workers reached and rescued 16-year-old Inci in the same building. 
   
      “I’ll come and listen to you play the violin,” a female rescue worker promises the teenager, seen in another video. Her legs are trapped, she can’t feel them. She’s pinned down by a block of cement. 
   
      “I hurt a lot,” Inci says, pleading with the rescue worker to hold her hand. For nearly a full day she’s been alone, in pain and terrified.
   
      “You look like your mother. She’s fine, she’s waiting for you,” the rescue worker tells her. 
   
      As the search teams work to clear buckets of rubble, hauling away concrete beams, they call out for quiet. An eerie silence descends on the crowds.
   
      This is just one of many videos showing the incredible efforts of the teams searching through the aftermath of the quake. 
   
      In another collapsed building a mother and her four children were all pulled out alive, 23 hours after the tremors. One of them later died, the Turkish health minister said. 
   
      A young woman whose husband was trapped under the rubble at his mother’s house, where he had been working while his mother was away, hoped for good news on Saturday morning.
   
      Rescue teams had told her that thermal cameras showed a man moving, she told CNN. She was praying that her husband would be safely reunited with their two children, aged seven and 10.
   
      A nurse, who asked not to be named, said her colleague was under the rubble in Bayrakli with her two nephews. She told CNN that she was confident her colleague’s professional skills would help all three to survive.
   
      The United States Geological Survey (USGS) measured the tremor’s magnitude at 7.0, while Turkish authorities said it was 6.6. The quake struck 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) northeast of the town of Néon Karlovásion on Samos, the USGS reported, at 1:51 pm Greek time (7:51 a.m. ET).
   
      It hit at a relatively shallow depth of 21 kilometers (13 miles), the USGS reported, making its impact powerfully felt at ground level around the epicenter.
   
      There have been 615 aftershocks so far, of which more than 40 were over 4.0 magnitude, the Turkish disaster agency said Saturday. 
   
      Greek authorities said two teenagers, a boy and a girl, died on the Greek island of Samos after a wall collapsed on them. 
   
      The earthquake triggered what authorities have called a “mini tsunami.”
   
      TV footage showed water flooding through the streets of Cesme and Seferihisar in parts of Turkey’s wider Izmir province, as well as on Samos. No tsunami warnings were issued.
   
      Idil Gungor, who works as a journalist and runs a guesthouse in the Turkish town of Siğacik in Izmir province, said Friday that the area was damaged more by the force of the water than the quake itself.
   
      Her guesthouse, in a 100-year-old building, had been inundated and fish were swimming inside it, she said. Shops in town had also been flooded and their goods damaged.
   
      Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Friday on Twitter that he had spoken to his Turkish counterpart and offered his condolences. Tensions between the two nations have flared recently over energy claims in the eastern Mediterranean.  
   
      “Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,” Mitsotakis wrote.
   
In a tweet, the Turkish president offered his condolences to Greece and said “that two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life.”
   
      According to Erdogan, both Turkey and Greece were ready to send aid to the other.
   
      French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said on Twitter his country had also offered to send assistance to Turkey and Greece.

Strong Aegean Sea earthquake topples buildings in Turkey,2020-10-30 13:19 UTC,https://www.wmtw.com/article/strong-aegean-sea-earthquake-topples-buildings-in-turkey/34531913,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. Rescue workers extricated a 70-year-old man from a collapsed building in western Turkey on Sunday, some 34 hours after a strong earthquake in the Aegean Sea struck Turkey and Greece, killing at least 64 people and injuring more than 900. It was the latest series of remarkable rescues after the Friday afternoon earthquake, which was centered in the Aegean northeast of the Greek island of Samos. Search-and-rescue teams were working in nine toppled or damaged buildings in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, but appeared to be finding more bodies Sunday than survivors. Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) raised the death toll Sunday in Izmir to 62. Two teenagers were killed Friday on Samos and at least 19 others were injured. There was some debate over the magnitude of the earthquake. The U.S. Geological Survey rated it 7.0, while the Istanbul's Kandilli Institute put it at 6.9 and AFAD said it measured 6.6.  The quake triggered a small tsunami that hit Samos and the Seferihisar district of Izmir, drowning one elderly woman. The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Hundreds of aftershocks followed. Turkey’s disaster agency said 940 people were injured in Turkey alone, with more than 218 still receiving treatment. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said 26 badly damaged buildings would be demolished in Izmir. “It’s not the earthquake that kills but buildings,” he added, repeating a common slogan. Turkey has a mix of older buildings and cheap or illegal construction, which can lead to serious damage and deaths when earthquakes hit. Regulations have been tightened in light of earthquakes to strengthen or demolish buildings and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities but it is not happening fast enough. Two destroyed apartment buildings in Izmir where much of the rescues are taking place had received reports of “decay” in 2012 and 2018, according to the municipal agency in charge of such certificates. Turkish media including the Hurriyet newspaper said one of the buildings, which was built in 1993, was at risk of earthquake damage because of its low quality concrete and the lack of reinforcements. However, the building continued to be occupied. A 73-year-old survivor from one of those buildings said she was on her third floor balcony when the quake struck and believes there were at least 50 people in the building, which also had a cafe on the bottom floor. “In the first tremor nothing happened. During the second tremor, the seventh floor, sixth and fourth floors fell on top of another like a sandwich,” Suzan Dere said. “The building collapsed in a cloud of dust onto the street with a very loud noise. It all happened within one minute.” Turkey's justice minister said prosecutors have begun investigating several collapsed buildings and promised legal repercussions if experts identified neglect. AFAD said nearly 6,400 personnel had been activated for rescue work and hundreds of others for food distribution, emergency help and building damage control. Turkey is criss-crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece as well. In a rare show of unity amid months of tense relations over energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity over the quake toll. Pope Francis on Sunday asked the faithful to pray for the people of the Aegean Sea. The quake occurred as Turkey was already struggling with an economic downturn and the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Turkey has more than 10,000 confirmed virus deaths but some experts have accused the government of concealing the true impact of the virus with the way it counts new cases.

Strong Aegean Sea earthquake topples buildings in Turkey,2020-10-30 13:19 UTC,https://www.wxii12.com/article/strong-aegean-sea-earthquake-topples-buildings-in-turkey/34531913,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. Rescue workers extricated a 70-year-old man from a collapsed building in western Turkey on Sunday, some 34 hours after a strong earthquake in the Aegean Sea struck Turkey and Greece, killing at least 64 people and injuring more than 900. It was the latest series of remarkable rescues after the Friday afternoon earthquake, which was centered in the Aegean northeast of the Greek island of Samos. Search-and-rescue teams were working in nine toppled or damaged buildings in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, but appeared to be finding more bodies Sunday than survivors. Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) raised the death toll Sunday in Izmir to 62. Two teenagers were killed Friday on Samos and at least 19 others were injured. There was some debate over the magnitude of the earthquake. The U.S. Geological Survey rated it 7.0, while the Istanbul's Kandilli Institute put it at 6.9 and AFAD said it measured 6.6.  The quake triggered a small tsunami that hit Samos and the Seferihisar district of Izmir, drowning one elderly woman. The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Hundreds of aftershocks followed. Turkey’s disaster agency said 940 people were injured in Turkey alone, with more than 218 still receiving treatment. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said 26 badly damaged buildings would be demolished in Izmir. “It’s not the earthquake that kills but buildings,” he added, repeating a common slogan. Turkey has a mix of older buildings and cheap or illegal construction, which can lead to serious damage and deaths when earthquakes hit. Regulations have been tightened in light of earthquakes to strengthen or demolish buildings and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities but it is not happening fast enough. Two destroyed apartment buildings in Izmir where much of the rescues are taking place had received reports of “decay” in 2012 and 2018, according to the municipal agency in charge of such certificates. Turkish media including the Hurriyet newspaper said one of the buildings, which was built in 1993, was at risk of earthquake damage because of its low quality concrete and the lack of reinforcements. However, the building continued to be occupied. A 73-year-old survivor from one of those buildings said she was on her third floor balcony when the quake struck and believes there were at least 50 people in the building, which also had a cafe on the bottom floor. “In the first tremor nothing happened. During the second tremor, the seventh floor, sixth and fourth floors fell on top of another like a sandwich,” Suzan Dere said. “The building collapsed in a cloud of dust onto the street with a very loud noise. It all happened within one minute.” Turkey's justice minister said prosecutors have begun investigating several collapsed buildings and promised legal repercussions if experts identified neglect. AFAD said nearly 6,400 personnel had been activated for rescue work and hundreds of others for food distribution, emergency help and building damage control. Turkey is criss-crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece as well. In a rare show of unity amid months of tense relations over energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity over the quake toll.

Several buildings were wrecked in Turkey's western Izmir province, according to officials. ISTANBUL -- A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 14 people and injuring over 500 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 12 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, including one who drowned, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said 522 people were injured, with five undergoing surgery and eight in intensive care.  On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying ""Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children."" At least 19 people were injured in Samos, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul's governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey's largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter - roughly 10 kilometers - potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 2,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens. France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France's ""full solidarity with Greece and Turkey"" and said ""we are ready to offer the necessary aid."" The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. ""We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,"" Turkey's Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. ""This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We're ready to help if Greece needs it."" Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, tweeted that he had phoned Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ""to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together."" Erdogan responded to the tweet with his thanks and offered his condolences. ""Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,"" he wrote. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and NATO allies.

Earthquake swarm: Series of temblors could continue to rattle Salton Sea area for several days,2020-10-01 20:28 UTC,https://abc7.com/weather/earthquake-swarm-expected-to-continue-to-rattle-salton-sea-area/6698345/,"WATCH LIVE The USGS said during this earthquake swarm, the probability of larger earthquakes in that area is significantly greater than usual. An earthquake swarm continued Thursday in desert communities near the Salton Sea, which has a history of such seismic activity, and the series of temblors could continue for several days. WESTMORLAND, Calif. (KABC) -- An earthquake swarm continued Thursday in desert communities near the Salton Sea, which has a history of such seismic activity, and the series of temblors could continue for several days. The hundreds of earthquakes included a magnitude-4.9 tremor Wednesday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were 28 quakes alone from 11 p.m. Wednesday through 10 a.m. Thursday ranging in magnitudes of 2.5 to 3.6.   The swarm is centered beneath agricultural fields south of the Salton Sea, about 2.5 miles northeast of the small town of Westmorland. ""When you have a lot of earthquakes, you tend to have a lot of earthquakes,"" seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said. ""But it doesn't make it more likely for it to trigger somewhere else. This doesn't make us worry about the San Andreas fault; its too far away."" However, the shaking was also felt in San Diego and Riverside counties, but so far there are no reports of major damage there Dr. Jones says the zone is a common source of swarms, and this is one of the largest ever. Notable past seismic activity in the region includes a 1981 swarm that included a magnitude 5.8 quake and a 2012 swarm that produced a magnitude 5.4 quake, the USGS said in a statement.   Past swarms have remained active for up to 20 days, but the average is about a week, the USGS said. The USGS said during this earthquake swarm, the probability of larger earthquakes in that area is significantly greater than usual. The state on Thursday coincidentally launched a ""Don't Get Caught Off Guard"" campaign to raise awareness of California's earthquake warning system which detects the start of a quake and sends alerts so that people can protect themselves before shaking arrives. The annual Great California ShakeOut, in which millions of people practice the ""drop, cover, hold on"" response to earthquakes, is scheduled for Oct. 15.

Google has just developed a new feature for Android which can send alerts of an imminent earthquake and even use your phone as a tiny seismometer, along with millions of others, to create the world’s largest earthquake detection network. That’s just been revealed in the latest Google blog post and it’s pretty cool. The first part of the news has seen Google collaborate with the US Geological Survey and California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services so that earthquake alerts are sent directly to Android devices. In this first stage, this will apply in California only. Early earthquake warnings could save precious seconds with Google's new Android phone feature.  That’s pretty cool, but Google is going further. As it points out, that widespread seismometer network is not universally available around the world, so it’s making use of a really small doohickey, the accelerometer found in your smartphone, to create the world’s largest earthquake detection network.  It's an exciting technology which is expected in the coming year to reach way beyond California. In the meantime, after an earthquake, if you use your Android phone to search for “Earthquake” or “Earthquake near me”, Google will offer relevant results.  "
Bible passage at Catholic Mass coincides with North Carolina earthquake,2020-08-11 14:59 UTC,https://www.wxii12.com/article/north-carolina-earthquake-bible-catholic-mass-charlotte/33574237,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. The Scripture quite literally came to life for several Catholic churches in North Carolina as a rare earthquake rattled portions of the state over the weekend. According to a news release from the Diocese of Charlotte, Father Richard Sutter of St. Gabriel’s Catholic Church said the lector in the Sunday service had just reached the 19th chapter of 1 Kings, a Bible passage referring to the prophet Elijah, which said, “After the wind there was an earthquake — but the LORD was not in the earthquake.”  It was then that parishioners felt the 5.1 magnitude earthquake centered near Sparta, the most powerful to hit the state in more than 100 years.  Images on social media also showed items knocked off of grocery store shelves. The Charlotte Observer reported that while he didn’t feel it himself, Sutter said parishioners came up to him as soon as the service ended. He said the moment can be a lesson for the times. “When there’s fear from an earthquake, when there’s fear from a storm, when there’s fear from a pandemic and uncertainty ... you have to let the Lord speak to us the truth,” he said. “Let’s keep our eyes on Jesus Christ and not the waves (or even earthquakes) we cannot control,” he said. Father Cory Catron, pastor of the Catholic mission in Sparta, said his church suffered no apparent damage from the quake. “Made for good homily material, though,” the news release said. In his homily, Catron joked about being worried the next thing would be fire. He called the events a reminder of God’s presence, adding “we must not be distracted by the noise and problems of the world around us, but listen for His voice in the stillness.”  He said, “The ceiling creaked for like three seconds, and everybody kind of looked up and immediately we knew what it was.”  Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites."

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is in Sparta Tuesday afternoon to survey damage to businesses and homes   from the historic, 5.1 magnitude earthquake that hit on Sunday.  Cooper met with homeowners, along with local and county officials to view damage. Sunday's quake is the powerful one to hit North Carolina in more than 100 years. It shook much of the state early Sunday, rattling homes, businesses and residents.  “We’ve dealt with a hurricane a tornado and now a violent earthquake all in the middle of a pandemic,"" said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper.  “It looks like somebody when threw and trashed this house. Everything is off the wall. All the cabinets have emptied into the floor,” said Steve Severt whose wife's aunts house was damaged in Sparta. And while there were very few injuries, people said they are hoping for some kind of relief from the state or the federal government to help many people in the area who do not have earthquake insurance. “I’m hoping that we can find some kind of program that can come in and help the citizens of the area,” said homeowner Mike Parlier. Mike Sprayberry, the NC Emergency Management Director said he believes help, may not be far behind. “When we here that there’s damages to up to 200 structures and then 15 homes that are completely uninhabitable we do think there is a good chance that we could find a program that we could implement in the county,” said Sprayberry. As the community of Sparta continues to asses the damage and cleanup. The Sheriff of Alleghany County is asking folks who have damage to report to the Sheriff’s Office. They are also putting together a list of volunteers to help with the cleanup. There were no reports of serious injuries, but some minor structural damage was reported in Sparta, as well as cracks in roads. Images on social media also showed items knocked off of grocery store shelves. The U.S. Geological Survey said on its website that there are chances for one or more aftershocks in the next week, forecasting a 45% chance for earthquakes of magnitude 3 or greater.  The chances of another quake as strong as the one on Sunday or greater was about 1%, the geological survey said.

Deadly Earthquake Strikes Southwest China,2020-05-19 05:26 UTC,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/deadly-earthquake-strikes-southwest-china,"

 At least four people are dead and 23 others injured after a strong earthquake struck southwest China late Monday.  Geologists at the China Earthquake Networks Center said a 5.0-magnitude earthquake struck in Qiaojia county in Yunnan province.  China is prone to earthquakes, especially in its mountainous western and southwestern regions. One of the worst disasters of its kind occurred in 2008, when nearly 90,000 were killed when a strong earthquake struck Sichuan province.  "
Tonopah earthquake raises questions of seismic safety in Las Vegas valley,2020-05-16 00:34 UTC,https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/tonopah-earthquake-raises-questions-of-seismic-safety-in-las-vegas-valley/,"KLAS Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — The 6.5-magnitude Tonopah earthquake was felt by many here in southern Nevada. It’s now raising questions if a similar-sized quake could rock the valley anytime soon. No damage has been reported in Las Vegas, but many people across southern Nevada felt the quake. There are about a half dozen active faults across the valley, including along Decatur Boulevard. You can tell that the ground is uneven in the area. Below is a map of some of the other fault lines. Nevada is the nation’s third-most seismically active state, behind only California and Alaska. Friday morning’s earthquake outside Tonopah is the largest in the region since another 6.8 magnitude quake nearly 70 years ago, in 1954. That’s according to the Nevada Division of Emergency Management. The last major quake with the epicenter in Nevada was a 6.0 magnitude quake in the small town of Wells in 2008. Experts anticipate that a 6.0 to 6.5-magnitude earthquake could happen in the Las Vegas valley. They say we need to be prepared. “I think it can be considered an indicator that we need to be prepared for earthquakes in our region,” said Wanda Taylor, UNLV Geoscience Professor. “That it’s not in a too populated area, it caused some damage to the highway and things like that, but had it been right under a town or something, it could have caused a lot more damage.” One woman in Pahrump says she was taken by surprise. “I was having a really good dream and then all of a sudden, my bed started shaking, and it was going back and forth, back and forth,” said Barbara Cates. “I was getting scared. I didn’t know what it was and I woke up and it was still moving.” Experts say an earthquake in Las Vegas could cause damage to infrastructure, but they point out that building codes in Clark County have been updated to increase seismic safety. In terms of how to prepare, you can bolt taller furniture to the ground and also have a three-day supply of things like water and medication. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Officials: Small earthquake reported in South Carolina,2020-04-07 17:19 UTC,https://www.wjcl.com/article/officials-small-earthquake-reported-in-south-carolina/32068884,"Earthquake reported in Lesslie, South Carolina Earthquake reported in Lesslie, South Carolina The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. Earthquake reported in Lesslie, South Carolina  A small earthquake was reported Monday in South Carolina, according to the  United States Geological Survey.  The 2.3 magnitude earthquake was reported about 3 p.m. in Lesslie, South Carolina which is about 9 miles from Rock Hill.  There are no reports of any damage.  Since 1776 or perhaps even earlier, people living inland in North and South Carolina and in adjacent parts of Georgia and Tennessee have felt small earthquakes and suffered damage from infrequent larger ones. The largest earthquake in the area -- a magnitude 5.1 -- occurred in 1916. Moderately damaging earthquakes strike the inland Carolinas every few decades, and smaller earthquakes are felt about once each year or two.

The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke’s Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn’t interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho’s coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation’s highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. “It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said. The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.” Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it. “I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I’m sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.” Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay. That quake was along what scientists call a “normal fault,” with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday’s quake appeared to be on an unmapped “strike-slip fault,” causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line. “This is one that wasn’t obvious enough to be mapped before now,” Jones said. Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they’re less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists. Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake. “An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn’t surprise us,” she said. “They do every bit as much damage.” People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said. “Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,” Jones said. “Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake. Just get down and try to cover.” Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

There were no immediate reports of injuries, but residents on social media in several cities reported feeling the shaking. The USGS says the epicenter of the quake was nearly 45 miles west of the town of Challis and near Beaver Creek along the Salmon River Mountains. “Yep we felt it too. No reports of damage at this time,” Boise Police Department tweeted. “Stay safe out there Boise. Call us if you need us.” Shortly after in the same area, a 4.6 magnitude earthquake aftershock was reported, according to the National Weather Service. “We have not received any reports of injury or significant damage,” Valley County Sheriff’s Office posted on Facebook. “We suggest you check your propane tanks!!” The largest and most damaging earthquake in Idaho history occurred in 1983 when a magnitude 6.9 earthquake rocked the town of Challis, according to the Idaho Office of Emergency Management. Two schoolchildren died when they were buried under the rubble of a collapsed building. The quake caused about $12.5 million in property damage.

 A strong earthquake shook Croatia and its capital Sunday, causing widespread damage and panic. One death as been reported.  One person was reported killed in Zagreb. A 15-year-old was found in a collapsed building, according to the head of Zagreb Emergency Medicine Institute. Many buildings cracked in Zagreb and walls and rooftops were damaged. Downtown streets were littered with debris. Concrete slabs fell on cars and chimneys landed in front of entrances. Inside homes, residents shared photos of belongings falling off shelves, broken bottles and glass. Officials said there were injuries, but gave no other immediate details.  The earthquake struck amid a partial lockdown of the capital because of the spread of the coronavirus. People were told to avoid public areas, such as parks and public squares, but had no choice as they ran out of their apartments.  Up to five people keeping a safe social distance are allowed to be together.  Zagreb’s iconic cathedral was also damaged with the top of one of its two spires collapsing. The cathedral was rebuilt after it toppled in the 1880 earthquake. Power was cut as people ran out of their homes. Several fires were also reported. At least two other tremors were recorded later. "

5.8 Magnitude Earthquake Strikes Off Coast of Northern California,2020-03-09 11:33 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/5-8-magnitude-earthquake-strikes-off-coast-of-northern-california_3265072.html,"A 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Northern California on the evening of March 8, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said.  The agency initially reported the earthquake as having a magnitude of 5.9, but it was later downgraded. The quake could be felt in nearby coastal cities, according to reports. San Francisco, Marin County, and parts of the East Bay reported light to moderate shaking, according to ABC 7. In the hours following the preliminary quake, the USGS recorded a total of five aftershocks near the epicenter, with magnitudes of 2.5, 2.9, 2.5, 4.9, and 2.5 respectively, the most recent of which had a depth of 0.3 kilometers (o.18 miles), and struck 59 kilometers (37 miles) west-northwest of Petrolia. The USGS forecast a chance of smaller aftershocks could continue to occur over the next week near the epicenter, and has advised people to be wary when in or around vulnerable structures, such as unreinforced masonry buildings. There are likely to be up to six magnitude 3 or higher aftershocks, the USGS said. There are no reports of damage so far and the National Tsunami Warning Center has not said a tsunami is expected. California is typically struck by two or three earthquakes with a magnitude of 5.5 and higher every year, according to the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC). Last July, California was hit by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake—the region’s most powerful quake in nearly two decades. California in October rolled out the nation’s first statewide earthquake warning system, designed to detect seismic waves and alert residents through a mobile phone app even before the ground starts shaking. Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said a Silicon Valley reservoir must be drained because its dam could break during a major earthquake and flood numerous towns and cities in the San Francisco Bay area. The FERC said the lake has to be drained by Oct. 1, saying the risk posed by the dam on the Anderson River in Santa Clara County is too great. “It is unacceptable to maintain the reservoir at an elevation higher than necessary when it can be reduced, thereby decreasing the risk to public safety and the large population downstream of Anderson Dam,” wrote David Capka, the head of FERC’s Division of Dam Safety and Inspections, in a letter to the agency that manages the dam, the Santa Clara Valley Water District. The dam, which was built in 1950, is located between San Jose and Morgan Hill, and it can hold 89,073 acre-feet of water. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, it holds more than half what the district has stored. Capka said the reservoir must be drained “as quickly as you can” and the dam must be fixed before the winter of 2021 and 2022. Local officials agreed that the dam needs to be retrofitted but she said that draining the reservoir could result in unintended consequences. “Valley Water agrees with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that it is vital we reduce the dam safety risk and move as quickly as possible with the Anderson Dam Seismic Retrofit Project,” Valley Water CEO Norma Camacho said in a statement. However, Camacho added, “The demand to empty Anderson Reservoir could result in unsafe consequences.” Camacho said draining the reservoir might cause fish die-offs and significantly impact sensitive native fish, amphibians, reptiles, wetlands, and other habitats. Water supplies would be strained, and the district would have to find another source outside the county especially if there’s another drought, she added.

Earthquake preparedness: California program grants funds to retrofit older homes,2020-02-22 03:27 UTC,https://abc7news.com/science/earthquake-preparedness-ca-program-grants-funds-to-retrofit-older-homes/5956792/,"WATCH LIVE Earthquake Brace and Bolt is a California run grant program to retrofit older homes in case of earthquakes, providing up to $3,000 in funding. SAN JOSE, Calif.  (KGO) -- ""Too good to be true. Perfect timing. It's something I've been wanting to do for years."" That's what San Jose homeowner Leo Hartung thinks about the state's Earthquake Brace + Bolt (EBB) program, which started accepting applications this week for its 2020 grant program. Owners of older homes, typically built before 1980, are eligible to receive grants up to $3,000 to cover the cost of retrofits to prevent their homes from being knocked off the foundation during an earthquake. A typical retrofit in the Bay Area can cost from $5,000 to $7,500. $13.2 million is available this year from a FEMA grant. It's estimated that there are 1.2 million vulnerable homes in California. Retrofit work has to be done by a contractor certified for the program by the state within six months of approval.  Hartung's contractor, Christopher Scola of Construction CMS in San Jose, showed us a typical half-inch bolt that was used in the 50s or 60s with a tiny washer and a little nut to secure a house to the foundation. Scola said today the code requires ""a much bigger bolt, 5/8 inch thick with a much bigger washer, and the spacing is now three to four feet apart whereas in the 60s they would be six feet apart, if that."" The work typically takes a couple of days. The goal is to retrofit 4,400 homes this year. Since the first grants were awarded in 2014, about 10,000 California homes have been retrofitted under the program. ""I have the cripple wall, which is the area between the foundation and the floor that we had to add plywood to that, and most homes don't have cripple walls,"" Hartung said. ""So that was just one day doing all the plywood. And then the next day then they did all the brackets.""  Word of mouth is a big part of this program. While we were at Hartung's Almaden Valley home, one of his neighbors called to find out why a camera crew was there. He told them about the program, and now that neighbor is interested in applying for the Earthquake Brace+Bolt program. To find out if you live in one of the 355 high-hazard ZIP codes eligible to apply, you can go to their website. There is also a database of FEMA-trained licensed contractors certified for the program, searchable by zip code.  See more stories and videos about Building a Better Bay Area here.

Earthquake Shakes Klauea's South Flank,2020-02-03 18:33 UTC,https://bigislandnow.com/2020/02/03/earthquake-shakes-kilaueas-south-flank/,"Privacy Policy | About Our Ads A magnitude-4.2 earthquake rattled the south flank of Kīlauea Volcano Sunday night, the 20th time in 20 years a quake of a magnitude-4.0 or higher struck the area, according to the US Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO).   The earthquake was centered about 7.5 miles southeast of Kīlauea caldera near the Hōlei Pali area of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park at a depth of 4.8 miles. A map showing its location is posted on the HVO website. More details are available at the National Earthquake Information Center website. Weak to light shaking, with maximum Intensity of III, has been reported across the Island of Hawai‘i.  At that intensity, significant damage to buildings or structures is not expected. The USGS “Did you feel it?” service received over 280 felt reports within the first hour of the earthquake. According to HVO seismologist Brian Shiro, the earthquake had no apparent effect on Kīlauea or Mauna Loa volcanoes.  “We see no detectable changes in activity at the summits or along the rift zones of Kīlauea or Mauna Loa as a result of this earthquake,” Shiro said. “Aftershocks are possible and could be felt.”  HVO continues to monitor Kīlauea and other Hawaiian volcanoes for any changes. Most earthquakes Kīlauea’s south flank are caused by abrupt motion of the flank itself, which moves to the southeast over the oceanic crust. The location, depth and waveforms recorded as part of Sunday’s earthquake are consistent with slip along this south flank fault. This earthquake is likely an aftershock of the 2018 magnitude-6.9 earthquake as the volcano continues to settle. According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there was no tsunami threat from this earthquake.

          The fault line, called a strike-slip fault, is where two segments of the earth crust slide past each other. Along this fault, as tension builds, earthquakes occur to release the strain. Because the North American plate and the Caribbean plate are sliding and not impinging on each other, it's uncommon for earthquakes in these areas to produce tsunamis, except in the case of underwater landslides. Tuesday's 7.7 earthquake was followed by a magnitude 6.5 earthquake hours later near Grand Cayman. Two years ago a magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred west of the Caymans along a separate segment of the fault. This earthquake activity is not related to the recent quakes in Puerto Rico. The seismic energy of the quake was felt as far away as Cancun, Mexico and Nassau in the Bahamas. The shaking was also felt in Tampa and Orlando, but was most pronounced in Miami-Dade and Broward, especially in taller buildings that swayed, as the earth below gently shook. More aftershocks are likely in the Caribbean in the coming days.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

Please enter a search term.       HAVANA (AP) — A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday. Witnesses reported strong shaking but there was no immediate word of casualties or heavy damage.  The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. “It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,” she told The Associated Press. Several South Florida buildings were being evacuated as a precation, according to city of Miami and Miami-Dade County officials. No injuries or road closures have been reported. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands see so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. “‘It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,”‘ Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.” Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she had seen manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage. Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway. “It felt to me like i was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,” he said. He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize. The USGS initially reported the magnitude at 7.3.

Please enter a search term.        At least 36 people died and more than 1,607 have been hospitalized in eastern Turkey after an earthquake rattled the region on Friday evening, according to state broadcaster TRT Haber. The 6.7-magnitude quake struck near the town of Sivrice, in eastern Elazig province, causing at least 10 buildings to collapse, Turkish Interior Minister Sulyman Soylu said. About 1,607 people were hospitalized, the Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management President (AFAD) said on Sunday. At least 45 people have been rescued from collapsed buildings, Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) said, adding that 1,521 buildings have been inspected, with 76 found to be collapsed and 645 heavily damaged. Most of the injured were in Elazig province, the epicenter of the quake, according to an AFAD statement. Video from Turkey’s IHA Broadcasting Services shows emergency crews rescuing injured people from a collapsed building. The earthquake caused five buildings to collapse in Elazig and heavy damage to a number of buildings in the area, Minister of Environment and Urbanization Murat Kurum told reporters. Preliminary reports say the earthquake lasted 40 seconds, AFAD said, adding that 3,699 search and rescue personnel have been deployed. Fifteen aftershocks have been felt in the wake, with the strongest registering at 5.4 magnitude, Soylu said. The quake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 10 km (6 miles), according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which enhances the shaking felt at the surface. About 500,000 people felt strong to very strong shaking, the USGS reported. The earthquake was felt in several other countries, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. The quake interrupted a live broadcast of Edessa TV. Video of the broadcast shows four anchors talking while everything shakes around them. All relevant departments were taking measures to ensure the safety of citizens following the earthquake, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said early Saturday. Interior, health and environment ministers were sent to the quake-hit area.

Death Toll From Eastern Turkey Earthquake Climbs to 29,2020-01-25 22:02 UTC,https://www.voanews.com/europe/death-toll-eastern-turkey-earthquake-climbs-29,"

 The death toll from a strong earthquake that rocked eastern Turkey climbed to 29 on Saturday night as rescue crews searched for people who remained trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, officials said.  Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said at a news conference earlier in the day that 18 people had been killed in Elazig province, where Friday night's quake was centered, and four in neighboring Malatya. The national disaster agency later updated the total with seven more casualties.  Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said 1,243 people had been injured, with 34 of them in intensive care but not in critical condition.  On Saturday afternoon, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the hardest-hit areas and attended the funeral of a mother and son killed in the quake. He warned people against repeating ``negative'' hearsay about the country being unprepared for earthquakes.  ``Do not listen to rumors, do not listen to anyone's negative, contrary propaganda, and know that we are your servants,'' Erdogan said.   It was followed by 398 aftershocks, the strongest of them with magnitudes 5.4 and 5.1, the disaster agency said.  Emergency workers and security forces distributed tents, beds and blankets as overnight temperatures dropped below freezing in the affected areas. Mosques, schools, sports halls and student dormitories were opened for hundreds who left their homes after the quake.  ``The earthquake was very severe. We desperately ran out [of our home],'' Emre Gocer told the state-run Anadolu news agency as he sheltered with his family at a sports hall in Sivrice. ``We don't have a safe place to stay right now.''  While visiting Sivrice and the city of Elazig, the provincial capital 565 kilometers (350 miles) east of Ankara, Erdogan promised state support for those affected by the disaster.  ``We will not leave anyone in the open,'' the Turkish leader said.  Earlier, a prosecutor in Ankara announced an investigation into ``provocative'' social media posts. Anadolu reported that Turkey's broadcasting authority was also reviewing media coverage of the quake.  At least five buildings in Sivrice and 25 in Malatya province were destroyed in the disaster, Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said. Hundreds of other structures were damaged and made unsafe.  AFAD reported that 42 people had been rescued as search teams combed wrecked apartment buildings.  Television footage showed emergency workers removing a woman from the wreckage of a collapsed building 19 hours after the main earthquake struck.  A prison in Adiyaman, 110 kilometers (70 miles) southwest of the epicenter, was evacuated because of damage, and its more than 800 prisoners were transferred to nearby jails.  AFAD said 28 rescue teams had been working around the clock. More than 2,600 personnel from 39 of Turkey's 81 provinces were sent to the disaster site. Unmanned drones were used to survey damaged neighborhoods and coordinate rescue efforts.  ``Our biggest hope is that the death toll does not rise,'' Parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop said.  Communication companies announced free telephone and internet services for residents in the quake-hit region.  Neighboring Greece, which is at odds with Turkey over maritime boundaries and gas exploration rights, offered to send rescue crews to assist the Turkish teams.  Erdogan appeared to reject the offer of outside assistance during his visit to the city of Elazig, telling reporters, ``Our state does not need anything.''  Turkey sits on top of two major fault lines, and earthquakes are frequent. Two strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey in 1999, killing around 18,000 people.  A magnitude 6.0 earthquake killed 51 people in Elazig in 2010.  "

Small Earthquake Reported in South-Central Kansas,2020-01-19 21:40 UTC,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/kansas-earthquake/2020/01/19/id/950430/,"

Sunday, 19 January 2020 03:40 PM EST

 A small earthquake was reported in southern Kansas on Sunday. The U.S. Geological Survey said a magnitude 4.4 earthquake struck about 2 miles (3 kilometers) southwest of Hutchinson shortly after 1 p.m. No damage was immediately reported. The earthquake happened near where several others have happened before in Reno County, The Hutchinson News reported. Kansas began seeing a spike in earthquakes in 2014 that were blamed on wastewater injection wells from oil and gas production. The number of quakes began tampering off after oil prices dropped and regulations were enacted.

Another earthquake hits Puerto Rico with 5.9 magnitude,2020-01-11 17:30 UTC,https://fox43.com/2020/01/11/another-earthquake-hits-puerto-rico-with-5-9-magnitude/,"An earthquake with a 5.9 magnitude rattled Puerto Rico on Saturday morning, the US Geological Survey reports. The quake was about 8 miles south of Indios, Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean Sea, the USGS said, at a depth of 6.2 miles. The USGS first said the preliminary magnitude was 6.0. Puerto Rico has been rattled by temblors throughout the week, including a 6.4 magnitude quake Tuesday that killed at least one man, destroyed homes and left most of the island without power. A 5.2 magnitude aftershock struck on Friday afternoon. The US territory was expecting power to return by Saturday to its 3 million residents, and authorities had tweeted that it was 95% restored a couple of hours before Saturday’s quake about 8 a.m. Parts of Lares, Adjuntas, Ponce and San German lost electrical service after Saturday’s quake, the power company Electric Energy Authority said. After the tremor, power was on to about 93% of the island, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority said. Since December 28, about 500 earthquakes of magnitude 2.0 or higher have hit Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017. That storm killed almost 3,000 people, and left millions of Americans without power, water or shelter. Recovery has been slow and hard. Amid the earthquakes, Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced this week declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard. She told people to stay calm and expect aftershocks. Many took mattresses, tents and tarps into their yards to sleep, afraid of what aftershocks could do to their homes, already stressed or damaged. More than 6,000 people were staying in shelters, Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, the territory’s non-voting delegate to Congress, said Friday.

5.4 aftershock hits Puerto Rico days after earthquake,2020-01-10 23:21 UTC,https://www.wesh.com/article/54-aftershock-hits-puerto-rico-days-after-earthquake/30475151,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.0 rattled Puerto Rico on Saturday morning, the U.S. Geological Survey reports. The quake was about 8 miles south of Indios, Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean Sea, the USGS said, at a depth of 6.2 miles. Puerto Rico has been rattled by temblors throughout the week, including a 6.4 magnitude quake Tuesday that killed at least one man, destroyed homes and left most of the island without power. A 5.2 magnitude aftershock struck on Friday afternoon. The U.S. territory was expecting power to return by Saturday to its 3 million residents, and authorities had tweeted that it was 95% restored a couple of hours before Saturday's quake. Parts of Lares, Adjuntas, Ponce and San German lost electrical service after Saturday's quake, the power company Electric Energy Authority said. After the tremor, power was on to about 93% of the island, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority said. Since Dec. 28, about 500 earthquakes of magnitude 2.0 or higher have hit Puerto Rico, the USGS said. On Friday,  a CNN crew said its truck moved during the aftershock, one of the strongest since Tuesday's 6.4 magnitude quake. The aftershock came as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, is making aid available and assisting with damage assessment.  Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced has declared a state of emergency, activated the Puerto Rico National Guard and urged residents to stay calm, but prepared, for aftershocks.  For many, that has meant bringing mattresses, tents and tarps into their yards to sleep, for fear of what aftershocks could do to their already damaged homes. Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico's non-voting delegate to Congress, spoke at a news conference Friday with Vázquez and Florida Sen. Rick Scott after touring the damaged Costa Sur Power Plant. She said more than 6,000 people were staying in shelters. Vázquez said she had spoken with President Donald Trump to thank him for his support and to urge his prompt approval of a major disaster declaration. Myrna Delgado said she sought refuge outside her home when the first temblors started Dec. 28. She slept in a van and then at a stadium shelter in the southwestern city of Yauco. ""I'm very nervous,"" she told CNN on Friday. ""At night I feel very depressed. We don't have light at home. With the company of other people, at least we feel safe."" Noelia de Jesus and her granddaughters are also among those in a shelter. They are also among the many who are looking for a place to stay for the third time, having lost their homes when Hurricane George struck in 1998 and again during Hurricane Maria. Luis Garcia, a resident of the southern coastal city of Guayanilla, said he was finding it harder to secure basics such as gas and food than after Hurricane Maria in 2017.  As Puerto Rico waits to see what may follow, officials are aiming to restore power by the end of the weekend. Power has been restored to about 80% of Puerto Rico's 1.4 million utility customers across the island, Puerto Rico Electric Energy Authority said via Twitter on Friday, but the goal is for everyone to have power on Saturday. Three of the territory's major power plants are expected to be in service again by Saturday, with a fourth aimed at operating on Sunday, power utility CEO Jose Ortiz said.

Full power is expected to return to Puerto Rico this weekend after earthquake,2020-01-10 12:50 UTC,https://fox61.com/2020/01/10/full-power-is-expected-to-return-to-puerto-rico-this-weekend-after-earthquake/,"The process of determining the damage left behind after an earthquake shook Puerto Rico earlier this week is underway, even as parts of the island remain without power and it remains under threat of more tremors. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, is making aid available and assisting with damage assessment after the 6.4 magnitude quake rocked the island before dawn on Tuesday. It was one of about 500 earthquakes of magnitude 2 or greater that have rattled the area since December 28, according to the US Geological Survey. The earthquake left one man dead, caused dozens of homes and other structures to crumble and left about two-thirds of residents in the dark. The US territory, still recovering from the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, expects to return power to all of its 3 million residents between Thursday and Saturday. Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with residents to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks. For many, that has meant bringing mattresses, tents and tarps into their yards to sleep, for fear of what aftershocks could do to their already damaged homes. About 2,200 people have sought refuge in one of 18 shelters, the Puerto Rico Department of Housing said. Noelia de Jesus and her granddaughters are among those in a shelter. They are also among the many who are looking for a place to stay for the third time, having lost their homes when Hurricane George struck in 1998 and again during Hurricane Maria. The US Geological Survey (USGS) has modeled three forecasts of what may be in store for Puerto Rico over the next month. The most likely scenario, the USGS said, is that the aftershocks will continue to decrease in frequency; and though there may be medium and small quakes, there will not be another earthquake like Tuesday’s in this sequence. USGS said the probability of this scenario is 84%. There a 14% chance of what is called a doublet, which is two large earthquakes of a similar size occurring in a similar location, the USGS said. Meaning there is a case in which the region could see another quake as powerful as 6.4 magnitude. Least likely is that Tuesday’s earthquake could trigger an even larger one. While the probability is small, the impacts of that scenario would be devastating, the USGS said. “The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,” the agency said. As Puerto Rico waits to see what may follow, officials are aiming to restore power by the end of the weekend. Power has been restored to about 700,000 of Puerto Rico’s 1.4 million utility customers across the island, according to Puerto Rico Electric Energy Authority CEO Jose Ortiz, but the goal is for everyone to have power on Saturday. Three of the territory’s major power plants are expected to be in service again by Saturday, with a fourth aimed at operating on Sunday, Ortiz said. But the plant that supplies about a quarter of the island’s power, Costa Sur Power Plant, suffered extensive damage and could be out of commission for a year, Ortiz said in an interview aired on “CBS This Morning.” Officials are also working to reopen schools, which have canceled classes until crews can inspect buildings and ensure their safety for students. “Classes in the public school system won’t resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,” Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won’t return to the schools until further notice.

Earthquake risk not just a west coast problem,2020-01-09 02:07 UTC,https://www.wmar2news.com/news/national/earthquake-risk-not-just-a-west-coast-problem,"Menu  This week's series of earthquakes served as a reminder that the United States' earthquake risk extends far beyond the Pacific Coast.  On Tuesday, Puerto Rico was rocked by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake. The earthquake knocked out power to most of the island, killing at least one.  Also in recent days, minor earthquakes were felt in Tennessee and Texas.  While there have been dozens of earthquakes with a  4.5 magnitude or higher throughout the United States in recent years, the eastern United States see relatively fewer. Only four earthquakes of 4.5 magnitude or greater in the last four years have impacted the eastern United States.  But the issue is not the quantity of earthquakes in the eastern United States, but the impact.  The USGS puts out a hazard map that shows the earthquake risk nationwide. The map shows areas such as the Pacific Coast and parts of Alaska and Hawaii with a high risk of peak ground accelerations. It turns out that areas of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Illinois and South Carolina. USGS scientist David Schwartz agrees that the Pacific Northwest all the way to Charleston, S.C., practically every region of the United States, has a risk of feeling a devastating earthquake. ""The nature of the crust changes as you go from east to west. The Central and Eastern US, the crust is really old, it is older it is colder, it is denser, than the crust in the west which is younger,” Schwartz said. “It’s broken up by many faults and warmer. These different crusts transmit seismic waves differently.” And this difference in geology means that a strong earthquake in the Eastern United States could cause damage over an extensive area. Although the Eastern United States has not had many major earthquakes in the last century, two of the most powerful quakes in American history have happened east of the Rockies. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake that caused damage to the Washington Monument in 2011 is only a minor example of the kind of earthquakes the Eastern United States could see. In 1811 and 1812, a series of earthquakes struck the Mississippi River valley along the New Madrid fault. The strongest of the quakes was a possible magnitude 7.8. The quake was felt across much of the Eastern United States. In 1866, a magnitude 7.0 rattled Charleston, S.C. “A repeat of any of those earthquakes would be extremely damaging, because the housing stock in the Central and Eastern U.S. has not been designed for earthquakes,” Schwartz said. According to a survey funded by the U.S. Army, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake located along the New Madrid fault could cause 85,900 deaths and $298 billion in damage. By comparison, Hurricane Katrina caused roughly 1,500 deaths and $110 billion in damage. What to do during an earthquake  About WMAR"

But the issue is not the quantity of earthquakes in the eastern United States, but the impact.  The USGS puts out a hazard map that shows the earthquake risk nationwide. The map shows areas such as the Pacific Coast and parts of Alaska and Hawaii with a high risk of peak ground accelerations. It turns out that areas of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Illinois and South Carolina. USGS scientist David Schwartz agrees that the Pacific Northwest all the way to Charleston, S.C., practically every region of the United States, has a risk of feeling a devastating earthquake. ""The nature of the crust changes as you go from east to west. The Central and Eastern US, the crust is really old, it is older it is colder, it is denser, than the crust in the west which is younger,” Schwartz said. “It’s broken up by many faults and warmer. These different crusts transmit seismic waves differently.” And this difference in geology means that a strong earthquake in the Eastern United States could cause damage over an extensive area. Although the Eastern United States has not had many major earthquakes in the last century, two of the most powerful quakes in American history have happened east of the Rockies. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake that caused damage to the Washington Monument in 2011 is only a minor example of the kind of earthquakes the Eastern United States could see. In 1811 and 1812, a series of earthquakes struck the Mississippi River valley along the New Madrid fault. The strongest of the quakes was a possible magnitude 7.8. The quake was felt across much of the Eastern United States. In 1866, a magnitude 7.0 rattled Charleston, S.C. “A repeat of any of those earthquakes would be extremely damaging, because the housing stock in the Central and Eastern U.S. has not been designed for earthquakes,” Schwartz said. According to a survey funded by the U.S. Army, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake located along the New Madrid fault could cause 85,900 deaths and $298 billion in damage. By comparison, Hurricane Katrina caused roughly 1,500 deaths and $110 billion in damage. What to do during an earthquake "
Earthquake risk not just a west coast problem,2020-01-09 02:07 UTC,https://www.fox47news.com/news/national/earthquake-risk-not-just-a-west-coast-problem,"Menu  This week's series of earthquakes served as a reminder that the United States' earthquake risk extends far beyond the Pacific Coast.  On Tuesday, Puerto Rico was rocked by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake. The earthquake knocked out power to most of the island, killing at least one.  Also in recent days, minor earthquakes were felt in Tennessee and Texas.

Puerto Rico starts to restore electricity after magnitude 6.4 earthquake,2020-01-08 16:48 UTC,https://www.local10.com/news/national/2020/01/08/puerto-rico-starts-to-restore-electricity-after-magnitude-64-earthquake/,"Andrea Torres, Digital Journalist Victor Oquendo - ABC News Correspondent, ABC News   Andrea Torres, Digital Journalist Victor Oquendo - ABC News Correspondent, ABC News  GUANICA, Puerto Rico – Puerto Rico’s electrical grid is slowly going back in service on Wednesday, after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake forced shutdowns in the southern region leaving more than two-thirds of the island without power.  According to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which serves about 1.5 million customers, service was restored to about half a million customers. Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vazquez traveled to the Costa Sur Power Plant Complex in the coastal municipality of Guayanilla to inspect the damage. In the coastal town of Guánica, “We are confronting a crisis worse than Hurricane Maria,” Mayor Santos Seda told the Associated Press, while referring to the 2017 storm that devastated the island. “I am asking for empathy from the federal government.” La prioridad de nuestra Gobernadora, @wandavazquezg es la seguridad de nuestra gente. El equipo de la #ODSEC con su DE, @JesusVelezPR, llega a Guánica para continuar brindando apoyo en el refugio, como parte de los esfuerzos del Gobierno Central. #ComprometidosConPR pic.twitter.com/vt3uUMJmVa The earthquake left at least one person dead and nine injured. Vazquez activated the National Guard and closed public schools during the search and rescue phase. Members of USAR South Florida Task Force 2 left Miami International Airport on Tuesday night to join the efforts in Puerto Rico.  According to the U.S. Geological Service, there have been 32 earthquakes of magnitude 4 or greater since Dec. 28, including the 5.8 magnitude earthquake on Jan. 6 and the strong quake and aftershocks on Tuesday. Seismologists estimate that over the next week there is a low chance of more aftershocks that are stronger than Tuesday’s quake.  Officials say there are more than 200 people at this makeshift shelter in Guánica, Puerto Rico. Many tell me they’re afraid to return home after a 6.4 magnitude and several strong aftershocks. pic.twitter.com/oWqTTMnRg4 Copyright 2020 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved. A highly-trained task force in Miami was preparing Tuesday night to search for and rescue the victims of the devastating 6.4 magnitude earthquake that turned some buildings into rubble in Puerto Rico, according to the Miami Fire Rescue Department. A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck Puerto Rico before dawn on Tuesday, and was followed three hours later by an aftershock measuring 6.0. They are the largest in a series of quakes that have struck the U.S. territory in recent days and caused heavy damage in some areas.

A 6.5 magnitude earthquake hit Puerto Rico a day after another quake rocked the island,2020-01-07 09:53 UTC,https://fox43.com/2020/01/07/a-6-5-magnitude-earthquake-hit-puerto-rico-a-day-after-another-quake-rocked-the-island/,"A 6.5 magnitude earthquake rocked Puerto Rico early Tuesday morning, just one day after a 5.8 magnitude quake shook the island, according to the United States Geological Service earthquake map.  The Authority of Electrical Energy, the power company for Puerto Rico, said that power plants have activated an auto protective mechanism and are out of service following the earthquake. On Twitter, Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced told citizens to remain calm as the government responds to the most recent quake. “I hope all are well. We are getting our information from @NMEADpr and @DSPnoticias,” the tweet said. “The entire government is active and in action. I ask our people to remain calm and urge you to remain safe.” No tsunami is expected following the earthquake, the US National Tsunami Warning Center said. There were no immediate reports of damage following Tuesday’s quake. Geologists warned that more earthquakes, known as aftershocks and tremors, would follow Monday’s quake. “When there are more earthquakes, the chance of a large earthquake is greater which means that the chance of damage is greater,” the USGS said. On Monday, the early morning quake in the same area caused some damage, including a home collapse in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, Director of Emergency Management Carlos Acevedo said. Acevedo also said that rock slides along Route 2 were reported.  — Bradon Long FOX43 (@bradonlongwx) January 7, 2020  Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     In Other News Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings."

Please enter a search term.     (CNN) — An earthquake struck Puerto Rico early Monday, with plenty of aftershocks expected.  It was centered about 8 miles south-southeast of Indios, Puerto Rico, and struck at a depth of about 3.7 miles below ground. At least two houses collapsed in the southwestern coastal town of Guanica, Director of Emergency Management Carlos Acevedo told CNN affiliate WAPA-TV. Acevedo said one of the homes was abandoned. Some victims of the earthquake posted photos of deep cracks in walls. No tsunami warning was issued after the quake. But geologists warn of more tremors to come. “More earthquakes than usual (called aftershocks) will continue to occur near the mainshock,” the USGS said. “When there are more earthquakes, the chance of a large earthquake is greater which means that the chance of damage is greater.” The agency advised anyone in or near vulnerable structures to be extra cautious and said those caught in potential quakes should drop, cover and hold on.

Magnitude 6.3 earthquake strikes Croatia; 5 deaths reported,2020-12-29 16:44 UTC,https://www.wcax.com/2020/12/29/magnitude-63-earthquake-strikes-croatia-5-deaths-reported/,"PETRINJA, Croatia (AP) — A strong earthquake in Croatia destroyed buildings and killed at least seven people Tuesday southwest of the capital, displacing scores of area residents or making them afraid to sleep indoors as emergency teams searched for those still missing by nightfall.  Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. Another six people were killed in nearly destroyed villages close to the town, according to HRT state television. At least 26 people were hospitalized, six with serious injuries, officials said, adding that many more people remained unaccounted for. In Petrinja, cries could be heard from underneath destroyed houses. One woman was found alive some four hours after the quake. Emergency teams used rescue dogs in the search for survivors, while family members looked on in despair. “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT. “This is like Hiroshima - half of the city no longer exists.” Firefighters worked to remove the debris from a collapsed building that fell on a car. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the vehicle and carried into an ambulance. The town was left without electricity or running water as officials scrambled to set up temporary accommodation for all of the displaced residents in need. Residents fearing another earthquake seemed poised to spend the night outside their homes. Petrinja resident Marica Pavlovic said the quake felt “worse than a war.” “It was horrible, a shock. You don’t know what to do, whether to run out or hide somewhere,” she told The Associated Press. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable,” Plenkovic said. He said the army has 500 places ready in barracks to house people, while others will be accommodated in nearby hotels and other places. “No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” the prime minister said. Officials also toured a damaged hospital in the nearby town of Sisak, which was also badly hit. Plenkovic said the patients will be evacuated in army helicopters and ambulances. Health officials said a baby was delivered in a tent in front of the hospital in the aftermath of the earthquake. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that she spoke with Plenkovic and instructed an envoy to travel to Croatia as soon as possible. As a Mediterranean country, Croatia is prone to earthquakes, but not big ones. The last strong quake struck in the 1990s when the picturesque Adriatic coast village of Ston was destroyed. The Croatian military was deployed in the quake-hit region to help with the rescue operation. Croatian seismologist Kresimir Kuk described the earthquake as “extremely strong,” far stronger than another one that hit Zagreb and nearby areas in the spring. He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky old buildings and move to newer areas of the city because of aftershocks. In the capital, people ran into the streets in fear. The earthquake was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia and Slovenia. It was felt as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported. Authorities in Slovenia said the Krsko nuclear power plant was temporarily shut down following the earthquake. The power plant is jointly owned by Slovenia and Croatia and located near their border. ___ AP writers Dusan Stojanovic and Jovana Gec in Belgrade, Serbia, contributed to this report.

Magnitude 6.3 earthquake strikes Croatia; 5 deaths reported,2020-12-29 16:44 UTC,https://www.kfyrtv.com/2020/12/29/magnitude-63-earthquake-strikes-croatia-5-deaths-reported/,"PETRINJA, Croatia (AP) — A strong earthquake in Croatia destroyed buildings and killed at least seven people Tuesday southwest of the capital, displacing scores of area residents or making them afraid to sleep indoors as emergency teams searched for those still missing by nightfall.  Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. Another six people were killed in nearly destroyed villages close to the town, according to HRT state television. At least 26 people were hospitalized, six with serious injuries, officials said, adding that many more people remained unaccounted for. In Petrinja, cries could be heard from underneath destroyed houses. One woman was found alive some four hours after the quake. Emergency teams used rescue dogs in the search for survivors, while family members looked on in despair. “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT. “This is like Hiroshima - half of the city no longer exists.” Firefighters worked to remove the debris from a collapsed building that fell on a car. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the vehicle and carried into an ambulance. The town was left without electricity or running water as officials scrambled to set up temporary accommodation for all of the displaced residents in need. Residents fearing another earthquake seemed poised to spend the night outside their homes. Petrinja resident Marica Pavlovic said the quake felt “worse than a war.” “It was horrible, a shock. You don’t know what to do, whether to run out or hide somewhere,” she told The Associated Press. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable,” Plenkovic said. He said the army has 500 places ready in barracks to house people, while others will be accommodated in nearby hotels and other places. “No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” the prime minister said. Officials also toured a damaged hospital in the nearby town of Sisak, which was also badly hit. Plenkovic said the patients will be evacuated in army helicopters and ambulances.

"Shakes, tremors after earthquake strikes northern South Dakota",2020-12-10 00:41 UTC,https://www.kfyrtv.com/2020/12/10/shakes-tremors-after-earthquake-strikes-northern-south-dakota/,"BOWDLE, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - Residents in Edmunds and Walworth counties are still trying to make sense of the rumbling and shaking they felt Tuesday night after an earthquake struck just north of Bowdle. Just before heading to bed last night, Bowdle Mayor Rick Boschee heard something strange, almost like a storm had suddenly moved in over the area. “I heard a loud bang, and I thought it could’ve been lighting and thunder, you know. We did set a record high yesterday, so it wouldn’t surprise me,” Boschee said. But what he really heard was an earthquake. The United States Geological Survey detected a small earthquake just before midnight seven miles north of Bowdle, registering at a 3.2 on the Richter scale, just above the threshold where quakes can be felt. And the shaking was much more intense closer to the epicenter. “My daughter, son-in-law, her family, they live out there. And she told me they could really feel it there. Of course, they’re only about three miles from where it actually took place,” Boschee said. Boschee said the earthquake was the talk of the town Wednesday, with most only hearing a rumbling sound but some experiencing some shaking. “I know there’s been a little talk this morning in town. People that have heard it or felt it didn’t know what it was. Yeah, it’s quite interesting.” It’s the second earthquake to hit the state this year. The other struck near Platte earlier this year but was too weak to be felt. Earthquakes are rare in South Dakota, but they’re not unheard of. The last earthquake to hit the state that could be felt struck near Onida in 2017. Boschee said the one that struck Tuesday night is just another item on the list of strange and crazy things to happen this year. “It’s 2020. So with the pandemic and politics, why should we be surprised by an earthquake really?” Since 1900, the USGS has recorded 67 earthquakes that either struck South Dakota or hit close enough to be felt within the state. Most were located along the Missouri River and James River valleys, or in the Black Hills Region. The earthquake that hit Bowdle Tuesday night was the largest since 2018, when a 3.2 magnitude was recorded north of Valentine, Nebraska. Copyright 2020 Dakota News Now. All rights reserved."

Please enter a search term.       ISTANBUL — A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 19 people and injuring over 700 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 17 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, including one who drowned, and 709 were injured, according to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Among the dead were the wife and two children of the secretary-general of the Turkish Medical Association’s Izmir branch, the group said. On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying “Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children.” At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall and cranes lifted concrete slabs from the wreckage.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul’s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey’s largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter — roughly 10 kilometers — potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 3,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens. France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France’s “full solidarity with Greece and Turkey” and said “we are ready to offer the necessary aid.” The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. Some islanders planned to spend the night in emergency tents for fear of aftershocks. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. “We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,” Turkey’s Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. “This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We’re ready to help if Greece needs it.” Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, tweeted that he had phoned Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together.” Erdogan responded to the tweet with his thanks and offered his condolences. “Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,” he wrote. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and NATO allies. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

LOS ANGELES -- An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.5 rattled Southern California Friday night, hitting near South El Monte with shaking felt in a wide swath of the region.  Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones told Eyewitness News the quake was similar in type and location to the deadly 1987 Whittier-Narrows quake which had a magnitude of 5.9. But this one was much smaller in power. ""Here in Pasadena I felt it,"" Jones said. ""It woke me up."" She added that there were at least two aftershocks, measuring 2.1 and 1.6. She also said there is a 5% chance that it was a foreshock to a larger quake.  There is also about a 50% chance of additional small aftershocks within the next 24 hours, she said. The earthquake was initially estimated at 4.8, then downgraded to 4.6 and then to 4.5. A shake map produced by the USGS indicates the rattling was felt south to San Diego, north to Santa Barbara and east well out into the Inland Empire and the Mojave Desert, as well as off the coast on Catalina and Santa Cruz islands.   There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, but local police and fire departments said they were on alert and surveying their communities for damage. Los Angeles International Airport also reported not finding any damage.

Cleanup continues more than a week after a historic 5.1 magnitude earthquake rocked our state.  On Tuesday, officials gave an update on the damage.  More than a week after an intense earthquake quake hit, sisters Alice Estep and Mary Estep Crouse said the sound of destruction is still fresh in their minds. “It sounded like the house was blowing up. Everything was moving everything was falling and she was screaming get out of here get out of here,” said Alice Estep whose home was damaged by the earthquake. But instead of an explosion, the two sisters who had lived inside this home for nearly 55 years experienced the strongest earthquake to hit this area in more than 100 years.  “It was like the house was going like this twisting and things were dropping and we were hearing loud drops and we knew we had to get out” said Alice. The quake hit their home – making it uninhabitable. Emergency officials said 10 families have been displaced and reports of damage are still coming in.  “As far as the functioning of the building and everything nothing was that injured. It just has you concerned when you see cracks in these gigantic rocks,” said Dr. Rob Klingensmith whose business was damaged. And as geologists and researchers continue to learn more about what happened, the mayor of Sparta is pleading for help.   “The elderly population here cannot afford to fix their homes because insurance is not going to cover it. Don’t forget about Sparta and Alleghany County,” said Mayor Wes Brinegar.  And as folks continue to clean up the damage the Sheriff of Alleghany County is asking for volunteers to help clean up.

         For years, scientists have been attempting to track an extremely rare ""boomerang"" earthquake. Now, they've recorded one in the ocean for the first time — and it's even more bizarre than they expected.  Earthquakes are the result of rocks breaking on a fault, which is a boundary between two plates. A ""boomerang"" earthquake, also known as a ""back-propagating supershear rupture,"" means the fracture travels away from the initial crack before returning to it at even faster speeds, scientists said.  Large earthquakes are capable of destroying buildings and triggering tsunamis, so understanding how they work is imperative to assessing potential hazards and implementing warning systems for future quakes.  According to a new study in the journal Nature Geoscience, a team, led by scientists from the University of Southampton and Imperial College London, successfully recorded a magnitude 7.1 earthquake on August 29, 2016. It ran along the Romanche fracture zone, a 560-mile-long fault line under the Atlantic Ocean near the equator, between Brazil and Africa.   Scientists say that large — meaning magnitude 7 or higher — quakes are difficult to study because they often set off a series of chain reactions along intricate networks of faults. Faults under the ocean have simple shapes, but they are located far away from seismometer networks on land, so an underwater network of seismometers is needed.  Researchers said the quake traveled in one direction between the South American and African tectonic plates, then boomeranged back to the start at ultra-fast speeds — breaking the ""seismic sound barrier"" — a sonic boom of sorts.  An analysis revealed the quake had two distinct phases. The rupture traveled upward and eastward first, before suddenly reversing and heading back west to the center of the fault at an accelerated speed of 3.7 miles per second.  Scientists aren't exactly sure how this occurred, but they believe the first phase somehow triggered its more aggressive counterpart.  Only a handful of boomerang earthquakes have ever been recorded — the phenomenon has mostly been theoretical, until now.  ""Whilst scientists have found that such a reversing rupture mechanism is possible from theoretical models, our new study provides some of the clearest evidence for this enigmatic mechanism occurring in a real fault,"" lead author Dr. Stephen Hicks, from the Department of Earth Sciences and Engineering at Imperial College London, said in a press release.  ""Even though the fault structure seems simple, the way the earthquake grew was not, and this was completely opposite to how we expected the earthquake to look before we started to analyze the data."" Scientists said that if a similar type of quake occurred on land, it would drastically affect the amount of ground shaking — and possibly widen the affected area. Successfully tracking more boomerang quakes would allow researchers to better predict and assess the hazards from such events, improving impact forecasts.  Sophie Lewis is a social media manager and trending content writer for CBS News.

Sparta building damaged after 5.1 magnitude earthquake hits NC,2020-08-10 21:20 UTC,https://www.wxii12.com/article/sparta-factory-damaged-after-51-magnitude-earthquake-hits-nc/33565742,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. As people in Sparta continue to clean up after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake rocked parts of North Carolina, the damage to some buildings throughout the town is significant.    The owner of a building that houses several companies in Sparta said the damage inside is extensive, and with no earthquake insurance, she’s trying to figure out what’s next.  “Complete devastation we were speechless yesterday. We woke up yesterday morning with the huge shakes and just trying to hang on for dear life,” said Katherine Shore, who owns the building. Shore said it houses a few different companies. Inside, you can only walk a few feet before hearing the crunch of the glass from damaged lights that were knocked down.   “Shock, just absolute shock — and we were in awe of the damage and how much had been done,” Shore said. The earthquake could also be felt in other states.   “It’s more, I think, than people away from here realize. You know, it really was a big hit,"" Shore said. The quake also knocked out power to Shore's building. The damage assessment continues and the cleanup begins.  “Lots and lots of blood sweat and tears I’m sure to come,” Shore said. The insurance commissioner said if people have damage and do not have the correct insurance coverage, as of now, they are going to have to pay out of pocket, and that it is too early to tell if any type of relief could come from the state.

It left a significant amount of damage downtown with bricks falling off several buildings. “We had gotten woken up by a boom a little after two and couldn’t go back to sleep,” said Jacob Church, a resident of Sparta. The town was rocked early Sunday morning by a 5.1 magnitude earthquake that no one saw coming. “At first it was like, ‘What’s going on?’ None of us were injured. I think it’s a cool thing to be a part of that,” said Brandon Lineberry who was visiting at the time. The quake rattling a cemetery so hard, it uprooted headstones from the ground. Just a few miles from downtown the North Carolina Department of Transportation was dealing with the damage to a water main. “We’re just trying to get it back open. It’s buckled up the road a little from the water main, from the earthquake, and we’re just trying to get it back to normal,” said Jeffery Jones with the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The damage was significant at Scott’s Landscaping Nursery and Farms, leaving several cracks in the parking lot and shattering pottery. “It’s been a rough morning. You don’t expect anything like this to happen here because it doesn’t happen here. 2020 has been a rough year for a lot of people,” said Scott Smith, owner of Scott’s Landscaping Nursery and Farms. The emergency management team says residents should call the local sheriff’s department to report any major damage.

         PACOIMA (CBSLA) -- A 4.2-magnitude earthquake struck the Pacoima area of the San Fernando Valley early Thursday morning and was felt across the Southland. It was followed up by two large aftershocks.  The earthquake was initially recorded as a 4.5, but later downgraded to a 4.2. It struck at a depth of 4.9 miles. It was felt as far south as San Diego and as far north as Bakersfield, people reported to the USGS. ""I really thought, like, my son fell off the bed or something,"" Pacoima resident Robert Legaspi told CBSLA. ""So I get up. So, my wife has an app that alerted, but it was a nice shake.""   Renowned seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones called Thursday's temblors of the ""garden variety."" The earthquake occurred in the Sierra Madre Fault Zone, said Paul Caruso with the USGS in a virtual briefing. By late morning, more than 60 aftershocks had been detected, Caltech seismologist Jen Andrews said. Andrews said the temblor is not surprising, given the array of fault zones in the area. She noted that Thursday morning's shaker occurred at the intersection of faults responsible for the 1971 San Fernando earthquake and the 1994 Northridge quake, but there was no way to draw any connection with those events. There were no reports of injuries or significant damage, the Los Angeles Fire Department reported. LAFD engaged its Earthquake Emergency Mode, with fire engines and helicopters canvassing its 470 square-mile jurisdiction. Caltrans was also sending crews around the region to ensure that no bridges had been damaged as well. This appears to be the most strongly felt earthquake in the region since a pair of earthquakes struck the Kern County region of Ridgecrest and Searles Valley in the Mohave Desert on consecutive days in July of 2019. On the morning of July 4, 2019, the region was hit by a magnitude 6.4 quake, the largest to hit Southern California in 20 years. However, that turned out to only be a foreshock to the main shock, the magnitude 7.1 earthquake which struck on the night of July 5, ten times larger than the 6.4 quake.

The earthquake was centered 60 miles, or 98 kilometers, south-southeast, of Perryville, Alaska, according to the US Geological Survey. The quake is considered shallow at about six miles, or 10 kilometers, deep.  “Anything below 70 kilometers is considered a shallow quake,” CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. “That’s important, because shallow earthquakes often cause the most damage, compared to the ones that are deeper, regardless of the strength.”  Earthquakes are more likely to develop into tsunamis if they are high in magnitude, are shallow, and are thrust earthquakes rather than strike slip earthquakes, according to the USGS. Quakes between magnitudes 7.6 to 7.8 have the potential to produce destructive tsunamis.

7.4 magnitude earthquake hits southern Mexico; at least 5 dead,2020-06-24 05:50 UTC,https://www.myarklamiss.com/news/international/7-4-magnitude-earthquake-hits-southern-mexico-at-least-5-dead/,"KTVE - myarklamiss.com Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.     Mexico (CNN) (06/24/20)– A 7.4 magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico’s southern coastline on Tuesday, collapsing buildings and prompting evacuations, has left at least five people dead, officials said.  At least five people were killed, according to the coordinator for Mexico’s National Civil Protection Service. Oaxaca state Gov. Alejandro Murat said a 22-year-old woman and a man were among the dead. The Oaxacan Health Services also reported damages from the quake to general hospitals in Pochutla, Puerto Escondido and Pinotepa Nacional and a few community hospitals in other areas.  According to Murat, two of the hospitals with damages have been dealing with coronavirus patients. “We are verifying [damages] because this hospital is also tending Covid cases on the Oaxacan coast,” he said on a radio interview with Radio Fórmula. The severity of the damages are not specified. The National Civil Protection Service reported the first death after a structure collapsed after the earthquake, which occurred just east of the popular tourist destination Huatulco. Authorities also reported a power outage throughout the state’s capital and damages to the exterior of a hospital in Oaxaca. The earthquake could be felt as far as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. In capital Mexico City, approximately 190 miles north of the epicenter, tremors were felt and sirens were heard wailing. Tsunami waves of 0.68 meters (2.2 ft) were observed in Acapulco and 0.71 meters (2.3 ft) in Salina Cru.  An earlier tsunami warning was revised down, according to the U.S. Tsunami Warning System, forecasting possible waves of up to a meter (3.3 ft). The damage in Oaxaca state is considered light to moderate, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) ShakeMap. Estimates modeled by the USGS suggest that localized casualties and damage are possible but there are likely to be fewer than 100 fatalities and less than $100 million in damage.  However, the model only includes earthquake shaking, and not any impacts from potential tsunamis on the coastline. The USGS said that recent earthquakes in the area have caused secondary hazards such as tsunamis and landslides. Earlier estimates put the magnitude of the earthquake at 7.7, but that has been revised down to 7.4 (and additional revisions are possible). Mexico is one of the world’s most seismically active regions and has a long history of devastating earthquakes. The country is located on top of three large tectonic plates and their movement causes regular quakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. In 2017, two powerful earthquakes hit the country in two weeks, toppling buildings, cracking highways, and killing hundreds of people. One had a magnitude of 7.1 and the other a magnitude of 8.1. Mexico City is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes because its very soft and wet ground amplifies shaking and is prone to liquefaction, in which dirt transforms into a dense liquid when sufficiently churned.

Don't hold Puerto Rico hostage: Pass the Earthquake Supplemental,2020-05-08 00:00 UTC,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/496679-dont-hold-puerto-rico-hostage-pass-the-earthquake-supplemental-act,"Still recovering from the disastrous Hurricane Maria of 2017, Puerto Rico was dealt another body blow on Jan. 7 this year when a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit the Island. About 8,300 houses were damaged and 2,500 were declared uninhabitable.  Aftershocks have caused more damage, including a May 2 quake which displaced 66 families in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The U.S. government initially looked like it would provide immediate help. In February the House passed the Puerto Rico Earthquake Supplemental to help Puerto Rico recover from the earthquake and ongoing aftershocks. But then President Trump threatened to veto the bill and the Senate refused to take any action. With the Senate back in session this week the question remains whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can be persuaded to pass the Earthquake Supplemental or include it in the next COVID-19 bill.    In its veto threat, the Trump administration argued that Puerto Rico “is already projected to receive $90 billion in disaster funds.” Not true. Federal agencies have only allocated $45 billion in disaster funds for Hurricane Maria, even though the damage it caused is estimated at close to $100 billion.  Worse, of the $45 billion allocated for Hurricane Maria, less than half — $16 billion — has been disbursed. Most of this money has been spent by FEMA to provide for the immediate needs of the disaster victims (e.g. water, food, shelter, medical care, etc.), support local government emergency response and mitigate hazards in future disasters. The other large piece of the $45 billion pot is $20 billion in HUD’s Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) for long-term recovery and reconstruction, including housing, infrastructure and economic revitalization. Of the $20 billion allocated, only $3 billion has been released by the Federal government, in part because the government of Puerto Rico is required to comply with multiple conditions to allay Trump’s concerns over corruption.   These conditions are being imposed even though a HUD financial monitor has already been assigned to oversee the CDBG funds. To add insult to injury, the only government officials associated with the hurricane recovery who have been arrested to date worked for FEMA. So for the Trump administration to claim, as it does in its veto threat, that there is enough money in Puerto Rico’s disaster pipeline is absolutely misleading. First, the federal government has not released the bulk of the recovery and reconstruction funds almost three years after Hurricane Maria. Second, the $45 billion is authorized to be spent on hurricane-related activities, not the earthquakes. In its veto threat, the Trump administration also objects to “the creation of in excess of $15 billion in new Federal subsidies through the tax code” without explaining that $14 billion of that amount are Earned Income Tax Credits and Child Tax Credits. These credits would put money directly in the pockets of working Puerto Ricans and pump money straight into the economy without local government participation. So, if the Trump administration is really concerned about government corruption, this is precisely the type of mechanism to use to aid those in greatest need.  Shortly after the January earthquake Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) flew to Puerto Rico and said, “I will work my tail off to make sure that all the resources that can be available will be available.” In February, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted, “PuertoRico needs more help after the recent earthquakes added to its already existing challenges. From my role on the Senate Appropriations Committee we will work on an aid plan that can pass in both the Senate & House & be signed by the President.”  Trump’s veto threat put a halt to their plans. All Scott and Rubio had to offer after last week’s earthquake were thoughts and prayers. But there is a path forward. The House and Senate are currently wrestling over the next COVID-19 stimulus bill. Democrats are pushing for more, Republicans for less.   These struggles do not occur in a vacuum. Biden is running against Trump in Florida neck to neck. The Puerto Rico Earthquake Supplemental is ready to go. It would help the GOP senators and the president if they had something to show in November to Puerto Ricans voters in Florida.  Puerto Ricans have been crippled and killed by three consecutive disasters — Hurricane Maria, the 2020 earthquakes and COVID-19 — in under three years.

Earthquake reported in western North Carolina,2020-05-04 16:02 UTC,https://www.wxii12.com/article/western-north-carolina-earthquake-reported-hendersonville/32365748,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. A 2.3 magnitude earthquake was reported in western North Carolina Sunday night, according to the United States Geological Survey agency. The earthquake was reported around 9 p.m. Sunday about two miles southwest of Valley Hill in Henderson County.  There are no reports of residents feeling the earthquake. Since 1776 or perhaps even earlier, people living inland in North and South Carolina and in adjacent parts of Georgia and Tennessee have felt small earthquakes and suffered damage from infrequent larger ones. The largest earthquake in the area -- a magnitude 5.1 -- occurred in 1916. Moderately damaging earthquakes strike the inland Carolinas every few decades, and smaller earthquakes are felt about once each year or two.

Magnitude 6.5 Earthquake Strikes Idaho: USGS,2020-04-01 02:09 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/magnitude-6-5-earthquake-strikes-idaho-usgs_3293390.html,"A 6.5 magnitude earthquake struck Idaho on Tuesday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The earthquake struck just before 5 p.m., the USGS reported, with its epicenter 73 miles northeast of Meridian, Idaho—west of Challis. Its depth was reportedly 6.2 miles. According to the site, thousands of people across several states reported shaking.  — NWS Boise (@NWSBoise) April 1, 2020  
A health unit coordinator from a hospital emergency room on the front line of Idaho’s CCP virus outbreak in Blaine County—some 65 miles south of the epicenter—said he felt the quake, but that it didn’t interfere with the treatment of any patients.
“It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” Marcus Smith said, adding that the tremor added stress during an already stressful time for the region.
“Until the next one, I guess,” he said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.”
A Stanley restaurant owner described the earthquake as a “roar” and said he heard the quake before he felt it.
“I heard the roar, and at first, it sounded like the wind, but then the roar was tremendous,” Brett Woolley said shortly after the quake struck. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I’m sitting here perfectly still, and the water next to me is still vibrating.”
“Boise, yes, you did feel an earthquake,” Boise Mayor Lauren McLean wrote on Twitter shortly after the quake.
Several social media users posted videos online that appeared to show household items shaking as the earthquake rattled the region.
It was reportedly felt as far as Spokane and regions in western Montana, including Corvallis, Hamilton, and Missoula, KPAX reported.

The USGS reported a 4.8 magnitude aftershock.
The 6.5 magnitude quake struck less than two weeks after a sizeable 5.7 magnitude earthquake rattled a region outside Salt Lake City, causing damage to buildings and sparking evacuations.
No damage has been reported in Boise from the quake, and according to KTVB, there was a delay in reporting from USGS due to social distancing measures implemented because of the CCP (Chinese Community Party) virus, commonly known as the novel coronavirus.

Croatia Earthquake Injures 17 Amid Partial CCP Virus Lockdown,2020-03-22 15:37 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/strong-earthquake-shakes-croatia-damaging-buildings-in-capital_3281402.html,"ZAGREB, Croatia—A strong earthquake shook Croatia and its capital on Sunday, causing panic, the evacuation of hospitals, and widespread damage—including to the city’s iconic cathedral—all amid a partial CCP virus lockdown. The Epoch Times refers to the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, as the CCP virus because the Chinese Communist Party’s coverup and mismanagement allowed the virus to spread throughout China and create a global pandemic. A 15-year-old was reported to be in critical condition and 16 others were injured, authorities said.  Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the earthquake was the biggest in Zagreb in the last 140 years. Many buildings in the capital cracked and walls and rooftops were damaged. Downtown streets were littered with debris. Concrete slabs fell on cars and chimneys landed in front of entrances. Footage from the scene showed mothers dressed in nightgowns hugging their newborn babies in a parking lot as they evacuated a damaged maternity hospital amid freezing temperatures. The women, newborn babies, and incubators were being moved to a new location with the help of the army. Zagreb’s iconic cathedral was also damaged, with the top of one of its two spires collapsing. The cathedral was rebuilt after it toppled in the 1880 earthquake. Power was cut as people ran out of their homes. Several fires were also reported. At least two other tremors were recorded later. Residents shared photos of belongings falling off shelves, broken bottles and glass inside homes. Officials first said a 15-year-old was killed, but doctors later said that she is in critical condition and that they are fighting for her life. They gave no immediate details on the extent of other injuries. The earthquake struck amid a partial lockdown of the capital because of the spread of the CCP virus. People were told to avoid public areas, such as parks and public squares, but had little choice as they fled their residences. Up to five people are allowed to be together while keeping distance. The prime minister urged the citizens to remain calm and stay outside their homes in the central parts of Zagreb, which sustained the most damage. “We have two parallel crisis that contradict each other,” Plenkovic said after an emergency meeting of Croatia’s top officials. Croatian soldiers wearing masks and carrying shovels could be seen helping efforts to clear the damage on the streets of Zagreb. Top officials toured the damaged areas as some citizens criticized city authorities over the poor states of buildings in the old part of the city, some of which date back to the 19th century. “We will try to clear the streets as soon as possible,” the prime minister said. “Stay outside your homes and keep distance.” Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic said the situation was complicated by the restrictive CCP virus-related measures in place. “There are rules for when there is an earthquake, but when there is an earthquake at the same time when there is a global pandemic, then it’s a much more complex situation.” Bozinovic told the state HINA news agency.

The quake hit about 60 miles off the coast of Russia’s Kuril Islands, said the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) on Thursday, adding that it occurred at a depth of around 100 miles. Public broadcaster NHK showed shelves shaking at its office in Kushiro, located on the coast of Hokkaido. Hokkaido police said they received no reports of damage or injuries in the prefecture, according to ABC News. The quake is not likely to cause any damage or a tsunami because of its distance to the coast and its depth.  — BGSseismology (@BGSseismology) February 13, 2020  
The U.S. Tsunami Warning System said there was no tsunami threat to Guam, Rota, Tinian, or Saipan after the earthquake struck. The Japan Meteorological Agency added that there was no tsunami threat to Japan as well, Reuters reported.
On Wednesday, a 5.2 magnitude earthquake struck near Japan’s Fukushima Prefecture, the USGS reported.
In that quake, there were no reports of injuries or damage, reported the Japan Times.

On the Anniversary of the New Madrid Earthquake - Here's how to prepare for the next quake,2020-02-07 22:53 UTC,https://www.ky3.com/content/news/Earthquake-Prepardness-Month--How-Springfield-is-preparing-for-the-risk-567675211.html,"February is earthquake preparedness month, and today marks 208 years since Missouri has seen a major earthquake.  In 1812 a major 7.5 earthquake destroyed the town of New Madrid in the Bootheel of Missouri. Effects from the quake were felt in St. Louis, and tremors rang the bells in Philadelphia.  The seismic waves also developed a few smaller fault lines here in the Ozarks. Most of these faults are inactive, or only have small tremors.  The fault line in New Madrid on average goes off every six hundred years. While the risk is low for a major earthquake to occur, smaller tremors are felt thousands of times a year. If another major earthquake were to shake Missouri, the effects of it would even be felt here in Springfield. Matt Forir, the Greene County Geologist, said distance would not necessarily weaken the seismic waves. Because the earth’s crust and rock is thicker under Missouri, the energy from the epicenter would travel.  “We’re going to feel it here, and it’s not going to be diminished much from the epicenter. If we have that eight point or larger, there’s going to be damage,” Forir said.  With the population of Missouri and Arkansas having increased in the last 200 years, the effects would be more devastating.  When it comes to Springfield, Greene County Emergency Management is most prepared for a large influx of people evacuating the Bootheel.  “As far as evacuations go, you’re looking at people evacuating west.” Russell said.  Springfield will likely become a hub for recovery efforts, as it is centrally located. Greene County Emergency management has taken special training to prepare for this type of event, and for disasters similar.  While the likelihood of a major earthquake happening is slim, earthquakes are not predictable, so preparedness is key.   “What are you going to do if you’re in a house? We’ll you’re going to find an archway, a doorway to get into, you’re going to find some place that’s stable above you.” Forir said.  If you are outside, Forir recommends sitting down and just pay attention to what is above you.   "
"Weeks after a deadly earthquake, Puerto Rico is rattled again",2020-02-04 19:46 UTC,https://myfox8.com/news/weeks-after-a-deadly-earthquake-puerto-rico-is-rattled-again/,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.        A magnitude 5 earthquake hit Puerto Rico on Tuesday where people are still on edge from a series of quakes after last month’s deadly 6.4 earthquake.  It was the 11th earthquake of at least that size in the past 30 days, according to the US Geological Survey. The earthquake’s center was 13 miles southeast of Guanica on the southwest coast, according to the US Geological Survey.  The magnitude 6.4 earthquake on January 7 left one person dead, destroyed dozens of homes and structures, and left 300,000 without water and two-thirds of the island without power. Since late December, a series of quakes — about 500 of magnitude 2 or greater — have rattled Puerto Rico, hitting infrastructure already weakened from Category 5 Hurricane Maria that struck the island in September 2017.

Magnitude 7.7 earthquake strikes off the coast of Jamaica and is felt as far away as Miami,2020-01-28 21:34 UTC,https://www.ksat.com/news/world/2020/01/28/magnitude-77-earthquake-strikes-off-the-coast-of-jamaica-and-is-felt-as-far-away-as-miami/,"See the complete list WEATHER ALERT Steve Almasy, Brandon Miller and Alla Eshchenko, CNN  Steve Almasy, Brandon Miller and Alla Eshchenko, CNN  A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Tuesday about 80 miles from Jamaica, shaking people in the Caribbean and as far away as Miami. A tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica, or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. A tsunami threat alert was lifted Tuesday afternoon, a few hours after the quake. Alec Pultr, who lives in Ogier, Grand Cayman, said it wasn't the first earthquake he's experienced but it was the biggest ""by far."" ""We were simply working and things started to sway,"" he told CNN. As the swaying and shaking became more violent, most people started to run; the ones who stayed behind got under their desks. People in Miami, 440 miles from the epicenter, felt shaking. Miguel Charon was on the 13th floor of a building on Brickell Avenue. He told CNN he felt the walls shake for 30 to 40 seconds. His initial thought was that it must have been caused by a machine of some sort. He said building officials issued an evacuation order and people left the building in a smooth and calm manner. Jose Borrego, who also works in the Brickell area, said he was in a meeting. ""We felt slight movement of the building, then we got told to evacuate the building,"" he said. ""Once we came outside (we) noticed that there are evacuations every building in the area."" The earthquake appears to have been a ""strike-slip earthquake,"" in which tectonic plates slide against each other. This limits the threat of a devastating tsunami, which are more associated with ""thrust earthquakes,"" where a portion of the earth is thrust upward and causes the water to push up and outward, creating the tsunami. The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake had a preliminary depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). The quake hit 125 kilometers (77.6 miles) north-northwest of Lucea in Jamaica. The earthquake also was felt as far away as Havana. Some people in the Cuban capital were evacuating taller buildings. Cuba's state media reported the earthquake was felt across the island in Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, Holguín, Las Tunas, Cienfuegos, Pinar del Río, Havana and the Isle of Youth.

"Massive 7.7 magnitude earthquake centered between Cuba, Jamaica",2020-01-28 19:45 UTC,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/01/28/massive-73-magnitude-earthquake-centered-between-cuba-jamaica/,"Roy Ramos, Reporter Jeff Tavss, Executive Producer   Roy Ramos, Reporter Jeff Tavss, Executive Producer MIAMI – People all over Miami say they felt buildings swaying after a massive earthquake measuring 7.7 magnitude was centered between the island nations of Cuba and Jamaica on Tuesday.  A tsunami warning was not issued for any region, and the National Weather Service’s initial warning of waves up to 3 feet above tide level possible for Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Belize, Honduras and the Cayman Islands has expired. Miami City Commissioner Ken Russell says those in eight buildings in the Brickell and downtown areas self-evacuated and the building department was onsite. The Stephen P. Clark Government Center has been closed as a precaution. All Miami-Dade County courthouses have been evacuated and are expected to resume normal operations Wednesday. City of Miami Fire Rescue, with the help of engineers, deployed a drone in the Brickell area to search for cracks in concrete or any broken windows.  Russell deployed crews to survey more than a dozen affected buildings throughout the city. The Miami-Dade Emergency Operations Center was already activated due to the Super Bowl, but is now adding additional agencies to deal with the earthquake and infrastructure in South Florida. Video from a Local 10 News viewer in Aventura showed the window shaking from side to side as the quake was felt in their home on the 30th floor of the Mystic Pointe apartments. Roy Stein, who lives on the 32nd floor of 1060 Brickell, said he saw all the commotion from his balcony and went outside to find out what was happening. “I spoke to somebody. He said the building moved,” Stein said. “I go, ‘What do you mean the building moved?’ And then after I spoke to a few other people and went online, I read about an earthquake in Cuba and that’s when I put two and two together and figured we had an earthquake, or it was at least felt here in Miami.” Stein said he lived in California for 33 years and isn’t concerned about going back inside his building, but he spoke to some inside the nearby Bank of America building who said they saw doors slam shut. “I think the 49ers have done this to get the home-field advantage in the Super Bowl,” he said, alluding to the upcoming Super Bowl in South Florida between San Francisco and the Kansas City Chiefs. Hundreds of workers could be seen standing outside the Datran Center in the Dadeland area after evacuating the building, with police officers blocked traffic outside the buildings. Tenants at the Miami Tower in downtown spoke with the city of Miami hotline to report the building’s movement, but did not evacuate. Here is the latest from the @CityofMiami EOC regarding the effects felt in #Miami related to the 7.7 magnitude #earthquake that hit near Cuba and Jamaica. pic.twitter.com/4rtkrFsKOV Patrick Oppmann of CNN reports Cuban state media claims the earthquake was all across the island, with some of Havana’s taller buildings being evacuated. No damage has yet been reported in the country. The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands see so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. ""'It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,""' Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.” Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she had seen manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage. A 7.7 magnitude earthquake is considered a major earthquake that can cause serious damage. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Copyright 2020 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.

Cavs’ Cedi Osman to raise money for victims of deadly earthquake in Turkey,2020-01-25 17:29 UTC,https://fox8.com/2020/01/25/cavs-cedi-osman-to-raise-money-for-victims-of-deadly-earthquake-in-turkey/,"Fox 8 Cleveland WJW Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       CLEVELAND, Ohio (WJW/AP) – Cedi Osman of the Cleveland Cavaliers says he will raise money for victims of Turkey’s deadly earthquake at Saturday’s game at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. He says for every 3-point shot in the game, he will donate $100. Tonight I will donate 100 USD to the victims of earthquake in Elazığ, Turkey for every 3 points shot made by Cleveland Cavaliers and Chicago Bulls. Come on guys show what we can do together! @Cavs @chicagobulls @Kizilay — Cedi Osman (@cediosman) January 25, 2020 24-year-old Osman is of Turkish descent and a member of the Turkish national basketball team. The Cavs host the Chicago Bulls at 8 p.m. The death toll from a strong earthquake that rocked eastern Turkey climbed to 22 on Saturday as rescue crews searched for people who remained trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, officials said. Speaking at a televised news conference near the epicenter of the quake in Elazig province, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said 18 people were killed in Elazig and four in neighboring Malatya. Some 1,103 people were injured, with 34 of them in intensive care but not in critical condition, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the funeral of a mother and son killed in the quake while visiting the hardest-hit areas. He warned people against repeating “negative” hearsay about the country being unprepared for earthquakes. “Do not listen to rumors, do not listen to anyone’s negative, contrary propaganda, and know that we are your servants,” Erdogan said.  It was followed by 398 aftershocks, the strongest of them with magnitudes 5.4 and 5.1, the disaster agency said. Emergency workers and security forces distributed tents, beds and blankets as overnight temperatures dropped below freezing in the affected areas. Mosques, schools, sports halls and student dormitories were opened for hundreds who left their homes after the quake. “The earthquake was very severe. We desperately ran out (of our home),” Emre Gocer told the state-run Anadolu news agency as he sheltered with his family at a sports hall in Sivrice. “We don’t have a safe place to stay right now.” Erdogan on Saturday afternoon visited Sirvice and the city of Elazig, the provincial capital located some 565 kilometers (350 miles) east of Ankara. The Turkish leader promised state support for those affected by the disaster. “We will not leave anyone in the open,” he said. Earlier, a prosecutor in the capital Ankara announced an investigation into “provocative” social media posts. The Anadolu news agency reported that Turkey’s broadcasting authority was also reviewing media coverage of the quake. At least five buildings in Sivrice and 25 in Malatya province were destroyed in the disaster, Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said. Hundreds of other structures were damaged and made unsafe. AFAD reported that 42 people had been rescued as search teams combed wrecked apartment buildings. Television footage showed emergency workers removing a woman from the wreckage of a collapsed building 19 hours after the main earthquake struck. A prison in Adiyaman, 110 kilometers (70 miles) southwest of the epicenter, was evacuated due to damage its more than 800 prisoners transferred to nearby jails. AFAD said 28 rescue teams had been working around the clock. More than 2,600 personnel from 39 of Turkey’s 81 provinces were sent to the disaster site. Unmanned drones were used to survey damaged neighborhoods and coordinate rescue efforts. “Our biggest hope is that the death toll does not rise,” Parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop said. Communication companies announced free telephone and internet services for residents in the quake-hit region. Neighboring Greece, which is at odds with Turkey over maritime boundaries and gas exploration rights, offered to send rescue crews to assist the Turkish teams. Erdogan appeared to reject the offer of outside assistance during his visit to the city of Elazig, telling reporters, “Our state does not need anything.” Turkey sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent. Two strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey in 1999, killing around 18,000 people. A magnitude 6 earthquake killed 51 people in Elazig in 2010.

(WKYT) - An earthquake hit along the Kentucky-Tennessee border Monday afternoon. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) says the epicenter was near Fincastle, Tenn. The agency upgraded the magnitude of the quake to a 3.8 Monday afternoon. The earthquake could be felt in Williamsburg, Middlesboro, and Corbin, Ky. A 2.8 magnitude earthquake struck in the same area on Sunday. USGS says most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains has infrequent earthquakes. If you felt the earthquake click here to report it to the USGS. The Kentucky Geological Survey says earthquakes occur frequently in Kentucky but go unfelt most of the time.

"Earthquake activity will likely decrease in Puerto Rico, but chance remains for another strong quake",2020-01-15 13:47 UTC,https://www.kgun9.com/news/national/earthquake-activity-will-likely-decrease-in-puerto-rico-but-chance-remains-for-another-strong-quake,"Menu  On Monday, scientists at the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) 
released the latest earthquake forecast for Puerto Rico.

    

   While the most likely scenario shows decreased activity, there is still a chance of another major earthquake striking in the next seven days. “According to our forecast, over the [next week,] there is a 4 percent chance of one or more aftershocks that are larger than magnitude 6.4,” the USGS said. “It is likely that there will be smaller earthquakes over the [next week,] with 40 to 230 magnitude-3 or higher aftershocks. Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily.” The uncertainty in the ground below their feet has thousands of Puerto Ricans sleeping outside. “We don’t know if there is going to be any other quake big enough to do additional damage or bigger than what we’ve seen so far,” said Jochen Braunmiller, a seismologist and research faculty member at the University of South Florida. “I was a little surprised about the actual location of those earthquakes because they are not happening right at the plate boundary between the North American and the Caribbean plate,” Braunmiller said. “They are happening close to the island and above the plate boundary.” Braunmiller said the quakes are hitting in a deformed zone near the upper crust. If the location of the earthquake changes, it could be catastrophic for the island. “The worst-case scenario for Puerto Rico would be a subduction zone earthquake on the order of magnitude 7.5 or 8,” Braunmiller said. “I don’t think from historical data earthquakes have been much bigger than that. It would take out a lot of infrastructure for Puerto Rico for quite a while.” The USGS is continually updating their forecast 
page.

 Braunmiller understands why people in Puerto Rico are terrified. No one can predict what happens next. “It’s a dangerous place,” Braunmiller said. “Each time you go up one magnitude level, you actually are releasing 30 times more energy. If you live in the Southwest part of the island, if you have an opportunity to maybe temporarily live with friends or family closer to the northern part of the island.” This story was originally published by Michael Paluska on

"10 Years Later, Haiti Earthquake Survivor Triumphs Over Tragedy",2020-01-11 08:34 UTC,https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/10-years-later-haiti-earthquake-survivor-triumphs-over-tragedy/2175705/,"Ten years ago, a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake ravaged Haiti, killing more than 300,000 people and injuring more than 1.5 million others.  “There were bodies stacked on top of each other,” recalled Camille Federline, who was just 11 years old on Jan. 12, 2010 when the earthquake struck. Federline, who was badly hurt while running for safety on
the island, remembers the feeling of being afraid that a building would
collapse on top of her while she was there on the ground.    When Federline was finally able to see a doctor, an x-ray
revealed that her injury required surgery due a broken hip bone. However, surgical
equipment was not readily available, so Federline was transported to Miami for
treatment.  Doctors at Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital were able to
save her leg, but Federline spent the next year using a wheelchair and was
unable to attend school.  “I remember crying about it all the time,” Federline recalled. “Being in a wheelchair, I’m someone who loved playing coming from Haiti. That was a very difficult moment for me.""   Federline says she was inspired by the care she received when
she was a child, so she is now majoring in biochemistry and molecular biology
with an eye toward one day becoming a pediatric oncologist.  After living in the U.S. for 10 years, Federline says she
appreciates that her life in the U.S. is significantly different than the one
she left behind in Haiti.  “People are getting killed and there’s just so many things
going on where people can’t leave their house and people can’t get jobs,”
Federline said. “They don’t know when food is going to be on their table.”    Regardless, she remains hopeful for a positive outcome. “My leg was the ticket for me to get here. This had to
happen. That scary moment, that near-death experience taught me to really
appreciate life, appreciate the things that I have. The family that I have, the

The quake is the strongest and likely the most damaging of hundreds of temblors that have struck the island since December 28. It hit during the predawn hours Tuesday, leaving a man dead and causing dozens of homes and structures to crumble. It was centered just off Puerto Rico’s southern coast, six miles south of Indios. Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with people to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks. Terrified of sleeping indoors as aftershocks rattled a region on edge, neighbors put mattresses in their front yards while others spent the night Tuesday under white tents and tarps. Riko Gonzalez and his parents were sleeping in their home in Yauco, near Indios, when the quake struck. They scurried out of the house as dishes tumbled to the kitchen floor, he said. Hundreds of aftershocks have hit the area in the past few days. “People are afraid to go to bed, to then be woken up to worse earthquakes than the day before,” Gonzalez said. The towns affected by earthquakes are Guanica, Guayanilla, Yauco and Ponce. Most of Puerto Rico is still without power as engineers work to restore it in phases. About 100,000 customers are back on the grid, Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced said. The system-wide power outage was reported after the Costa Sur power plant in Guayanilla suffered severe damage on Tuesday, the governor said. “We lost the largest plant in the entire system,” said Jose Ortiz, executive director of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority. Ortiz said power has been restored in most hospitals and crews are working to fully restore it by the weekend. In Ponce, a nursing home was evacuated and dozens of people in wheelchairs were waiting outside. Education officials announced classes won’t resume across the island until crews inspect all schools and confirm buildings are safe for students. The Agripina Seda School in Guanica suffered major damage Tuesday, including a partially-collapsed, three-story building. “Classes in the public school system won’t resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,” Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won’t return to the schools until further notice. The earthquakes come more than two years after Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory in September 2017. Many in southern Puerto Rico said the earthquakes’ damage was worse. There’s no way to compare both disasters, Puerto Rico Police Commissioner Henry Escalera said. “There’s no warnings for this,” he said about the earthquakes. “A hurricane gives us time to plan ahead.” When asked about what concerns him the most about the aftermath of the earthquakes, he said, “It’s our homes … that homes will not be safe to live in and the possibility of a collapse that will cause a person’s death or serious injuries.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced aid has been made available to supplement local response efforts to the emergency conditions in the area. President Donald Trump’s action authorizes FEMA to coordinate all disaster relief efforts and provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures to save lives and protect property.

'Thought House Was Going To Fall': Roxborough Native Among Many Jarred By 6.4 Earthquake In Puerto Rico,2020-01-07 23:10 UTC,https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/01/07/thought-house-was-going-to-fall-roxborough-native-among-many-jarred-by-6-4-earthquake-in-puerto-rico/,"Watch CBS News

         PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- Another powerful earthquake rocked Puerto Rico, leaving at least one person dead and the island in a state of emergency. A young Roxborough native who is in Puerto Rico visiting, was among those jarred by the pre-dawn earthquake.  The 21-year-old was one of many tourists and residents jolted out of their sleep after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit the island of Puerto Rico just before dawn. ""Everything was shaking, I felt like my body was shaking, we were shaking,"" Adams said. ""I thought the house was going to fall down."" Adams is in Salinas, Puerto Rico, staying close to the beach. The Roxborough native, along with her boyfriend and his mother, Maria Setzler, scurried to a safe zone after a tsunami warning was issued. Setzler moved back to the island three months ago. ""The earthquakes, they do come pretty often. We do get them frequent, not as strong as this one this morning,"" she said. ""Since September, I've been through four earthquakes but this is the first one that I've actually felt."" ""We got up and moved out of town really quick because we're like five minutes away from water,"" Adams added. While the Salinas area was spared any significant damage, the town of Guayanilla did not escape the destruction caused by the earthquake. Many residents found themselves trapped in their homes. Some homes were reduced to rubble, crushing cars underneath. ""My power in my room here in Old San Juan is out,"" one person said. The power company cut power to the entire island just as a precaution. It's the second earthquake in as many days with a 5.8 magnitude quake hitting the day before. The United States Geological Survey says Puerto Rico's seismic activity is occurring along three faults on the island's southwest region. Adams is riding out the power outage on the beach. ""I did want to go home right away when it happened, but now I feel a lot calmer and at ease, so now I want to stay and enjoy the rest of it,"" Adams said. Nerves are still frayed as many on the island are still trying to pick up the pieces of their lives. For those traveling, American Airlines says there are no impacts to scheduled operations within their networks at San Juan's airport. Nonetheless, the airline is in the process of issuing a travel notice allowing customers to alter travel plans, without incurring any charge fees.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

A 6.4-magnitude earthquake hit Puerto Rico a day after another quake rocked the island,2020-01-07 10:55 UTC,https://myfox8.com/2020/01/07/a-6-4-magnitude-earthquake-hit-puerto-rico-a-day-after-another-quake-rocked-the-island/,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term.

Seismometer (Getty Images)    Seismometer (Getty Images)    A 6.4-magnitude earthquake rocked Puerto Rico early Tuesday morning, just one day after a 5.8 magnitude quake shook the island, according to the US Geological Survey.   Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority reported widespread outages across the island after its power plants activated an auto protective mechanism following the earthquake. Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced urged citizens to remain calm as the government responds to the most recent quake in a statement posted on Twitter. “I hope all are well. We are getting our information from @NMEADpr and @DSPnoticias,” the tweet said. “The entire government is active and in action. I ask our people to remain calm and urge you to remain safe.” No tsunami is expected following the earthquake, the US National Tsunami Warning Center said. The quake’s magnitude was adjusted slightly downward in the hours after it struck, after initially being recorded as a 6.6. Puerto Rico has experienced a flurry of earthquakes since December 28, according to data from the USGS, ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to Sunday’s 5.8. All of the earthquakes appear to have been foreshocks to the most recent quake, CNN Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. Geologists warned that more earthquakes, known as aftershocks and tremors, would follow Monday’s quake. “When there are more earthquakes, the chance of a large earthquake is greater which means that the chance of damage is greater,” the USGS said. On Monday, the early morning quake in the same area caused some damage, including rock slides and a home collapse in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, Director of Emergency Management Carlos Acevedo said.

Earthquake Kills 7 in Croatia,2020-12-30 06:00 UTC,https://www.voanews.com/europe/earthquake-kills-7-croatia,"

 Rescue teams searched overnight after a strong earthquake in central Croatia killed at least seven people, injured more than 20 others and destroyed buildings. Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said late Tuesday officials expected the death toll to rise. The magnitude-6.4 earthquake hit the town of Petrinja the hardest. It came just a day after a magnitude-5.2 quake struck the same area. Many people spent Tuesday night outside, fearful of another earthquake striking already battered structures. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable,” Plenkovic said when he and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake. The army is assisting with rescue efforts, and Plenkovic said there were places for 500 people to sleep in barracks. Croatia’s Mountain Rescue Service said searchers aided by dogs had rescued six people from the rubble. The European Union is sending aid Wednesday with EU crisis management chief Janez Lenarcic set to visit Petrinja. ""At the moment, mostly winter tents, electric heaters, sleeping beds and sleeping bags are needed as well as housing containers,"" Lenarcic tweeted. Officials said the dead included a 12-year-old girl in Petrinja, a town of about 25,000 people. Six others died in surrounding villages, while 26 people were hospitalized. The earthquake was felt as far away as Vienna, Austria, and neighboring Slovenia, which temporarily shut down its nuclear power plant as a precaution. Earthquakes are not uncommon in Croatia, but ones as strong as this have not been felt since the 1990s, when the village of Ston was destroyed. "

(KOLD News 13) - A strong earthquake hit central Croatia on Tuesday, causing considerable damage to homes and other buildings in a town southeast of Zagreb, the capital. The European Mediterranean Seismological Center said an earthquake of 6.3 magnitude hit 17 miles southeast of Zagreb. Initial reports said the earthquake caused wide damage, collapsing roofs, building facades and even some entire buildings. Video from Al Jazeera Balkans showed one of its correspondents reporting from the town of Petrinja, as the area is struck by an aftershock. Streets in the town were littered with fallen bricks and dust and many houses were completely destroyed.   The Croatian military was deployed in Petrinja to help with the rescue operation. Croatian media said people were injured by the quake, but could not initially say how many amid the confusion and downed phone lines. The same area was struck by a 5.2 quake on Monday.

Two of those hospitalized are in serious condition, authorities said.  The AP reported that the same area was hit by a 5.2 quake Monday. The U.S. Geological Survey called Tuesday’s natural disaster “the largest earthquake to occur in Croatia since the advent of modern seismic instrumentation,” adding that a similar-sized earthquake hit Zagreb in 1880.  The AP noted that while Croatia is prone to earthquakes as a Mediterranean country, large ones are rather rare, with the last strong quake destroying the Adriatic coast village of Ston in the 1990s.  Tuesday’s earthquake was felt throughout Croatia, as well as in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia and Slovenia, and as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government officials arrived in Petrinja on Tuesday following the quake, with Plenkovic saying in an address that “the biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable,” the AP reported.  The prime minister added that the country’s army has 500 places in barracks ready to house people, while others displaced by the quake will be allowed to stay at nearby hotels and other locations.  “No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” Plenkovic said, according to the AP.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen took to Twitter on Tuesday to announce that she had spoken with Plenkovic and had asked the commission’s head of crisis management to “stand ready to travel to Croatia as soon as the situation allows.”  After another powerful earthquake in Croatia, the 2nd in the past 2 days, I spoke with Prime Minister @AndrejPlenkovic again.

Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. Another six people were killed in nearly destroyed villages close to the town, according to HRT state television. At least 26 people were hospitalized, six with serious injuries, officials said, adding that many more people remained unaccounted for. In Petrinja, cries could be heard from underneath destroyed houses. One woman was found alive some four hours after the quake. Emergency teams used rescue dogs in the search for survivors, while family members looked on in despair. “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT. “This is like Hiroshima - half of the city no longer exists.” Firefighters worked to remove the debris from a collapsed building that fell on a car. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the vehicle and carried into an ambulance. The town was left without electricity or running water as officials scrambled to set up temporary accommodation for all of the displaced residents in need. Residents fearing another earthquake seemed poised to spend the night outside their homes. Petrinja resident Marica Pavlovic said the quake felt “worse than a war.” “It was horrible, a shock. You don’t know what to do, whether to run out or hide somewhere,” she told The Associated Press.

Officials also toured a damaged hospital in the nearby town of Sisak, which was also badly hit. Plenkovic said the patients will be evacuated in army helicopters and ambulances. Health officials said a baby was delivered in a tent in front of the hospital in the aftermath of the earthquake. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that she spoke with Plenkovic and instructed an envoy to travel to Croatia as soon as possible. As a Mediterranean country, Croatia is prone to earthquakes, but not big ones. The last strong quake struck in the 1990s when the picturesque Adriatic coast village of Ston was destroyed. The Croatian military was deployed in the quake-hit region to help with the rescue operation. Croatian seismologist Kresimir Kuk described the earthquake as “extremely strong,” far stronger than another one that hit Zagreb and nearby areas in the spring. He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky old buildings and move to newer areas of the city because of aftershocks. In the capital, people ran into the streets in fear. The earthquake was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia and Slovenia. It was felt as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported.

"Homeowners should check for potential damage following recent earthquake, expert says",2020-11-09 23:30 UTC,https://www.wpri.com/community/environment/homeowners-should-check-for-potential-damage-following-recent-earthquake-expert-says/,"WPRI.com Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.     PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) ─ Residents across Southern New England woke up to the ground shaking Sunday morning when a 3.6 magnitude earthquake struck Buzzards Bay, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Dr. John Ebel, a research scientist at Weston Observatory, said the earthquake was felt as far up as southern New Hampshire and as far west as Hartford, Connecticut. The New Bedford Fire Department is advised anyone who felt the earthquake to check their gas lines, furnace and smokestack for potential damage and make sure they have a working carbon monoxide detector. If there’s no apparent damage, Vice President of Home and Commercial services with GEM Plumbing Joseph Andrade said homeowners should conduct a visual inspection to make sure nothing has shifted or moved out of place. “Any of the gas piping, or anything to do with the piping of the household, check to make sure nothing has broken and there’s nothing leaking,” Andrade said. Andrade said homeowners that smell a gas-like odor should vacate immediately and call 911. “I would call the authorities to shut it down and basically have a licensed professional go in and take a look at it and make the repairs,” he said. 12 News has learned National Grid inspected its gas and electric systems across Rhode Island and Massachusetts soon after Sunday’s earthquake. No damage was reported. Andrade said another sign to look for is a change in water pressure. “Sometimes you can hear water leaking, you can see water leakin, or something under the ground is pinched or broken off,” he said. “Homeowners will notice a drop in water pressure.” In case another earthquake hits the region in the near future, Andrade suggested ensuring that all pipes are properly secured and equipment is fastened down to prevent further damage.

Strongest earthquake since 1976 shakes southern New England,2020-11-09 01:55 UTC,https://www.thewesterlysun.com/news/westerly/strongest-earthquake-since-1976-shakes-southern-new-england/article_b8a53e60-222b-11eb-9362-3b98a337853b.html," Rain showers early will evolve into a more steady rain overnight. Low 51F. Winds ESE at 10 to 20 mph. Chance of rain 90%. Rainfall near an inch.   BOSTON — The strongest earthquake to hit southern New England in decades rattled homes and nerves Sunday morning, but didn’t cause any significant damage, authorities said. The 3.6 magnitude earthquake centered off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts, in Buzzards Bay struck just after 9 a.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Earthquake Information Center. The earthquake hit at a depth of a little more than 9.3 miles and was felt across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and into Connecticut and Long Island, New York. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a magnitude 3.5 temblor hit in March 1976, said Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist. About 14,000 people went to the agency’s website to report the earthquake, including people from Easthampton, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut, both about 100 miles away, and several from more than 50 miles away in Boston, he said. That’s not unusual in New England. “It’s common for them to be felt very far away because the rock here is old and continuous and transmits the energy a long way,” Caruso said. Ali Kenner Brodsky, who lives in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, not far from the epicenter, was sitting in her kitchen talking with her son, when it hit. “It was a rumbling. It sounded like something exploded. It rumbled. The whole house shook,” she said. She said it lasted around 10 to 15 seconds. “In that moment, it feels like it’s going on forever.” Her husband, Sam, ran to the basement because he thought the boiler blew up. Magnitude 3.6 earthquakes rarely cause major damage, Caruso said. Chris Besse, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said it had not received any reports of significant damage. There were some reports of minor damage. Police in Fall River tweeted that they received numerous phone calls about the quake, including reports of items falling off of shelves, and street signs getting uprooted.      Keep it Clean.

Little girl rescued from rubble after 65 hours in Turkey as earthquake death toll hits 91,2020-11-02 23:16 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/11/02/little-girl-rescued-rubble-after-hours-turkey-earthquake-death-toll-hits/,"IZMIR, TURKEY (CBS News) - Frantic search and rescue efforts continued Monday in Turkey’s western city of Izmir, with the rescue of a little girl from the destruction caused by an earthquake three days earlier providing a glimmer of hope.  But the toll was devastating; the magnitude 7.0 earthquake that struck on Friday morning had officially claimed at least 91 lives by Monday. Almost 900 more were injured, and many people were still missing. Rescuers were still racing to reach survivors trapped under the rubble of five different apartment blocks in Izmir on Monday. Dozens of people remained missing, local rescue agencies said, and family members gathered around the crumbled buildings hoping for any sign of loved ones. Rescue workers managed to pull a 3-year-old girl out of one levelled building, saving her after she was left trapped under rubble for 65 hours. Elif Perincek became stuck with her three siblings and her mother in their family home when the quake struck. Her mother and twin sisters were rescued earlier, but her 7-year-old brother died. Video on Turkish television showed rescue workers and TV reporters shedding tears of joy when the little girl was pulled from the crumbled concrete on Monday. But the agonizing wait continued for many other families. Yesim Emir, a 29-year-old dentist, was believed to be stuck under a collapsed 8-storey building. Fighting back tears, her mother Sibel Suruc told CBS News on Saturday that the family was clinging to hope, “praying she will come out alive.” At least 106 people had been pulled out of the rubble alive by Monday, but there was still no sign of Emir. The country’s Disaster and Relief Agency said more than 5,700 personnel from state and local government agencies and civil society groups had joined the rescue efforts. Rescue workers were taking significant risks, sliding through cracks and climbing over of crushed concrete and steel of demolished buildings to reach survivors. Burak Galip Akkurt was among them. He said survivors of past disasters had been found alive even after five days buried under debris. “We never give up hope. It is for the team, but also those who are waiting outside,” he said. There were lucky escapes when the quake struck, as well. Zeki Soysal watched the building where he had a shop partially crumble in front of his eyes. He said he didn’t care that he had lost his business and was “just grateful to be alive.” More than 5,000 people were stuck living in tents, as at least 58 buildings had either collapsed or been critically damaged. Many residents were simply too fearful to return to their homes amid strong aftershocks. More than 1,000 aftershocks had been recorded by Monday following the initial temblor on Friday. Schools in the city were to remain closed all week. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to “heal the wounds” of the disaster before winter arrived. Emergency accommodation in the form of a shipping container city was being built to accommodate at least 1,000 people. The epicenter of the quake was in the Aegean Sea, roughly 10 miles off the Turkish coast. The most severe damage occurred in Izmir, but two teenagers on Greece’s Samos Island were also killed. Turkey sits on active fault lines and has experienced major earthquakes in the past. A magnitude 7.5 earthquake killed more than 17,000 people in 1999. Friday’s earthquake struck as Turkey was already struggling to cope with a rising number of COVID-19 cases. Health minister Fahrettin Koca said he understood the difficulty of practicing social distancing in crowded tents and other temporary relief centers, but he still warned of the coronavirus threat. “We urge all our citizens to continue carrying out precautions against the coronavirus pandemic,” he said. “We cannot give in to the pandemic while we deal with the aftermath of the earthquake.” Copyright 2020 CBS Interactive Inc.

Three-year-old girl rescued alive after 65 hours trapped under rubble in Turkey earthquake,2020-11-02 16:45 UTC,https://www.wcvb.com/article/three-year-old-girl-rescued-alive-after-65-hours-trapped-under-rubble-in-turkey-earthquake/34546965,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. A three-year-old girl has been rescued alive from a collapsed apartment building in Izmir, Turkey, following Friday's strong earthquake, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu. The child, identified by authorities as Elif Perincek, was rescued on Monday morning, more than 65 hours after the devastating quake struck. The Turkish health minister Fahrettin Koca said Perincek's mother and two others were rescued earlier, but unfortunately one of her siblings had died. Koca said later on Monday that the three-year-old had been taken to hospital and was being treated in intensive care. He said she had not sustained any serious fractures or muscle crush injuries and was in good condition. News of the rescue came just hours after another child was found alive under the rubble and safely brought to the surface by rescue teams. Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority said that 14-year-old Idil Sirin was rescued after she had spent more than 58 hours trapped under a collapsed building.  In phone video showing the dramatic moment of Sirin's rescue, dozens of onlookers are heard cheering excitedly as she is freed from the wreckage. She was given first aid at the scene before being transported to a local hospital, according to Anadolu. At least 91 people died and 994 were injured after the earthquake — measured as magnitude-7.0 by the U.S. Geological Survey — struck in the Aegean Sea Friday, shaking parts of Greece and Turkey. The quake struck 8.7 miles northeast of the town of Néon Karlovásion on Samos, the USGS reported, at a relatively shallow depth of 13 miles, making its impact powerfully felt at ground level around the epicenter. A total of 20 buildings were seriously damaged in Izmir by the tremor, according to Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer, the majority of them in the middle-class Bayrakli district. More than 900 aftershocks have been registered since the initial quake, 42 of them with a magnitude over 4.0, Turkey's disaster agency said. The earthquake also triggered what authorities called a ""mini tsunami,"" causing streets to flood Friday in parts of Turkey's wider Izmir province, as well as on Samos.

"Strong Magnitude 6.6 Earthquake Hits Aegean Sea, Topples Buildings in Turkey",2020-10-30 13:21 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/strong-magnitude-7-0-earthquake-hits-aegean-sea-topples-buildings-in-turkey_3558743.html,"ISTANBUL—Fourteen people were killed in Turkey and Greece after a strong earthquake struck the Aegean Sea on Friday, bringing buildings crashing down and setting off tidal waves which slammed into coastal areas and islands. People ran onto streets in panic in the Turkish city of Izmir, witnesses said, after the quake struck with a magnitude of up to 7.0. Neighbourhoods were deluged with surging seawater which swept debris inland and left fish stranded as it receded. Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) said 12 people died, one due to drowning, while 419 people were injured. On the Greek island of Samos two teenagers, a boy and a girl, were found dead in an area where a wall had collapsed. Search and rescue operations continued at 17 collapsed or damaged buildings, AFAD said. Izmir’s governor said 70 people had been rescued from under the rubble. Ilke Cide, a doctoral student who was in Izmir’s Guzelbahce region during the earthquake, said he went inland after waters rose following the earthquake. “I am very used to earthquakes… so I didn’t take it very seriously at first but this time it was really scary,” he said, adding the earthquake had lasted for at least 25-30 seconds. Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Turkey is among the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. More than 17,000 people were killed in August 1999 when a 7.6 magnitude quake struck Izmit, a city southeast of Istanbul. In 2011, a quake in the eastern city of Van killed more than 500. Ismail Yetiskin, mayor of Izmir’s Seferihisar, said sea levels rose as a result of the quake. “There seems to be a small tsunami,” he told broadcaster NTV. Footage on social media showed debris including refrigerators, chairs and tables floating through streets on the deluge. TRT Haber showed cars in Izmir’s Seferihisar district had been dragged by the water and piled on top of each other. Idil Gungor, who runs a hotel in Izmir’s Seferihisar district, told broadcaster NTV that people were cleaning the debris after the floodwaters receded. She said fish had washed up on the garden of the hotel, around 50 metres from the shore. Residents of the Greek island of Samos, which has a population of about 45,000, were urged to stay away from coastal areas, Eftyhmios Lekkas, head of Greece’s organisation for anti-seismic planning, told Greece’s Skai TV. “It was a very big earthquake, it’s difficult to have a bigger one,” said Lekkas. High tidal wave warnings were in place in Samos, where eight people were also injured, according to a Greek official. “We have never experienced anything like it,” said George Dionysiou, the local vice-mayor. “People are panicking.” A Greek police spokesman said there was damage to some old buildings on the island. The leaders of Turkey and Greece—caught up in a bitter dispute over exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean—spoke by phone and expressed hopes that both countries would see a speedy recovery from the quake, Turkey’s presidency said. President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was ready to help Greece if necessary, it added. Earlier, their foreign ministers spoke and said they were ready to help one another, Ankara said. Cooperation between the two countries after the devastating 1999 earthquake led to a period of warmer ties between them. AFAD put the magnitude of the earthquake at 6.6, while the U.S. Geological Survey said it was 7.0. It was felt along Turkey’s Aegean coast and the northwestern Marmara region, media said.

The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.9, with an epicenter 8.1 miles north northeast of the Greek island of Samos. The United States Geological Survey put the magnitude at 7.0. Turkish media showed wreckage of a multiple-story building in central Izmir, with people climbing it to reach rescuers. Smoke was filmed in several spots in central Izmir. The governor said there was no immediate information on casualties. Turkish media said the earthquake was felt across the regions of Aegean and Marmara, where Istanbul is located. Istanbul’s governor said there were no reports of damage. The quake was felt across the eastern Greek islands and even in the Greek capital Athens.

7.5-magnitude earthquake near Alaska generates small tsunami,2020-10-19 23:57 UTC,https://www.wvtm13.com/article/tsunami-warning-issued-after-75-magnitude-earthquake-near-alaska/34418931,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. The magnitude 7.5 earthquake near Sand Point, Alaska, generated a tsunami, Scott Langley with the National Tsunami Warning Center said Monday afternoon. Langley said the tsunami sent two waves, each measuring 4 feet, 3 inches high. But observers onshore reported the waves appeared to be 1.5 feet and 2 feet over high tide. The center is monitoring harbors in a 500-mile area along the Alaska coastline, he said. Tsunami advisories issued for parts of Alaska and the state of Hawaii following the earthquake were canceled Monday night, according to tweets from the National Weather Service Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (NWS PTWC). Langley said earlier the area in Alaska that had been subject to the warning and advisory is ""pretty remote."" ""For other US and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America, there is no tsunami threat,"" the center said. The earthquake's epicenter was recorded less than 60 miles from Sand Point, near the Aleutian Peninsula in the southwestern part of the state. ""We did feel it,"" Sand Point Clinic employee Lorna Osterback said of the quake. ""This is a big one."" Osterback said residents of the town would be heading to higher ground away from the shoreline as they wait out the tsunami threat. ""We expect we will have another one in about half an hour,"" noted Osterback. ""We're right on the fault line. I grew up here and it's kind of normal."" Jeanette Piniones Navales moved her family from Kodiak Island to higher ground on Pillar Mountain when the tsunami alerts sounded Monday. She said she has lived in Kodiak since 2014 and this is her sixth time experiencing a tsunami warning. ""I got nervous and immediately convinced my family to move (to) high ground to be safe,"" she told CNN. Candace Nelson, her kids and dogs hid under the table as the earthquake shook Cold Bay, about 90 miles west of Sand Point. ""My kids are all doing good. Brooke, Wilder and Scout all huddled under our kitchen table till the shaking stopped,"" she told CNN as the family waited for more news about the tsunami. ""The dogs were more concerned as to what the heck we were doing under the table."" Residents of Homer could also be seen driving to higher ground after being given evacuation orders. Several aftershocks, including one with a magnitude of 5.9 and one that was 5.8, struck in the hour after the big quake.

Please enter a search term.       SAND POINT, Alaska (KSEE/KGPE) — A preliminary 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck near Alaska on Monday, triggering a tsunami warning. The quake struck in the North Pacific Ocean just before 1 p.m. It was centered about 67 miles (118 kilometers) southeast of Sand Point. The community is about 800 miles (1,288 km) southwest of Anchorage. The quake was recorded at a depth of 19 miles (30 kilometers). Raynelle Gardner, a secretary at Sand Point School in the Aleutians East Borough School District, said things are hectic because “this is an evacuation point.” Some schools in the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District were evacuating to higher ground, the district said on Twitter. The tsunami warning was issued by the National Tsunami Warning Center, following an earthquake off Sand Point, Alaska. The size of the quake was originally reported to have been a magnitude of 7.4, but was revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said an earthquake of this size, in this area, is not a surprise. “This is an area where the Pacific Plate is subducting underneath the North American Plate. And because of that, the Pacific Plate actually goes underneath the North American Plate, where it melts,” Caruso said, noting that’s why there are volcanoes in the region. “And so we commonly have large, magnitude 7 earthquakes in that area.” The National Weather Service posted a tsunami warning for parts of the Alaska coastline, from Kennedy Entrance, 40 miles southwest of Homer, to Unimak Pass, 80 miles northeast of Unalaska.   If you are located in this coastal area, move inland to higher ground. Tsunami warnings mean that a tsunami with significant inundation is possible or is already occurring. Tsunamis are a series of waves dangerous many hours after initial arrival time. The first wave may not be the largest. At 1255 PM Alaska Daylight Time on October 19 an earthquake with preliminary magnitude 7.5 occurred 55 miles southeast of Sand Point Alaska. Estimated tsunami start times for selected sites are; Sand Point Alaska 155 PM. AKDT. October 19. Cold Bay Alaska 245 PM. AKDT. October 19. Kodiak Alaska 250 PM. AKDT. October 19. The tsunami warning will remain in effect until further notice. Refer to the internet site tsunami.gov for more information. Unalaska officials sent out a message saying the city is just outside the warning zone and they aren’t ordering evacuations right now. Unalaska public safety officials earlier Monday had sent out a release saying they would be conducting tests of the community’s tsunami warning sirens. The center said the quake was widely felt in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula. The Alaska Earthquake Center said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. “It was a pretty good shaker here,” said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. “We’re doing OK.” He said all guests were accounted for and “the structure itself is sound.”  Rita Tungul, front desk assistant at the Grand Aleutian Hotel in Unalaska, said she felt some shaking but it wasn’t strong. Her coworker didn’t feel the quake at all, she said. Connie Newton, owner of the Bearfoot Inn, a grocery store, liquor store and small hotel in Cold Bay, said the temblor it felt like someone drove into her building with a truck. Still, nothing fell to the ground and she suffered no damage because she earthquake-proofed her stores by installing 2-inch (5-cm) risers around the outside of her selves.

And because of that, the Pacific Plate actually goes underneath the North American Plate, where it melts,"" Caruso said, noting that's why there are volcanoes in the region. ""And so we commonly have large, magnitude 7 earthquakes in that area."" Public safety officials in King Cove sent out an alert urging residents in the coastal area to move inland to higher ground. Some schools in the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District were evacuating to higher ground, the district said on Twitter. The tsunami warning was issued by the National Tsunami Warning Center, following an earthquake off Sand Point, Alaska. The National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, said the tsunami warning was in effect for roughly 950 miles (1,529 kilometers), from 40 miles (64 kilometers) southeast of Homer to Unimak Pass, about 80 miles (129 km) northeast of Unalaska. The Alaska Earthquake Center said the quake was widely felt in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula. The Alaska Earthquake Center said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. ""It was a pretty good shaker here,"" said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. ""We're doing OK."" He said all guests were accounted for and ""the structure itself is sound.""  Rita Tungul, front desk assistant at the Grand Aleutian Hotel in Unalaska, said she felt some shaking but it wasn't strong. Her coworker didn't feel the quake at all, she said. Unalaska officials sent out a message saying the city is just outside the warning zone and they aren't ordering evacuations right now. Unalaska public safety officials earlier Monday had sent out a release saying they would be conducting tests of the community's tsunami warning sirens.

Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C.—Sparta has less than 2,000 residents, but it’s been the talk of the east coast after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake shook the town and its surroundings on Sunday morning.  On Monday, people were holding off on clean up and assessing the damage caused by the natural disaster in hopes of documenting it for future financial assistance.  For a lot of people in North Carolina, earthquakes are not covered under what’s called the “umbrella clause” for natural disasters.  Sparta Mayor Wes Brinegar said the state of emergency was called so they can apply for FEMA and state financial aid.  The VFW is one of those businesses that’s going to need quite a bit of assistance.  “It’s kind of heartbreaking to see this history destroyed by an earthquake like this,” Brinegar said.  The Post Commander, Gary Adkins, is hoping this wont stop the positive momentum the post had already started prior to the natural disaster.   He described the damages the building sustained.  “Here the ceiling is falling in on us and several tiles are falling out on the back side,” he said.  The jolt started in Sparta and was felt throughout the Piedmont Triad all the way to Atlanta. “I thought bomb. I thought maybe something exploded — gas explosion or something. It was just so loud,” Clark Hunter, VFW Post 7034 member said.  The 5.1 magnitude earthquake caused severe damage to homes and businesses in Sparta. The VFW was less than a mile from its epicenter.  “It (the earthquake) opened up all the drawers. It knocked microwaves off the counters. All dishes came out of the drawers,” Adkins explained.  “Our local VFW…sustained probably some of the most severe damages that we had,” Brinegar said.  Mayor Brinegar is a veteran and member of this post. He became emotional when talking about the post’s significance to the town.  “One of our most historic buildings here in the county. It’s been here since WWII,” he said.  There was also significant damage to the Kathy Shore Tree Nursery.  Owner Kathy shore has owned the building for about a decade, and seeing it like this was devastating to walk into Monday morning.  “We have found out that the earthquake is less than a mile from here. So this evidently took a direct hit,” she said.  Shore said it’s going to cost more than a couple hundred thousand dollars to fix all the damages.  It’s another hurdle after the pandemic threatened the businesses on her property.  “We had been shutdown for a while. We had reopened and business was doing very well. It was booming up here,” Shore said. “We had lots of regulations set in place, and people seem to be following it. And everything was back open and going well until this hit.”   A lot of people are reaching out to the business asking if they can help. But all the places FOX8 spoke to say they are waiting for insurance inspectors to asses the situation before they begin clean up.  The VFW and Kath’s Nursery are places that may need some rebuilding or renovating at the least. The question now is how?  “Right now, to our knowledge, this is not covered by any kind of insurance policies, so it has to be a specific thing. So we’re going to have a lot of people looking for a lot of help,” Brinegar said.  While this organization is leaving everything how it is so inspectors can take a look at the damages, picking up the pieces is something members at Post 7034 won’t have to do alone.  VFW State Commander Victor Letourneaut drove the more than 5 hours from Jacksonville, North Carolina to make sure his brothers in arms could feel the support after a devastating 24-hours.  “That’s the stuff that we do. Someone’s down, you’re always going to get people come back and reinforce you,” Letourneaut said. “Moral support. Financial support…right now it’s moral support, making sure everything is good to go. No one got hurt. That’s the great thing. Everything else we can rebuild,” he said.  Letournet said VFW members across the state have reached out saying they are willing and ready to assist this post when the time comes. Meantime, this post is hoping to get financial aid through the National VFW chapter.  Another thing that brings concern are the aftershocks of the initial earthquake.   While this natural disaster has put Sparta on the map, the mayor hopes people know this community is still standing strong together.  “Our people are the best people. People have come out and checked on each other…I’m so pleased and so honored to be the mayor of Sparta,” he said.  The mayor is encouraging all residents to send in photos of structural damages to emergency management.

Roads also cracked. The USGS warned people in the Southeastern states to be aware of a “possibility of aftershocks especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings.”   — Chad Tucker (@ChadTucker) August 9, 2020   Earthquake damage from Sparta. pic.twitter.com/2L2vT8wk9g — Chad Tucker (@ChadTucker) August 9, 2020  The earthquake was the sixth in the area in slightly more than 24 hours, after several foreshocks, with the second-largest occurring about two miles south of Sparta and reaching a 2.6 magnitude.  The quake was the highest magnitude to hit North Carolina since 1926, when Mitchell County in the western part of the state experienced a 5.2 magnitude earthquake.

5.1 Magnitude Earthquake Rattles Parts of North Carolina: USGS,2020-08-09 14:45 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/5-1-magnitude-earthquake-rattles-parts-of-north-carolina-usgs_3455222.html,"A 5.1 magnitude earthquake shook parts of North Carolina and several other states in the southeastern United States on Aug. 9, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The National Weather Service, citing the USGS, wrote that the “5.1 magnitude earthquake near Sparta, NC, this morning is the second strongest earthquake to occur in NC since 1900.” It added, “The strongest was a 5.2 magntitude [sic] earthquake near Skyland, NC, in February 1916.” The USGS’s website suggested that a number of people in several states reported feeling the quake. “Since at least 1776, people living inland in North and South Carolina, and in adjacent parts of Georgia and Tennessee, have felt small earthquakes and suffered damage from infrequent larger ones. The largest earthquake in the area (magnitude 5.1) occurred in 1916,” said the USGS.  — USGS (@USGS) August 9, 2020  
It wasn’t immediately known if there were any injuries or damage.
Later, the USGS wrote that there is a chance that an aftershock will hit the region in the next week or so. A quake with a 3.0 magnitude or greater has a 57 percent chance of occurring, while a quake of 5.0 magnitude or greater has just a 5 percent chance of happening, the seismic agency said.
On Twitter, locals reported that they had felt the temblor.
“Yes, I felt it in Henderson County and already filled out the site survey. The focal mechanism shows NE-SW shortening,” one wrote.

The earthquake’s epicenter was in Allegheny County, North Carolina. The earthquake was also felt by those in southwest Virginia, Tennessee and as far south as Atlanta, Georgia. USGS has issued a green alert, meaning there’s a low likelihood of casualties and damage. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. It was the largest earthquake to hit North Carolina since 1916, when a magnitude 5.5 quake occurred near Skyland, the National Weather Service said. Earlier Sunday morning, the USGS reported a 2.6 magnitude earthquake close by in Sparta, North Carolina.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Numerous reports of shaking in southwest Virginia after earthquake in North Carolina,2020-08-09 12:42 UTC,https://www.wsls.com/weather/2020/08/09/numerous-reports-of-shaking-in-southwest-virginia-after-earthquake-in-north-carolina/,"See the complete list WEATHER ALERT Justin McKee, Meteorologist Taj Simmons, Reporter   Justin McKee, Meteorologist Taj Simmons, Reporter  It was the strongest quake in North Carolina in more than 100 years. There was a 5.2 magnitude earthquake reported near Skyland, NC in 1916. “I about fell off my bed. That’s how hard it hit,” said Sparta resident Jose Perez. “Everything started shaking. I started bouncing off of the bed, and then it stopped. It went on for 10 seconds before it stopped.” The seismograph at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg recorded the earthquake’s shaking. Once the shaking commenced, residents in Sparta witnessed the remnants of the earthquake’s force. Numerous roads in the city were split open, including well-traveled Route 21, and several homes and businesses experienced structural damage. “I cried for about 30 minutes this morning trying to clean up a bad mess,” said Scott Smith, whose Sparta-based landscaping and nursery business experienced cracking concrete and shattered items in the earthquake. “This is not about politics, coronavirus, or anything else. This is God showing you what he’s willing to do.” The earthquake even caught Alleghany County (NC) Sheriff Bryan Maines off-guard. “I actually woke up with the crashing of picture frames in my house.” Although the town experienced numerous reports of damage after the tremors, Maines said his office had not received any calls for serious injuries caused by the earthquake. “For the size and magnitude of this, it was not as bad as it could have been, so we’re really thankful,” Maines said. Smith said as long as everyone survived the earthquake, he can reminisce on the ten seconds that shook Sparta to its core. “My son on the way to town said, ‘Dad, what are we going to do?’” Smith said. “I told him, ‘You’re sitting next to me. Your mom and my daughter are beside me in the car. We’re going to be okay.’” The USGS says there are likely to be aftershocks this week, but only a four percent chance of anything stronger than Sunday morning’s earthquake. Students in Grayson County will not return to the classroom this week because of the earthquake. Classes will now start on Aug. 18 because of potential aftershocks.  If you felt the earthquake, you can report the shaking to the USGS here. If you’d like to learn more about earthquakes in Virginia, the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy has a great resource.

The quake sparked a tsunami warning for south Alaska and the Alaskan Peninsula, but the warning, as well as other advisories, were canceled later Wednesday morning, CNN reported. A wave of less than a foot was reported to have hit the state in Sand Point, The Associated Press reported.    — USGS (@USGS) July 22, 2020  Kodiak Police Sgt. Mike Sorter said early Wednesday that there were “no reports of any damage,” according to the AP. Kodiak is about 200 miles northeast of where the earthquake hit. “No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal,” he said. Small towns within 100 miles of the earthquake experienced strong shaking, and those near Anchorage — which is more than 500 miles away — reported some shaking, according to Michael West, an Alaska state seismologist.  The earthquake caused several people who live near the coast to evacuate to higher ground in anticipation of a potential tsunami as sirens blasted. Thrust earthquakes that reach high magnitudes and are categorized as shallow are more likely to produce tsunamis, with those between 7.6 and 7.8 having the potential to formulate “destructive tsunamis,” according to the USGS.  CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri reported at least 11 aftershocks have occurred, reaching magnitudes of between 3.9 and 6.1.  Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

"[VIDEO] 7.8 Magnitude Earthquake Hits Alaska, Tsunami Alert Issued",2020-07-22 09:02 UTC,https://www.techtimes.com/articles/251300/20200722/7-8-magnitude-earthquake-hits-alaska-tsunami-alert-issued.htm," The Alaskan peninsula has been recently struck by a 7.8-magnitude, confirmed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Alaska 7.8-Magnitude Earthquake According to reports, the tremor's ground zero was some 75 miles south of the city of Chignik at a depth of 10 kilometers or 6 miles beneath the surface, occurring this Wednesday morning, July 22. The USGS has also confirmed that two aftershocks between 3.9 and 5.7 magnitudes have been recorded in the area. The tremor has been felt as far away as Anchorage, which is around 500 miles away from the quake's epicenter. In a report by CNN, meteorologist Allison Chinchar has previously said that any tremor happening below 70 kilometers is a shallow quake, and it's important to know as these types of quakes often create the most damage than those that occurred deep in the earth, regardless of how strong they might be.  Prompting Tsunami Warning Following the massive tremor, the US National Tsunami Warning Center has issued a tsunami warning for coastal and southern Alaska as well as the nearby Aleutian Islands, with evacuations in the said places currently underway. People are trying to seek safety on higher grounds in the event of a tsunami. Nevertheless, the US National Weather has guaranteed no tsunami threats in Canada and the Western Coast of the US. Additionally, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has also confirmed that there are no tsunami threats in Hawaii, and no ""destructive Pacific-wide tsunami"" is expected following the massive Alaska earthquake. Meanwhile, some people who are affected have shared their experience on Twitter. Among them is Kelsey Frazier, who shared a short video of the tsunami sirens blaring and sharing that cars have been ""streaming up Skyline, one after another.""  She soon tweeted that reports said they are unlikely to see any big waves, but centers are still on alert to ensure they could issue a proper warning before any other calamity strikes.

         LONE PINE (CBS SF) -- More than a dozen aftershocks to continued to ramble through the eastern Sierra near Mount Whitney Thursday, forcing rangers to delay searching for possible victims and assessing the damage done to several popular hiking trails by a 5.8 earthquake that rocked the region.  While it caused little damage to structures in the rural region, the quake did rock the Whitney Portal campground area. It has been followed by more than two dozen aftershocks over the last 24 hours ranging in magnitude from 4.6 to 2.5. The aftershocks delayed efforts to search for possible victims Thursday morning. Rangers said no one has been reported missing but the area is extremely popular with hikers. There were 40 vehicles in the parking area near the Whitney Portal campgrounds at the time of the quake. ""After an evaluation by a U.S. Forest Service geologist this morning, the intention is to send in search and rescue teams and canines to check each of the debris fields,"" according to a release by the Inyo County Sheriff's Department.  Search and rescue teams would focus on several areas of park. ""Aerial reconnaissance, as well as reports from hikers identified several additional slides,"" the sheriff department said. ""One directly above Lone Pine Lake, one about a quarter of a mile above Long Pine Lake near the main trail and there were three slides on Mt. Whitney...It is unclear if the Mt. Whitney Trail has been damaged."" Inyo County deputies did evacuate the popular Whitney Portal campground after the quake. Deputies also posted on social media that Horseshoe Meadows Road was closed due to rocks and debris. The Whitney Portal is the gateway to Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States and is the trailhead for the Mount Whitney Trail.  The quake was felt as far away as Bakersfield, Stockton and throughout the Central Valley. The area is located between Sequoia National Park and Death Valley National Park.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

"Powerful earthquake shakes southern Mexico, at least 5 dead",2020-06-24 08:39 UTC,https://www.news4jax.com/news/world/2020/06/23/powerful-earthquake-shake-southern-central-meico/,"Associated Press   Associated Press MEXICO CITY – A powerful earthquake centered near the southern Mexico resort of Huatulco killed at least five people, swayed buildings in Mexico City and sent thousands fleeing into the streets.  Oaxaca state Gov. Alejandro Murat said a 22-year-old woman and a man were among the dead. Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed and another injured in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise he said reports were of less severe damage from the magnitude 7.4 quake, including broken windows and collapsed walls. Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat later said a second person was killed in an apparent house collapse in the tiny mountain village of San Juan Ozolotepec. The state-run oil company known as Pemex said the quake caused a fire at its refinery in the Pacific coast city of Salina Cruz, relatively near the epicenter. It said too one worker fell from a refinery structure to his death. López Obrador said there had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out to some areas. Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Inside a Mexico City military barracks converted to COVID-19 hospital, medical staff suited in protective equipment tried to calm anxious patients. Unable to evacuate isolation areas, patients huddled under a large beam in the women's ward while a nurse tried to calm one having a panic attack. Teresa Juárez could only wish for it to pass quickly from her hospital bed where she lay connected to oxygen. Diabetic and with high blood pressure, Juárez said she thought about her five children. “It's horrible, you're here and you don't know what to do,” she said.  It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico. In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued. “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves three to 10 feet above tide levels along parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru and Ecuador. Guatemala's national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea. __ Associated Press writers Chris Torchia in Mexico City and Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.

 An earthquake struck near New Zealand's capital Monday morning, shaking many residents including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern who continued with a live TV interview at the parliament building. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake was 37 kms deep and the epicenter was 30 km northwest of Levin, a city in New Zealand's North Island close to the capital Wellington, according to Geonet. Geonet first classified the earthquake as magnitude 5.9. No damage was reported. It lasted for more than 30 seconds and caused panic in Wellington with several people in offices and homes getting under their tables for cover. The tremors started as Ardern was on TV from the parliament building, called the beehive. ""Quite a decent shake here ... if you see things moving behind me. The beehive moves a little more than most,"" she joked on the AM Show on Newshub. Ardern assured the host that she was safe, and the interview resumed. ""I'm not under any hanging lights and I look like I am in a structurally strong place,"" she added. When updated later on the earthquake she said it was ""not an unreasonable shake."" New Zealand lies on the seismically active ""Ring of Fire,"" a 40,000-km arc of volcanoes and ocean trenches girdling much of the Pacific Ocean. The city of Christchurch is still recovering from a 6.3 magnitude quake in 2011 that killed 185 people. In 2016, a 7.8 magnitude tremor hit the South Island town of Kaikoura, killing two and causing billions in damage, including in Wellington. The shaking was felt by about 37,000 people on Geonet's app. Emergency services in Wellington City said there were no immediate reports of damage. All trains in Wellington were suspended while engineers assessed the impact, the city's Metlink service said on Twitter.  "

The small magnitude earthquakes are “usually not felt, but can be recorded by seismograph.” Earthquakes are regular occurence in South Carolina, according to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.   At least five earthquakes reaching up to 2.4 magnitude rattled the Carolinas and Tennessee within 24 hours in March, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Those quakes ranged from 1.7 to 2.2 magnitude, according to the USGS.  A 2.4-magnitude earthquake hit Summerville, SC, in mid-March. “An earthquake of this magnitude is often felt or heard near the epicenter but rarely results in damage,"" Dorchester County spokesperson Tiffany Norton told WBTV News sister-station Live 5 News in Charleston.

Treasure Valley feels earthquake,2020-04-01 00:02 UTC,https://www.kivitv.com/news/treasure-valley-feels-earthquake,"Menu A large earthquake struck north of Boise, Idaho, Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking. The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 5 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, Idaho, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke’s Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn’t interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho’s coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases in the nation outside of New York City and surrounding counties.“It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said. The earthquake is added stress during an already stressful time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.” Brett Woolley, a restaurant owner in Stanley, said he heard earthquake coming before he felt it. “I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I’m sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.”    — ID Geological Survey (@IDGeoSurvey) March 31, 2020  That was an earthquake.

How do the effects of the coronavirus pandemic compare to that of a major earthquake?,2020-03-24 22:46 UTC,https://abc7.com/how-do-the-effects-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-compare-to-that-of-a-major-earthquake/6047020/,"WATCH LIVE Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones explains the similarities and differences of the coronavirus outbreak and a major earthquake and their effects on society. LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- California has been preparing for the ""big one,"" the 7.8 magnitude earthquake along the San Andreas Fault, for years. As society currently navigates life during different type of disaster, how do the effects on the community compare between a health pandemic and a major earthquake in Southern California? Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones explains. ""I think the long-term effect on our society might be similar,"" said Jones. ""We're having a big disruption to our economy and we're going to have quite a few people dead."" The Southern California Earthquake Center estimates that around 2,000 people in Southern California could die in a ""big one"" scenario. ""(The coronavirus outbreak) could easily kill way more people than most earthquakes would,"" said Jones. Another key difference is preparedness. ""What's going to be different in a big earthquake is that there is no notice, so you can't go panic-buying beforehand,"" she said. ""By the time you've got a big problem, the stores are not open and the supply chains are cut."" Jones said we should take note of the items that we would want in a disaster situation and keep them on hand at all times because an earthquake will come with no notice. ""I try to get food that has an at least one year shelf life. Peanut butter, tuna fish, canned fruit,"" said Jones. She said that, unlike after a major earthquake, we do not need to be concerned about water and power. One similarity between a health pandemic and a natural disaster is the economic effect. ""The economic pain coming through is going to be huge and we can't blame the victim because that's what fear makes us do,"" said Jones. The seismologist said the challenge is that we must find a way to come together in this time of need while, literally, staying apart. ""What's really at risk isn't our individual lives, but the health of our communities,"" she said. ""This is the time we need to be a community and find a way to do that when we aren't physically together.""

Zagreb Earthquake Strikes Croatian Capital Amid COVID-19 Lockdown,2020-03-23 21:05 UTC,https://www.inquisitr.com/5959288/zagreb-earthquake-coronavirus/,"Croatia was struck by a 5.3-magnitude earthquake just after 6 a.m. on Sunday, with the epicenter four miles north of its capital, Zagreb, according to The Guardian. Prime Minister Andrej Plenković stated that it was the largest earthquake Zagreb has faced in 140 years. In addition to rubble falling from buildings, slabs of concrete crushing cars below and chimneys crumbling from atop buildings, one of the city’s most iconic buildings was also damaged. The cathedral, which was rebuilt after an earthquake in 1880, lost one of its two spires during the earthquake.  More than 50 aftershocks continued to shake the capital through Monday, March 23, the largest of which was a 3.7-magnitude tremor at noon, according to the Associated Press. One 15-year-old girl died from the injuries she sustained during the seismic event and at least another 27 people were injured. Two hundred and fifty homes have been reported as damaged, and at least 59 people are being housed in temporary shelters. Mothers and newborn infants were evacuated and moved from the damaged maternity hospital to a new, safe location with the help of the Croatian army. More soldiers donned face masks and worked in the streets to remove rubble that fell from buildings, some of which date to the 19th century, as The Guardian reported. “Earthquakes are dangerous but coronavirus is even more so,” said Vili Beroš, the minister of health, according to The Guardian. The Guardian reported that there are a total of 235 current coronavirus cases in Croatia. Citizens were initially urged to leave their homes and to stay outside. Later, amid the dangers of the virus, Mayor Milan Bandic has urged people to return home, according to BBC. “Eighty percent of Zagreb residents live in structures that have reinforced concrete structures,” said Bandic. “We have two parallel crises that contradict each other,” said Prime Minister Andrej Plenković. “There are rules for when there is an earthquake, but when there is an earthquake at the same time when there is a global pandemic then it’s a much more complex situation,” Croatian Interior Minister Davor Božinović said. According to The Guardian, Croatians had been told to avoid public areas such as parks and squares where citizens often gather. Much of Zagreb’s public transportation systems have also been closed in response to the virus. As the citizens of Zagreb continue to adapt as the situation unfolds and circumstances change, they are still being told to use caution and to practice safe social distancing.

Croatia's Capital Recovers from Earthquake Amid COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-03-22 21:44 UTC,https://www.voanews.com/europe/croatias-capital-recovers-earthquake-amid-covid-19-pandemic,"

 Just as the Croatian government ordered citizens to stay at home and banned more than two people walking together as the country faces a surge of COVID-19 cases, a part of the country was rattled by a strong 5.5 earthquake, followed by a series of aftershocks, according to the local authorities.  Officials say the historic core of the capital Zagreb suffered heavy damages, but there was no immediate human loss. Physicians are fighting to save the life of a 15-year-old girl who was first believed to be dead when rescuers pulled her from a pile of rubble.   “When the first quake subsided, I started dressing, but was stopped by the second tremor. I dressed quickly, grabbed the bag with documents and other essentials kept ready for emergencies and ran out,” said retiree Branka Ružić who lives on a northern street of central Zagreb and was asked to stay at home during the coronavirus pandemic. “People gathered on a lawn outside the building, with masks over their faces, trying to sit as far as possible from one another,” she said. To make matters worse, the morning was exceptionally cold after a warm spell just a couple of days before. Ružić told VOA Sunday that she fears spending the night at home, especially because her building lost telephone and internet connection.  Many other households lost water, gas or electricity. “Our building manager cut off our gas supply for security reasons and so we don’t have heat or hot water. He cannot reconnect it before an official inspection determines it is safe,” said Sina Karli, a resident of a 1927 building in central Zagreb. She said houses built after the 1960s are made to better cope with earthquakes. Zagreb’s old city core was built before 1950 and contains protected historic buildings.  “Some of the most beautiful ones were heavily damaged,” journalist Željko Žutelija told VOA. The Zagreb Cathedral, which was destroyed in an 1880 earthquake, had one of its steeples damaged in the recent quake. The two initial quakes were followed by at least 100 aftershocks, causing panic and forcing people into the street just after authorities imposed strict quarantine rules and penalties for breaking them. Žutelija said the government, the health authorities and others responded promptly and efficiently.  “The civil protection services, firefighters, police and the military were all engaged to help the most vulnerable citizens,” he said. “Several babies were born in Zagreb’s chief maternal hospital during the earthquake with new mothers running outside almost directly after the delivery. Many babies were born in cars. Mothers and new babies in incubators were promptly moved to other hospitals.” Žutelija says this is the worst period in the city’s history that he can remember, worse even than the unrest surrounding the fall of former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.  Many people said they cannot worry about the virus when they are not sure if they are safe at home. “For days we have lived in fear of the virus and then we woke up to a destructive force of an earthquake,” said Maja Beck, who watched in horror as things rattled around her. “Initially, a new horror, annulled the other. But in the end, the virus turned out to be much more deadly and it is not over yet,” she added. Authorities have asked people to adhere to the latest recommendations and keep away from one another. “I live in an old building and went to stay with a friend who lives in a newer one. After a while we all took our masks off,” said author Marina Horkić. “When I returned, my neighbor who is an engineering inspector told me the building is solid and could survive another 100 years, but who knows. All of the building residents have left the city, except for me and a couple of renters,” said Horkić, wondering “should I spend the night at home or go back to my friend’s house?” "

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, although the quake was a surprise to many people in the area, as New York state doesn’t experience much seismic activity.   On the website Earthquake Report, numerous locals said they could feel or even hear the tremor. “No property damage. 5 to 10 second consistent rumble, light shaking. I wish I were more awake when it happened,” one person wrote from Hudson Falls. “I was already up, but it Was a loud rumble, and it shook my whole house. My windows rattled as well and it woke my husband up as it was happening. Doesn’t seem like any damage thankfully. But pretty scary,” said a local from Queensbury. “I thought a truck crashed outside my house. I was upstairs and building shook and windows rattled,” added a person from Saratoga Springs. Meanwhile, research has found that New York City, which is about 200 miles south of the earthquake, might be at risk due to its population and other factors, although earthquakes rarely hit the East Coast.  “Too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard, and not enough to the risk,” he added. “Earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when Henry Hudson sailed up the River. But earthquake risk is much, much higher today since the number of people, assets and their vulnerability are so much greater.” Share this with everyone!"

The earthquake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest far-eastern Cuban city.  Officials say the epicenter was reportedly a relatively shallow 6 miles beneath the surface. An earthquake of this scale is categorized as a major quake and can cause serious damage. However, there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. According to ABC Affilate WPLG in Miami, people reported buildings shaking as a result of the quake. They also said Miami City Commissioner Ken Russell stated ""eight buildings in the Brickell and downtown areas self-evacuated and the building department was on-site.""

Magnitude 7.7 earthquake hits between Cuba and Jamaica,2020-01-28 20:11 UTC,https://fox59.com/2020/01/28/magnitude-7-7-earthquake-hits-between-cuba-and-jamaica/,"Fox 59 Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.        HAVANA — A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday, shaking a vast area from Mexico to Florida and beyond, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or heavy damage.  The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. “It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,” she told The Associated Press. It was also felt a little further east at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the southeastern coast of the island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages, said J. Overton, a spokesman for the installation, which has a total population of about 6,000 people. Several South Florida buildings were being evacuated as a precation, according to city of Miami and Miami-Dade County officials. No injuries or road closures have been reported. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands see so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. “‘It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,”‘ Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.” Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she had seen manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage. Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway. “It felt to me like i was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,” he said. He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize. The USGS initially reported the magnitude at 7.3.   This is a developing story and will be updated once more information is available.

Miami Buildings Shake After Powerful Earthquake Between Cuba and Jamaica,2020-01-28 14:40 UTC,https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/powerful-earthquake-reported-between-cuba-and-jamaica-usgs/2270286/,"Buildings in Miami were evacuated after vibrations from a powerful earthquake that struck between Cuba and Jamaica Tuesday afternoon were felt throughout South Florida. The 7.7 magnitude earthquake was reported about 77 miles north-northwest of Lucea, Jamaica, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Miami-Dade Police reported receiving phone calls of buildings shaking, and chopper footage showed multiple buildings being evacuated, including the Government Center on Northwest 1st Street. Miami-Dade Fire Rescue responded to reports of tremors felt at high-rise structures on S. Dadeland Boulevard, officials said. City of Miami Police said there were reports of vibrations in Downtown and Brickell, where some buildings were voluntarily evacuated, though there was no evacuation order. There were no injuries or damages reported, police said.  ""I can't remember in my lifetime there ever being a report of an earthquake being felt in the City of Miami,"" Mayor Francis Suarez said. Jorge Gomez said he and co-workers were on the 47th floor of the Wells Fargo building Downtown when he started feeling the building swaying. ""We were sitting down, we saw the blinds shaking, we felt sick to our stomachs. When I leaned up against the window, I felt my body moving or the window moving,"" Gomez said. ""We were saying 'the building's shaking, the building's shaking.'""  Miami inspectors were responding to buildings in Downtown to check for structural damages, officials said. Dr. Enrique Arango Arias, head of Cuba's National Seismological Service, told state media that there had been no serious damage or injuries reported. Gov. Carlos Joaquín González of Mexico’s Quintana Roo, which is home to Cancun, Tulum and other popular beach resorts, said the earthquake was felt in multiple parts of the low-lying Caribbean state but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize, but issued a later message saying the danger had passed. The quake was felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Roman Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city.

Powerful 7.7-Magnitude Caribbean Earthquake Triggers Evacuations From Miami To Jamaica,2020-01-28 05:00 UTC,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2020/01/28/powerful-77-magnitude-caribbean-earthquake-triggers-evacuations-from-miami-to-jamaica/," An intense tremor in between Cuba and Jamaica triggered a brief tsunami alert and sent people into the streets around the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday.  The tremors were felt as far away as the Bahamas and Florida, where some office buildings in the Miami area were evacuated. A USGS map of the quake epicenter region and where it was felt. A tsunami alert was issued for Jamaica and other countries within an bordering the Gulf of Mexico, but quickly expired without any major incident. So far some minor damage has been reported in the Cayman Islands, according to Reuters, but there has been no word of any serious injuries. Footage has begun to emerge of water sloshing around backyard pools, sinkholes and cracks in the earth. Some particularly wild footage shared on social media purported to show water sloshing around and spilling from two large water tanks. While the quake may have been recorded as centered in the Caribbean Sea between the island nations, it resulted from strike-slip faulting, which actually occurs over a larger fault area made up of hundreds of square miles. Despite the lack of major impacts so far, it appears to be the strongest earthquake the region has felt in many years. Dr. Grenville Draper of Florida International University told WPTV that its’s the biggest he’s seen in at least four decades. ""7.7 is pretty high, you want to compare it to the classic 1906 earthquake in San Francisco that was an 8.0, maybe a little more. So this is a pretty significant earthquake."" This latest earthquake comes after a series of slightly less powerful temblors rocked Puerto Rico, causing widespread damage, just a few weeks ago. Developing story.... "
"Death toll stands at 22 from Turkey earthquake; 1,100 hurt",2020-01-25 16:06 UTC,https://www.8newsnow.com/news/international/death-toll-stands-at-22-from-turkey-earthquake-1100-hurt/,"KLAS Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The death toll from a strong earthquake that rocked eastern Turkey climbed to 22 on Saturday as rescue crews searched for people who remained trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, officials said. Speaking at a televised news conference near the epicenter of the quake in Elazig province, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said 18 people were killed in Elazig and four in neighboring Malatya. Some 1,103 people were injured, with 34 of them in intensive care but not in critical condition, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the funeral of a mother and son killed in the quake while visiting the hardest-hit areas. He warned people against repeating “negative” hearsay about the country being unprepared for earthquakes. “Do not listen to rumors, do not listen to anyone’s negative, contrary propaganda, and know that we are your servants,” Erdogan said.  It was followed by 398 aftershocks, the strongest of them with magnitudes 5.4 and 5.1, the disaster agency said. Emergency workers and security forces distributed tents, beds and blankets as overnight temperatures dropped below freezing in the affected areas. Mosques, schools, sports halls and student dormitories were opened for hundreds who left their homes after the quake. “The earthquake was very severe. We desperately ran out (of our home),” Emre Gocer told the state-run Anadolu news agency as he sheltered with his family at a sports hall in Sivrice. “We don’t have a safe place to stay right now.” Erdogan on Saturday afternoon visited Sirvice and the city of Elazig, the provincial capital located some 565 kilometers (350 miles) east of Ankara. The Turkish leader promised state support for those affected by the disaster. “We will not leave anyone in the open,” he said. Earlier, a prosecutor in the capital Ankara announced an investigation into “provocative” social media posts. The Anadolu news agency reported that Turkey’s broadcasting authority was also reviewing media coverage of the quake. At least five buildings in Sivrice and 25 in Malatya province were destroyed in the disaster, Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said. Hundreds of other structures were damaged and made unsafe. AFAD reported that 42 people had been rescued as search teams combed wrecked apartment buildings. Television footage showed emergency workers removing a woman from the wreckage of a collapsed building 19 hours after the main earthquake struck. A prison in Adiyaman, 110 kilometers (70 miles) southwest of the epicenter, was evacuated due to damage its more than 800 prisoners transferred to nearby jails. AFAD said 28 rescue teams had been working around the clock. More than 2,600 personnel from 39 of Turkey’s 81 provinces were sent to the disaster site. Unmanned drones were used to survey damaged neighborhoods and coordinate rescue efforts. “Our biggest hope is that the death toll does not rise,” Parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop said. Communication companies announced free telephone and internet services for residents in the quake-hit region. Neighboring Greece, which is at odds with Turkey over maritime boundaries and gas exploration rights, offered to send rescue crews to assist the Turkish teams. Erdogan appeared to reject the offer of outside assistance during his visit to the city of Elazig, telling reporters, “Our state does not need anything.” Turkey sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent. Two strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey in 1999, killing around 18,000 people. A magnitude 6 earthquake killed 51 people in Elazig in 2010. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

"Earthquake activity will likely decrease in Puerto Rico, but chance remains for another strong quake",2020-01-15 13:47 UTC,https://www.wmar2news.com/news/national/earthquake-activity-will-likely-decrease-in-puerto-rico-but-chance-remains-for-another-strong-quake,"Menu  On Monday, scientists at the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) 
released the latest earthquake forecast for Puerto Rico.

    

   While the most likely scenario shows decreased activity, there is still a chance of another major earthquake striking in the next seven days. “According to our forecast, over the [next week,] there is a 4 percent chance of one or more aftershocks that are larger than magnitude 6.4,” the USGS said. “It is likely that there will be smaller earthquakes over the [next week,] with 40 to 230 magnitude-3 or higher aftershocks. Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily.” The uncertainty in the ground below their feet has thousands of Puerto Ricans sleeping outside. “We don’t know if there is going to be any other quake big enough to do additional damage or bigger than what we’ve seen so far,” said Jochen Braunmiller, a seismologist and research faculty member at the University of South Florida. “I was a little surprised about the actual location of those earthquakes because they are not happening right at the plate boundary between the North American and the Caribbean plate,” Braunmiller said. “They are happening close to the island and above the plate boundary.” Braunmiller said the quakes are hitting in a deformed zone near the upper crust. If the location of the earthquake changes, it could be catastrophic for the island. “The worst-case scenario for Puerto Rico would be a subduction zone earthquake on the order of magnitude 7.5 or 8,” Braunmiller said. “I don’t think from historical data earthquakes have been much bigger than that. It would take out a lot of infrastructure for Puerto Rico for quite a while.” The USGS is continually updating their forecast

 Braunmiller understands why people in Puerto Rico are terrified. No one can predict what happens next. “It’s a dangerous place,” Braunmiller said. “Each time you go up one magnitude level, you actually are releasing 30 times more energy.

Another earthquake hits Puerto Rico with 5.9 magnitude,2020-01-11 18:03 UTC,https://myfox8.com/2020/01/11/another-earthquake-hits-puerto-rico-with-5-9-magnitude/,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       An earthquake with a 5.9 magnitude rattled Puerto Rico on Saturday morning, the US Geological Survey reports. The quake was about 8 miles south of Indios, Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean Sea, the USGS said, at a depth of 6.2 miles. The USGS first said the preliminary magnitude was 6.0. Puerto Rico has been rattled by temblors throughout the week, including a 6.4 magnitude quake Tuesday that killed at least one man, destroyed homes and left most of the island without power. A 5.2 magnitude aftershock struck on Friday afternoon. The US territory was expecting power to return by Saturday to its 3 million residents, and authorities had tweeted that it was 95% restored a couple of hours before Saturday’s quake about 8 a.m. Parts of Lares, Adjuntas, Ponce and San German lost electrical service after Saturday’s quake, the power company Electric Energy Authority said. After the tremor, power was on to about 93% of the island, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority said. Since Dec. 28, about 500 earthquakes of magnitude 2.0 or higher have hit Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017. That storm killed almost 3,000 people, and left millions of Americans without power, water or shelter. Recovery has been slow and hard. Amid the earthquakes, Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced this week declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard. She told people to stay calm and expect aftershocks. Many took mattresses, tents and tarps into their yards to sleep, afraid of what aftershocks could do to their homes, already stressed or damaged. More than 6,000 people were staying in shelters, Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, the territory’s non-voting delegate to Congress, said Friday. Airbnb’s Open Homes program is offering free, temporary housing in Puerto Rico, its site says. “Relief workers, neighbors who’ve had to evacuate, and others impacted by the event” are eligible to book rooms at no cost, Airbnb says. “If you’ve been displaced or are helping with relief efforts, you can book free accommodations between January 9, 2020 and January 31, 2020.” Residents can also donate space for those in need of temporary housing.

5.4 Magnitude Aftershock Rocks Puerto Rico Days After Earthquake,2020-01-11 00:33 UTC,https://miami.cbslocal.com/2020/01/10/5-4-aftershock-puerto-rico-earthquake/,"Watch CBS News 
January 10, 2020 / 7:33 PM
          / CBS Miami
         (CNN) -- A 5.4 magnitude aftershock hit Puerto Rico's southern coast on Friday afternoon, days after an earthquake shook the island and left much of it without power. A CNN crew said its truck moved during the aftershock, one of the strongest since Tuesday's 6.4 magnitude quake. The aftershock came as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, is making aid available and assisting with damage assessment after the quake rocked the island before dawn on Tuesday. It was one of about 500 earthquakes of magnitude 2 or greater that have rattled the area since December 28, according to the US Geological Survey. The earthquake left one man dead, caused dozens of homes and other structures to crumble and left about two-thirds of residents in the dark. The US territory, still recovering from the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, expects to return power to all of its 3 million residents by Saturday, according to utility officials. Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with residents to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks. For many, that has meant bringing mattresses, tents and tarps into their yards to sleep, for fear of what aftershocks could do to their already damaged homes. Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico's non-voting delegate to Congress, spoke at a news conference Friday with Vázquez and Florida Sen. Rick Scott after touring the damaged Costa Sur Power Plant. She said more than 6,000 people were staying in shelters. Vázquez said she had spoken with President Donald Trump to thank him for his support and to urge his prompt approval of a major disaster declaration. Myrna Delgado said she sought refuge outside her home when the first temblors started on December 28. She slept in a van and then at a stadium shelter in the southwestern city of Yauco. ""I'm very nervous,"" she told CNN on Friday. ""At night I feel very depressed. We don't have light at home. With the company of other people, at least we feel safe."" Noelia de Jesus and her granddaughters are also among those in a shelter. They are also among the many who are looking for a place to stay for the third time, having lost their homes when Hurricane George struck in 1998 and again during Hurricane Maria. Luis Garcia, a resident of the southern coastal city of Guayanilla, said he was finding it harder to secure basics such as gas and food than after Hurricane Maria in 2017. The US Geological Survey (USGS) has modeled three forecasts of what may be in store for Puerto Rico over the next month. The most likely scenario, the USGS said, is that the aftershocks will continue to decrease in frequency; and though there may be medium and small quakes, there will not be another earthquake like Tuesday's in this sequence. USGS said the probability of this scenario is 84%. There a 14% chance of what is called a doublet, which is two large earthquakes of a similar size occurring in a similar location, the USGS said. Meaning there is a case in which the region could see another quake as powerful as 6.4 magnitude. Least likely is that Tuesday's earthquake could trigger an even larger one. While the probability is small, the impacts of that scenario would be devastating, the USGS said. ""The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,"" the agency said. As Puerto Rico waits to see what may follow, officials are aiming to restore power by the end of the weekend. Power has been restored to about 80 percent of Puerto Rico's 1.4 million utility customers across the island, Puerto Rico Electric Energy Authority said via Twitter on Friday, but the goal is for everyone to have power on Saturday. Three of the territory's major power plants are expected to be in service again by Saturday, with a fourth aimed at operating on Sunday, power utility CEO Jose Ortiz said. But the plant that supplies about a quarter of the island's power, Costa Sur Power Plant, suffered extensive damage and could be out of commission for a year, Ortiz said in an interview aired on ""CBS This Morning."" Officials are also working to reopen schools, which have canceled classes until crews can inspect buildings and ensure their safety for students. ""Classes in the public school system won't resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,"" Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won't return to the schools until further notice.    ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Puerto Rico hit with a magnitude-5.8 earthquake,2020-01-06 13:26 UTC,https://fox43.com/2020/01/06/puerto-rico-hit-with-a-magnitude-5-8-earthquake/,"An earthquake struck Puerto Rico early Monday, with plenty of aftershocks expected.  It was centered about 8 miles south-southeast of Indios, Puerto Rico, and struck at a depth of about 3.7 miles below ground. At least two houses collapsed in the southwestern coastal town of Guanica, Director of Emergency Management Carlos Acevedo told CNN affiliate WAPA-TV. Acevedo said one of the homes was abandoned. Some victims of the earthquake posted photos of deep cracks in walls. No tsunami warning was issued after the quake. But geologists warn of more tremors to come. “More earthquakes than usual (called aftershocks) will continue to occur near the mainshock,” the USGS said. “When there are more earthquakes, the chance of a large earthquake is greater which means that the chance of damage is greater.” The agency advised anyone in or near vulnerable structures to be extra cautious and said those caught in potential quakes should drop, cover and hold on.

Magnitude-5.8 earthquake strikes off the coast of Puerto Rico,2020-01-06 12:26 UTC,https://www.kgun9.com/news/national/magnitude-5-8-earthquake-strikes-off-the-coast-of-puerto-rico,"Menu  SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A 5.8-magnitude quake hit Puerto Rico before dawn Monday, unleashing small landslides, causing power outages and severely cracking some homes. It was one of the strongest quakes yet to hit the U.S. territory that has been shaking for the past week. There were no immediate reports of casualties.  Power outages were reported in some parts of Puerto Rico following the quake, Angel Vazquez, emergency management director for the southern coastal city of Ponce, told The Associated Press. “This is one of the strongest quakes to date since it started shaking on Dec. 28,” he said. “It lasted a long time.” Residents in southern coastal towns began posting pictures of partially collapsed homes and large boulders blocking roads as officials urged people to remain calm. Dr. Sindia Alvarado, who lives in the southern coastal town of Penuelas, said she was petrified. “My entire family woke up screaming,” she said. “I though the house was going to crack in half.” At a hotel in the southwest coastal town of Guanica, people panicked as they tried to flee in their cars, only to realize that large boulders were obstructing the only highway heading north to the capital of San Juan, attorney Jose Francisco Benitez told the AP. “There was a state of panic,” he said. “There were even people in their underwear walking around the hotel.” He said he and his girlfriend were in the room when the quake struck. “I have never felt anything like this,” he said. “It was like a giant grabbed our room and shook it.” The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico’s southern region began the night of Dec. 28, with quakes ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to 5.1. Previous quakes of lesser magnitudes in recent days have cracked homes and led to goods falling off supermarket shelves.  One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a 7.3-magnitude quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.

Magnitude-5.8 earthquake strikes off the coast of Puerto Rico,2020-01-06 12:26 UTC,https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/national/magnitude-5-8-earthquake-strikes-off-the-coast-of-puerto-rico,"Menu GUANICA, Puerto Rico (AP) — A 5.8 magnitude quake hit Puerto Rico before dawn Monday, unleashing small landslides, causing power outages and collapsing some homes, as well as a famed tourist attraction. It was one of the strongest quakes yet in a series that have hit the U.S. territory over the past week. There were no immediate reports of casualties.   The shake collapsed a coastal rock formation that had formed a sort of rounded window, Punta Ventana, that was a popular tourist draw in the southwest town of Guayanilla. In the southern town of Guanica, Mayor Santos Seda told The Associated Press that five homes collapsed, but only one of them was inhabited. No injuries had been reported. Another 29 homes were heavily damaged and about to collapse, he said. Helicopters buzzed overhead and terrified residents jumped up from their folding chairs every time the earth shook, yelling at others to stay away from power lines. Few people dared go back inside their homes, but José Quiñones, 54, had no choice. His 80-year-old mother had heart problems and was lying in bed. Dozens of people in a neighborhood called Hope in Guanica walked around with their phones and yelled out the magnitude of the latest earthquakes as they tried to calm children who were forced to open the presents they'd received for Three Kings Day, a religious holiday, on streets and sidewalks. “This is hell,” said Albert Rodríguez, 43, whose home collapsed on one side as the smell of gas filled the air. “We haven’t slept.... You can’t remain calm here. Guanica is no longer a safe place.” Less than a block away, Silvestre Alicea surveyed his home, which collapsed on his prized blue 1977 Toyota Corolla as he leaped from the balcony. Alicea had lived in New York for years until he retired to Guanica two years ago to live in the home he spent 15 years building. He doesn’t have insurance. People in the working-class neighborhood shared soda and snacks as they sought shelter from a harsh sun, careful to stay away from homes whose columns and foundations were heavily cracked. Many already had bags packed in their cars with a change of clothes, food, water and medicine. Some like Noelia De Jesús, 69, and her husband, who uses a wheelchair, didn’t know where they would spend the night. Government officials who inspected their home earlier in the morning said it was unsafe to live in and advised them to stay elsewhere. “Everything broke, including the TV,” she said. “This is horrible.” Puerto Rico doesn’t have a public earthquake warning system, except for sirens that are supposed to ring in case of a tsunami. Residents in this neighborhood criticized the government for what they believe is a lack of action. Dr. Sindia Alvarado, who lives in the southern coastal town of Penuelas, said she was petrified. “My entire family woke up screaming,” she said. “I though the house was going to crack in half.” The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico's southern region began the night of Dec. 28, with quakes ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to 5.1.

Earthquake Felt Across Southern New England,2020-11-08 22:39 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/earthquake-felt-across-southern-new-england_3570246.html,"BOSTON—The strongest earthquake to hit southern New England in decades rattled homes and nerves Sunday morning, but didn’t cause any significant damage, authorities said. The 3.6 magnitude earthquake centered off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts, in Buzzards Bay struck just after 9 a.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Earthquake Information Center. The earthquake hit at a depth of a little more than 9.3 miles and was felt across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and into Connecticut and Long Island, New York. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a magnitude 3.5 temblor hit in March 1976, said Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist. About 14,000 people went to the agency’s website to report the earthquake, including people from Easthampton, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut, both about 100 miles away, and several from more than 50 miles away in Boston, he said. That’s not unusual in New England. “It’s common for them to be felt very far away because the rock here is old and continuous and transmits the energy a long way,” Caruso said. Ali Kenner Brodsky, who lives in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, not far from the epicenter, was sitting in her kitchen talking with her son, when it hit. “It was a rumbling. It sounded like something exploded. It rumbled. The whole house shook,” she said. She said it lasted around 10 to 15 seconds. “In that moment, it feels like it’s going on forever.” Her husband, Sam, ran to the basement because he thought the boiler blew up. Magnitude 3.6 earthquakes rarely cause major damage, Caruso said. Chris Besse, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said it had not received any reports of significant damage. There were some reports of minor damage. Police in Fall River tweeted that they received numerous phone calls about the quake, including reports of items falling off of shelves, and street signs getting uprooted.

Little girl trapped under earthquake rubble for 65 hours rescued,2020-11-03 15:36 UTC,https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/world/little-girl-trapped-under-earthquake-rubble-for-65-hours-rescued,"Menu In the wake of a destructive earthquake off the coast of Turkey on Friday that left much of its third-largest city in rubble, some hope is shining through three days later. At least 83 people have died and more than 1,000 have been injured from the earthquake, which centered in the Aegean Sea near the Greek island of Samos. However, in a series of remarkable rescues, first responders in the city of Izmir are continuing to pull citizens from the rubble of collapsed buildings. On Monday, emergency crews extracted a 3-year-old girl who had been trapped for 65 hours after her apartment building collapsed. Authorities said the little girl had no serious injuries. Under a different building, a 14-year-old girl buried under debris for more than 58 hours was also rescued. Search-and-rescue teams worked tirelessly over the weekend to find those still missing amid the destruction. On Sunday, they saved a 70-year-old man who fell under his collapsed building. Dr. Fahrettin Koca, the country’s health minister, tweeted that this man, Ahmet Citim, told him he “never lost hope,” according to the Associated Press. Turkey is a transcontinental country that sits between geographic fault lines, making the country especially prone to earthquakes, according to the AP. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the earthquake as 7.0 on Friday. At least 70 people were rescued in Izmir after a few dozen buildings collapsed at the time of the earthquake, according to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD). NATO, whose land forces are stationed in Izmir, and the U.S. Air Force reported that their personnel were safe and accounted for after the initial shock in the city.

Three-year-old girl rescued alive after 65 hours trapped under rubble in Turkey earthquake,2020-11-02 07:56 UTC,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/02/europe/turkey-earthquake-girl-rescue-intl-hnk/index.html,"
      A 3-year-old girl has been rescued alive from a collapsed apartment building in Izmir, Turkey, following Friday’s strong earthquake, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu.
   
      The child, identified by authorities as Elif Perincek, was rescued on Monday morning, more than 65 hours after the devastating quake struck. 
   
      Emergency workers who had worked tirelessly to rescue her applauded as Elif – wrapped in a foil blanket and covered in dust – was carried through the wreckage and into an ambulance.
   
      Muammer Celik, the firefighter who pulled the girl from the rubble of her home, told CNN that she held tight to his hand until he brought her to safety.
   
      “I thought she might be in the space between her bed and her dresser. I went in that direction and that’s where I found her lying on her back. I picked her up. I cleaned her face got rid of the dust. She held my finger and wouldn’t let go until we got to ambulance,” Celik said.
   
      “Elif is our miracle,” he added.
   
      Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said Perincek’s mother and two others were rescued earlier, but, unfortunately, one of her siblings had died. 
   
      Koca said later on Monday that the 3-year-old had been taken to hospital and was being treated in intensive care. He said she had not sustained any serious fractures or muscle crush injuries and was in good condition.
   
      News of the rescue came just hours after another child was found alive under the rubble and safely brought to the surface by rescue teams. Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said that 14-year-old Idil Sirin was rescued after she had spent more than 58 hours trapped under a collapsed building. 
   
      In phone video showing the dramatic moment of Sirin’s rescue, dozens of onlookers are heard cheering excitedly as she is freed from the wreckage. She was given first aid at the scene before being transported to a local hospital, according to Anadolu.
   
      At least 91 people died and 994 were injured after the earthquake – measured as magnitude-7.0 by the US Geological Survey – struck in the Aegean Sea on Friday, shaking parts of Greece and Turkey. 
   
      The quake struck 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) northeast of the town of Néon Karlovásion on Samos, the USGS reported, at a relatively shallow depth of 21 kilometers (13 miles), making its impact powerfully felt at ground level around the epicenter.
   
      Some 20 buildings were seriously damaged in Izmir by the tremor, according to Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer, the majority of them in the middle-class Bayrakli district.
   
      More than 900 aftershocks have been registered since the initial quake, 42 of them with a magnitude over 4.0, Turkey’s disaster agency said. The earthquake also triggered what authorities called a “mini tsunami,” causing streets to flood Friday in parts of Turkey’s wider Izmir province, as well as on Samos.

"Strong Earthquake Strikes Turkish Coast and Greek Island, Killing 27",2020-10-31 10:18 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/strong-earthquake-strikes-turkish-coast-and-greek-island-killing-27_3559749.html,"IZMIR, Turkey—Three young children and their mother were rescued alive from the rubble of a collapsed building in western Turkey on Saturday, some 23 hours after a powerful earthquake in the Aegean Sea killed at least 30 people and injured more than 800 others. The Friday afternoon quake that struck Turkey’s Aegean coast and north of the Greek island of Samos registered a magnitude that Turkish authorities put at 6.6 while other seismology institutes said it measured 6.9. It toppled buildings in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, and triggered a small tsunami in the Seferihisar district and on the Greek island. Hundreds of aftershocks followed. At least 28 people were killed in Izmir, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca wrote on Twitter. Among them was an elderly woman who drowned in the tsunami. But rescue teams on Saturday made contact with 38-year old Seher Perincek and her four children—ages 3, 7 and 10-year-old twins—inside a fallen building in Izmir and cleared a corridor to bring them out. One by one, the mother and three of her children were removed from the rubble as rescuers applauded or hugged. Efforts were still underway to rescue the remaining child, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The survivors, including 10-year-old Elzem Perincek, were moved into ambulances on stretchers. The girl was speaking and said one of her feet hurt. “I’m fine; I was rescued because only one of my feet was pinned. That foot really hurt,” she said. Earlier Saturday, search-and-rescue teams working on eight collapsed buildings lifted teenager Inci Okan out of the rubble of a devastated eight-floor apartment block. Her dog, Fistik, or Pistachio, was also rescued, Turkish media reported. A video showed a female rescuer trying to calm down the 16-year-old girl under the rubble as she inserted a catheter. “I’m so scared,” the girl cried. “Can you hold my hand?” “We are going to get out of here soon,” the rescuer, Edanur Dogan, said. “Your mother is waiting outside for you.” Friends and relatives waited outside the building for news of loved ones still trapped inside, including employees of a dental clinic that was located on the ground floor. Two other women, aged 53 and 35, were brought out from the rubble of another toppled two-story building earlier on Saturday. In all, around 100 people have been rescued since the earthquake, Murat Kurum, the environment and urban planning minister, told reporters. It was unclear how many more people were trapped under buildings that were leveled. Some 5,000 rescue personnel were working on the ground, Kurum said. Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD, said 885 people were injured in Izmir and three other provinces. The health minister said seven people were being treated in intensive care, with three of them in critical condition. Two teenagers were killed on Samos after being struck by a collapsing wall. At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. The earthquake, which the Istanbul-based Kandilli Institute said had a magnitude of 6.9, was centered in the Aegean northeast of Samos. AFAD said it measured 6.6. and hit at a depth of some 16 kilometers (10 miles). It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as Athens and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece as well. Authorities warned residents in Izmir not to return to damaged buildings, saying they could collapse in strong aftershocks. Many people spent the night out in the streets, too frightened to return to their homes, even if they sustained no damage. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity, and the leaders of Greece and Turkey held a telephone conversation. “I thank President Erdogan for his positive response to my call,” the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Saturday before traveling to Samos, where he visited the families of the teenagers who were killed. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and nominal NATO allies. By Mehmet Guzel and Suzan Fraser Share this with everyone!"

         The death toll is climbing by the hour after a powerful earthquake struck the Aegean Sea off the coast of Turkey and the Greek island of Samos. At least 19 people are dead and hundreds are injured after the magnitude 7.0 earthquake hit early Friday, rattling cities and unleashing a tsunami that flooded streets in western Turkey.  Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency said 17 people died and 709 people were injured, Reuters reported. Two teenagers, a boy and a girl, died on Samos. It's not yet clear how many people have been crushed in their own homes in Turkey, a country that's infamous for poor quality construction. Rescue workers are searching through the rubble for survivors and bodies.  Duygu Kati, a high school principal, told CBS News she safely evacuated all her students. She said the building almost collapsed.  Because it's positioned on a number of major fault lines, Turkey is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries, according to Reuters. More than 17,000 people have died as a result of earthquakes in the nation in recent decades.  Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told a state broadcaster that there's a heightened risk of aftershocks powerful enough to topple buildings because the earthquake's epicenter had a shallow depth, The Associated Press reported.  Turkey and Greece are currently fighting over exploration rights in the Mediterranean, Reuters reported — but both leaders tweeted about the need for solidarity during times of crisis.  ""Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,"" wrote Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. ""That two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,"" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said.    Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

(AP Photo/Emrah Gurel) ISTANBUL – A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 19 people and injuring over 700 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 17 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, including one who drowned, and 709 were injured, according to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD.  Among the dead were the wife and two children of the secretary-general of the Turkish Medical Association’s Izmir branch, the group said. On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying “Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children.” At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said.  The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall and cranes lifted concrete slabs from the wreckage.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul’s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey’s largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter — roughly 10 kilometers — potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 3,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens.  France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France’s “full solidarity with Greece and Turkey” and said “we are ready to offer the necessary aid.”  The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. Some islanders planned to spend the night in emergency tents for fear of aftershocks. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. “We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,"" Turkey’s Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. ""This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We’re ready to help if Greece needs it.”  Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, tweeted that he had phoned Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together.” Erdogan responded to the tweet with his thanks and offered his condolences. “Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds.

USGS Reports Preliminary 3.1 Magnitude Earthquake in New Jersey,2020-09-09 02:25 UTC,https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/usgs-reports-preliminary-3-1-magnitude-earthquake-in-new-jersey/2607680/,"The United States Geological Survey says a small earthquake was detected in New Jersey early Wednesday morning. A magnitude 3.1 earthquake's epicenter was near southeast of East Freehold, New Jersey, according to USGS. Public reports suggested the quake was felt as far away as Philadelphia and Long Island. ""I live in Freehold and I thought something hit the house,"" Theresa McAllister said. Most in the area who felt the tremor were not aware what it actually was until later. ""It woke me up like a freight train coming down the tracks, it sounded like a sonic boom,"" said Mike Page.   ""It will take a few days or weeks before analysts can see if there’s a specific fault line at cause here,"" Sanders said. He added that structural damage is possible but unlikely. Damages are more likely to be things falling off shelves. In the general New York area, it's slightly more common. Seismologists said that an earthquake similar in size can be expected about once a year in the region. ""There is a consistent pattern in the eastern United States that the earthquakes are responding to a squeezing force in the northeast to southwest direction,"" said John Armbruster of the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory. ""There isn't one big fault line, the rocks around the New York City area are hundreds of millions of years old, they've had a rough life.""  A spokesperson for the Monmouth County Sherrif's Office tells News 4 that there were at least 125 calls in a half-hour span into the 911 call center; no damage was reported. The office also released video from an outside camera that shook for less than a second. The USGS says more than 5,500 people have submitted ""Felt It"" reports online.  The Freehold Police Department said dispatch fielded dozens of calls and that the epicenter of the earthquake was 500 feet away from the police station. A spokesperson for the department said the quake felt more like “the floor dropped out” rather than a wavy motion. Unlike earthquakes on the West Coast, the ones that occur on the West Coast are more widely felt, according to USGS. Scientists are researching the reasons but some of the factors have to do with the nature of tectonic plates and the size and age of buildings here. New Jersey's own Department of Environmental Protection says the state is probably overdue for a more significant earthquake, like the magnitude 5.5 temblor that struck in 1884 that caused damage on Staten Island. Such a quake, were it to strike today, would result in ""severe damage"" and would ""likely"" cause fatalities, the state says.  ""Earthquakes are very infrequent, but if a large one happens it would be much more devastating in the East than something out West,"" said Thomas Pratt, of the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program. ""The reason is everything out West is built to withstand earthquakes. Most buildings in the East are not."""

"Rare ""boomerang"" earthquake detected under the Atlantic Ocean for the first time",2020-08-12 03:53 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/11/rare-boomerang-earthquake-detected-under-atlantic-ocean-first-time/,"(CBS News) - For years, scientists have been attempting to track an extremely rare “boomerang” earthquake. Now, they’ve recorded one in the ocean for the first time - and it’s even more bizarre than they expected.  Earthquakes are the result of rocks breaking on a fault, which is a boundary between two plates. A ""boomerang"" earthquake, also known as a ""back-propagating supershear rupture,"" means the fracture travels away from the initial crack before returning to it at even faster speeds, scientists said.  Large earthquakes are capable of destroying buildings and triggering tsunamis, so understanding how they work is imperative to assessing potential hazards and implementing warning systems for future quakes.  According to a new study in the journal Nature Geoscience, a team, led by scientists from the University of Southampton and Imperial College London, successfully recorded a magnitude 7.1 earthquake on August 29, 2016. It ran along the Romanche fracture zone, a 560-mile-long fault line under the Atlantic Ocean near the equator, between Brazil and Africa.   Scientists say that large — meaning magnitude 7 or higher — quakes are difficult to study because they often set off a series of chain reactions along intricate networks of faults. Faults under the ocean have simple shapes, but they are located far away from seismometer networks on land, so an underwater network of seismometers is needed.  Researchers said the quake traveled in one direction between the South American and African tectonic plates, then boomeranged back to the start at ultra-fast speeds — breaking the “seismic sound barrier” — a sonic boom of sorts.  An analysis revealed the quake had two distinct phases. The rupture traveled upward and eastward first, before suddenly reversing and heading back west to the center of the fault at an accelerated speed of 3.7 miles per second.  Scientists aren’t exactly sure how this occurred, but they believe the first phase somehow triggered its more aggressive counterpart.  Only a handful of boomerang earthquakes have ever been recorded — the phenomenon has mostly been theoretical, until now.  ""Whilst scientists have found that such a reversing rupture mechanism is possible from theoretical models, our new study provides some of the clearest evidence for this enigmatic mechanism occurring in a real fault,"" lead author Dr. Stephen Hicks, from the Department of Earth Sciences and Engineering at Imperial College London, said in a press release.  ""Even though the fault structure seems simple, the way the earthquake grew was not, and this was completely opposite to how we expected the earthquake to look before we started to analyze the data."" Scientists said that if a similar type of quake occurred on land, it would drastically affect the amount of ground shaking — and possibly widen the affected area. Successfully tracking more boomerang quakes would allow researchers to better predict and assess the hazards from such events, improving impact forecasts.  Copyright 2020 CBS Interactive Inc.

         SACRAMENTO (CBS / AP) — California's earthquake early warnings will be a standard feature on all Android phones, bypassing the need for users to download the state's MyShake app in order to receive alerts, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services said. The state worked with the U.S. Geological Survey and Google, the maker of Android, to build the quake alerts into all phones that run the commonplace operating system. The deal was expected to be announced Tuesday. ""This announcement means that California's world-class earthquake early warning system will be a standard function on every Android phone — giving millions precious seconds to drop, cover and hold on when the big one hits,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. The technology does not predict earthquakes. It is designed to quickly take data from seismic sensors and send warnings to potentially affected areas if a quake of magnitude 4.5 or greater occurs and if the projected shaking at a particular location is at a certain level of intensity. The MyShake technology was developed by the University of California, Berkeley, and released in 2019. Last December, the system sent out its first early warning to users, notifying them about a magnitude 4.3 earthquake in Central California. Warnings produced by the ShakeAlert system are also pushed through the wireless notification system that issues Amber Alerts, meaning some people receive both notifications. © Copyright 2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

In Sparta, North Carolina, it left a significant amount of damage downtown, with bricks falling off several buildings. “We had gotten woken up by a boom a little after two and couldn’t go back to sleep,” said Jacob Church, a Sparta resident. “At first it was like, ‘What’s going on?’ None of us were injured. I think it’s a cool thing to be a part of that,” said Brandon Lineberry, who was visiting at the time. The quake rattled a cemetery so hard, it uprooted headstones from the ground. Just a few miles from downtown, the North Carolina Department of Transportation was dealing with the damage to a water main. “We’re just trying to get it back open. It’s buckled up the road a little from the water main, from the earthquake, and we’re just trying to get it back to normal,” said Jeffery Jones, with the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The damage was significant at Scott’s Landscaping Nursery and Farms, leaving several cracks in the parking lot and shattering pottery. “It’s been a rough morning. You don’t expect anything like this to happen here because it doesn’t happen here,” said owner Scott Smith, adding that “2020 has been a rough year for a lot of people.” The mayor of Sparta, Wes Brinegar, issued a state of emergency Sunday after the earthquake hit. No injuries had been reported.  The mayor said Sunday there was widespread minor damage to homes, with structures and chimneys being knocked off.   Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

Please enter a search term.       RIDGECREST, Calif. – A magnitude 5.8 earthquake has struck a remote area of central California.   Veteran seismologist Lucy Jones says the quake occurred in the same location as a magnitude-4.6 quake that hit on Monday night. Jones says the earlier tremor is now considered a foreshock. In his Wednesday remarks on COVID-19, Gov. Gavin Newsom made mention of the quake in that “Mother Nature made sure we were reminded of her fury.” “Almost a year ago in two weeks, we had a major earthquake in the state of California — Ridgecrest,” Newsom said. “Just about 20 minutes ago, we experienced another trembler — just 5.8 on the Richter scale — but enough to remind all of us of our responsibilities as Californians, our vulnerabilities as Californians as it relates to the issue of earthquakes.”

"Powerful earthquake shakes southern, central Mexico",2020-06-23 17:30 UTC,https://www.wsls.com/news/world/2020/06/23/powerful-earthquake-shake-southern-central-meico/,"See the complete list WEATHER ALERT Associated Press   Associated Press MEXICO CITY – A powerful earthquake centered near the southern Mexico resort of Huatulco killed at least two people, swayed buildings in Mexico City and sent thousands fleeing into the streets.  Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed and another injured in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise he said reports were of minor damage from the magnitude 7.4 quake, including broken windows and collapsed walls. Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat later said a second person was killed in an apparent house collapse in the tiny mountain village of San Juan Ozolotepec. The state-run oil company known as Pemex said the quake caused a fire at its refinery in the Pacific coast city of Salina Cruz, relatively near the epicenter. It said one worker was injured and the flames were quickly extinguished. López Obrador said there had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out to some areas. Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Inside a Mexico City military barracks converted to COVID-19 hospital, medical staff suited in protective equipment tried to calm anxious patients. Unable to evacuate isolation areas, patients huddled under a large beam in the women's ward while a nurse tried to calm one having a panic attack. Teresa Juárez could only wish for it to pass quickly from her hospital bed where she lay connected to oxygen. Diabetic and with high blood pressure, Juárez said she thought about her five children. “It's horrible, you're here and you don't know what to do,” she said.  It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico. In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued.  “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking.  The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves three to 10 feet above tide levels along parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru and Ecuador. Guatemala's national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea. __ Associated Press writers Chris Torchia in Mexico City and Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.

Ardern was speaking with Newshub host Ryan Bridge about the country’s coronavirus restrictions as a magnitude 5.6 earthquake hit just before 8 a.m., visibly shaking the camera. There were no reports of major injuries or damage, according to ABC News and CNN. “We’re just having a bit of an earthquake here, Ryan, quite a decent shake here,” Ardern said from the parliament complex, while looking around. “But, if you see things moving behind me…”  — ABC News (@ABC) May 25, 2020 After confirming the earthquake had stopped, Bridge asked the prime minister if she felt “safe and well” to keep going with the interview.  “We’re fine, Ryan,” she responded. “I’m not under any hanging lights. I look like I’m in a structurally sound place.” The earthquake, which was strong enough to halt train services, was reportedly felt by thousands in New Zealand.  Ardern has been praised for her handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The country has documented 1,504 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and only 21 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

"Magnitude 5.5 Earthquake Hits Near Puerto Rico, Damage Reported",2020-05-02 13:43 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/earthquake-hits-near-puerto-rico-damage-reported_3335781.html,"SAN JUAN—A 5.4-magnitude earthquake hit near southern Puerto Rico on Saturday, briefly knocking out power and jolting many from their beds on an island where some people still remain in shelters from previous quakes earlier this year. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit at a shallow depth of 5.6 miles (nine kilometers) near the city of Ponce and the towns of Guanica and Guayanilla, where hundreds of homes were destroyed by a quake in early January that killed one person and caused millions of dollars in damage.  — USGS Big Quakes (@USGSBigQuakes) May 2, 2020  
Reports of damage were still trickling in on Saturday, with at least one second-story balcony crashing in the southern city of Ponce, spokeswoman Inés Rivera told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, cracks in homes were reported in Guayanilla.
“Everything shook really hard,” spokesman Danny Hernández said by phone.
Meanwhile, in Guánica, Mayor Santos Seda told the AP that no major damage has been reported so far, but noted that between five to 10 people remain in a shelter since the 6.4-magnitude quake that hit in January.
“Thank God everyone is OK,” he said. “The infrastructure is already weak.”
Several aftershocks hit Puerto Rico’s southern region, including a 4.9-magnitude one.
Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, said in a phone interview that while it’s understandable many people are afraid and surprised by the most recent earthquake, it’s not unusual given the seismic activity that began in the region in late December.

“In the long run, it’s decreasing, but you can have peaks,” he said, adding that he expects strong aftershocks to continue.
The earthquake struck as Puerto Ricans are ordered to remain home as part of a two-month lockdown to help curb the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus cases. Gov. Wanda Vázquez tweeted that rescue crews were fanning out across the area and that she would shortly be traveling there to meet with those affected in person.
“If your infrastructure is damaged, you must leave with your face mask on and your emergency backpack,” she said as she urged people to remain calm.
But nerves are already frayed in many parts of the island as Puerto Rico continues to recover from Hurricane Maria, a string of strong earthquakes and the CCP virus. Silvestre Alicea, a 67-year-old man who moved back to Puerto Rico from New York upon retiring, lost his home in January’s earthquake and is still living with his sister in Guanica.
“This is unreal,” he said, adding that some neighbors have left the area to stay with relatives elsewhere and that many, including a security guard who worked all night, are now sitting nervously in their balconies. “He hasn’t slept.”
Alicea, however, said he decided to knock down a couple of breadfruits from a nearby tree as the aftershocks continue: “I’m taking it easy. There’s nothing else you can do.”

The 7.7 magnitude earthquake was reported about 77 miles north-northwest of Lucea, Jamaica, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Miami-Dade Police reported receiving phone calls of buildings shaking, and chopper footage showed multiple buildings being evacuated, including the Government Center on Northwest 1st Street. Miami-Dade Fire Rescue responded to reports of tremors felt at high-rise structures on S. Dadeland Boulevard, officials said. City of Miami Police said there were reports of vibrations in Downtown and Brickell, where some buildings were voluntarily evacuated, though there was no evacuation order. There were no injuries or damages reported, police said.  ""I can't remember in my lifetime there ever being a report of an earthquake being felt in the City of Miami,"" Mayor Francis Suarez said. Jorge Gomez said he and co-workers were on the 47th floor of the Wells Fargo building Downtown when he started feeling the building swaying. ""We were sitting down, we saw the blinds shaking, we felt sick to our stomachs. When I leaned up against the window, I felt my body moving or the window moving,"" Gomez said. ""We were saying 'the building's shaking, the building's shaking.'""  Miami inspectors were responding to buildings in Downtown to check for structural damages, officials said. Dr. Enrique Arango Arias, head of Cuba's National Seismological Service, told state media that there had been no serious damage or injuries reported. Gov. Carlos Joaquín González of Mexico’s Quintana Roo, which is home to Cancun, Tulum and other popular beach resorts, said the earthquake was felt in multiple parts of the low-lying Caribbean state but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize, but issued a later message saying the danger had passed. The quake was felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Roman Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city.  ""It felt very strong but it doesn't look like anything happened,'' she told The Associated Press. It was also felt a little farther east at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the southeastern coast of the island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages, said J. Overton, a spokesman for the installation, which has a total population of about 6,000 people. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands experience so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. “It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,” Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.” Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she saw manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage. Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway. “It felt to me like I was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,” he said. He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica."

      At least 36 people died and more than 1,607 have been hospitalized in eastern Turkey after an earthquake rattled the region on Friday evening, according to state broadcaster TRT Haber.
   
      The 6.7-magnitude quake struck near the town of Sivrice, in eastern Elazig province, causing at least 10 buildings to collapse,  Interior Minister Sulyman Soylu said.
   
      About 1,607 people were hospitalized, Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management President (AFAD) said on Sunday.
   
      At least 45 people have been rescued from collapsed buildings, AFAD said, adding that 1,521 buildings have been inspected, with 76 found to be collapsed and 645 heavily damaged.
   
      Most of the injured were in Elazig province, the epicenter of the earthquake.
   
      Video from Turkey’s IHA Broadcasting Services shows emergency crews rescuing injured people from a collapsed building. 
   
      The earthquake caused five buildings to collapse in Elazig and heavy damage to a number of buildings in the area, Minister of Environment and Urbanization Murat Kurum told reporters.
   
      Preliminary reports say the earthquake lasted 40 seconds, AFAD said, adding that 3,699 search and rescue personnel have been deployed.
   
      Fifteen aftershocks have been felt in the wake, with the strongest registering at 5.4 magnitude, Soylu said. The quake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 10 km (6 miles), according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which enhances the shaking felt at the surface. 
   
      About 500,000 people felt strong to very strong shaking, the USGS reported. The earthquake was felt in several other countries, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.

      At least 36 people died and more than 1,607 have been hospitalized in eastern Turkey after an earthquake rattled the region on Friday evening, according to state broadcaster TRT Haber.
   
      The 6.7-magnitude quake struck near the town of Sivrice, in eastern Elazig province, causing at least 10 buildings to collapse,  Interior Minister Sulyman Soylu said.
   
      About 1,607 people were hospitalized, Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management President (AFAD) said on Sunday.
   
      At least 45 people have been rescued from collapsed buildings, AFAD said, adding that 1,521 buildings have been inspected, with 76 found to be collapsed and 645 heavily damaged.
   
      Most of the injured were in Elazig province, the epicenter of the earthquake.
   
      Video from Turkey’s IHA Broadcasting Services shows emergency crews rescuing injured people from a collapsed building. 
   
      The earthquake caused five buildings to collapse in Elazig and heavy damage to a number of buildings in the area, Minister of Environment and Urbanization Murat Kurum told reporters.
   
      Preliminary reports say the earthquake lasted 40 seconds, AFAD said, adding that 3,699 search and rescue personnel have been deployed.
   
      Fifteen aftershocks have been felt in the wake, with the strongest registering at 5.4 magnitude, Soylu said. The quake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 10 km (6 miles), according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which enhances the shaking felt at the surface. 
   
      About 500,000 people felt strong to very strong shaking, the USGS reported. The earthquake was felt in several other countries, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
   
      The quake interrupted a live broadcast of Edessa TV. Video of the broadcast shows four anchors talking while everything shakes around them.

Magnitude 5.2 earthquake rocks Puerto Rico,2020-01-15 16:46 UTC,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/01/15/52-magnitude-earthquake-rocks-puerto-rico/,"  GUANICA, PUERTO RICO – Another earthquake has hit the island of Puerto Rico, registering magnitude 5.2 on Wednesday. Scientists at the United States Geologic Survey placed the center of the earthquake west-southwest of the town of Guanica. More than 1,280 earthquakes have hit Puerto Rico’s southern region since Dec. 28, more than two dozen of them magnitude 4.5 or greater, according to the USGS. Among them was a 6.4 magnitude quake that hit on Jan. 7, killing one person and injuring nine others, and a 5.9 magnitude aftershock that occurred Saturday, causing further damage. Government officials say the quakes have caused a preliminary $110 million in damage, toppled part of a famed rock formation landmark and damaged or destroyed more than 550 homes. The seismic activity that experts say is unusual but not unexpected has unleashed scientific debate about what’s causing it and drawn international attention to the area, where more than 4,000 people have sought shelter as they wonder when the ground will stop trembling. Scientists say they don’t yet know much about the faults causing the quakes, although some experts believe at least three faults are involved, including the Punta Montalva one in southwest Puerto Rico that students and professors at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayaguez discovered in the early 2000s.

(AP) - California is sending 31 disaster specialists to Puerto Rico after a magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck the island's southern coast on Saturday, the latest in a series of quakes over the past week that have toppled homes and schools and left more than 4,000 people in shelters.  Gov. Gavin Newsom said the deployment comes in response to the Puerto Rican government's request for assistance.

Full power is expected to return to Puerto Rico this weekend after earthquake,2020-01-10 19:22 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/10/us/puerto-rico-earthquake-friday/index.html,"
      A 5.2 magnitude aftershock hit Puerto Rico’s southern coast on Friday afternoon, days after an earthquake shook the island and left much of it without power.
   
      A CNN crew said its truck moved during the aftershock, one of the strongest since Tuesday’s 6.4 magnitude quake. The US Geological Survey revised the magnitude down from an earlier 5.4 reading.
   
      The aftershock came as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, is making aid available and assisting with damage assessment after the quake rocked the island before dawn on Tuesday. It was one of about 500 earthquakes of magnitude 2 or greater that have rattled the area since December 28, according to the US Geological Survey. 
   
      The earthquake left one man dead, caused dozens of homes and other structures to crumble and left about two-thirds of residents in the dark.
   
      The US territory, still recovering from the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, expects to return power to all of its 3 million residents by Saturday, according to utility officials. 
   
      Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with residents to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks.
   
      For many, that has meant bringing mattresses, tents and tarps into their yards to sleep, for fear of what aftershocks could do to their already damaged homes.
   
      Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s non-voting delegate to Congress, spoke at a news conference Friday with Vázquez and Florida Sen. Rick Scott after touring the damaged Costa Sur Power Plant.
   
      She said more than 6,000 people were staying in shelters.  
   
      Vázquez said she had spoken with President Donald Trump to thank him for his support and to urge his prompt approval of a major disaster declaration. 
   
      Myrna Delgado said she sought refuge outside her home when the first temblors started on December 28. She slept in a van and then at a stadium shelter in the southwestern city of Yauco. 
   
      “I’m very nervous,” she told CNN on Friday. “At night I feel very depressed. We don’t have light at home. With the company of other people, at least we feel safe.” 
   
      Noelia de Jesus and her granddaughters are also among those in a shelter. They are also among the many who are looking for a place to stay for the third time, having lost their homes when Hurricane George struck in 1998 and again during Hurricane Maria. 
   
      Luis Garcia, a resident of the southern coastal city of Guayanilla, said he was finding it harder to secure basics such as gas and food than after Hurricane Maria in 2017. 
   
The US Geological Survey (USGS) has modeled three forecasts of what may be in store for Puerto Rico over the next month.
   
      The most likely scenario, the USGS said, is that the aftershocks will continue to decrease in frequency; and though there may be medium and small quakes, there will not be another earthquake like Tuesday’s in this sequence. USGS said the probability of this scenario is 84%.
   
      There a 14% chance of what is called a doublet, which is two large earthquakes of a similar size occurring in a similar location, the USGS said. Meaning there is a case in which the region could see another quake as powerful as 6.4 magnitude. 
   
      Least likely is that Tuesday’s earthquake could trigger an even larger one. While the probability is small, the impacts of that scenario would be devastating, the USGS said.
   
      “The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,” the agency said.
    
      Power has been restored to about 80 percent of Puerto Rico’s 1.4 million utility customers across the island, Puerto Rico Electric Energy Authority said via Twitter on Friday, but the goal is for everyone to have power on Saturday. 
   
      Three of the territory’s major power plants are expected to be in service again by Saturday, with a fourth aimed at operating on Sunday, power utility CEO Jose Ortiz said. 
    
      Officials are also working to reopen schools, which have canceled classes until crews can inspect buildings and ensure their safety for students.
   
      “Classes in the public school system won’t resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,” Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won’t return to the schools until further notice.

Puerto Rico earthquake: Roughly two-thirds of island without power amid dozens of aftershocks,2020-01-08 20:44 UTC,https://myfox8.com/2020/01/08/puerto-rico-earthquake-roughly-two-thirds-of-island-without-power-amid-dozens-of-aftershocks/,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       Roughly two-thirds of Puerto Rico remains without electricity, many still don’t have water and frightened residents were staying outside Wednesday as a series of aftershocks rocked the island following a magnitude 6.4 earthquake. The quake was the strongest and likely the most damaging of hundreds of temblors that have struck the island since December 28. It hit before dawn Tuesday, leaving a man dead and causing dozens of homes and structures to crumble. It was centered off Puerto Rico’s southern coast, 6 miles south of Indios. Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with residents to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks. Terrified of sleeping indoors as aftershocks continue, neighbors put mattresses in their front yards while others spent the night Tuesday under white tents and tarps. Riko Gonzalez and his parents were asleep in their home in Yauco, near Indios, when the big quake struck. They scurried out of the house as dishes tumbled to the kitchen floor, he said. Hundreds of aftershocks have hit the area in the past few days. As of Wednesday afternoon, the island in just 24 hours had experienced about 50 seismic events of magnitude 2.5 or higher, the US Geological Survey said. “People are afraid to go to bed, to then be woken up to worse earthquakes than the day before,” Gonzalez said. Residents and officials have repeatedly said the impact from the quakes surpasses the devastation that Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm when it hit the island, delivered two years ago. “With the hurricane, you knew when and at what time it would arrive,” Guayanilla resident Tatiana Rodriguez, 28, said, adding of the quakes, “This, you don’t know at what time it’s going to happen.” The town of 18,000 located near the southern coast hasn’t been getting regular updates, she said. Residents are disinclined to leave their homes because they don’t know what areas are safe. Rodriguez worries that recovery will be difficult, especially for those hit hard by Maria, she said. “There are a lot of people that started from zero because of Maria,” she said. “(They’re) starting again from zero.” Angela Rodriguez Perez, 22, hasn’t seen her partner since Saturday. He was receiving treatment at a clinic in Guanica, about 12 miles west of Guayanilla, but patients were moved after the quakes and she doesn’t know where he is. She doesn’t think he knows where she is, either, she said. Perez and her relatives, including her 58-year-old father, took shelter at Gloria Maria Borrero School in Guayanilla after Perez’s apartment began “separating from the sidewalk,” she said. She’s been without power for two days, and the balcony of her apartment is “a bit toppled” as well, she told CNN on Tuesday. “I never thought a quake would destroy so much,” she said. “Hurricane Maria was nothing compared to this.” Much of Puerto Rico is still without power Wednesday as engineers work to restore it in phases. About 500,000 customers, roughly one-third of the island, are back on the grid, the Electric Energy Authority said in a tweet. A system-wide power outage was reported after the Costa Sur power plant near Guayanilla suffered severe damage Tuesday, Vázquez Garced said. “We lost the largest plant in the entire system,” said Jose Ortiz, executive director of the Electric Power Authority. Power has been restored in most hospitals, and crews are working to fully restore it by the weekend, Ortiz said. A nursing home in Ponce was evacuated and dozens of people in wheelchairs were waiting outside. Guanica experienced at least 10 aftershocks Wednesday before 8 a.m. (7 a.m. ET), Mayor Santos Seda said. More than 50 homes collapsed, and 100 more are threatening to fall, he said. More than 200 people took shelter at a Guanica coliseum, he said, but fearful for their safety if the building were toppled, they relocated to the parking lot. “So much worse than Maria because a hurricane, we can tell where the hurricane is coming through, but we don’t with an earthquake,” Seda told CNN. “Yesterday, my wife and I slept on the sidewalk right outside my house, and we saw the same thing everywhere.” Classes won’t resume across the island until crews inspect all schools and confirm buildings are safe for students, education officials announced. The Agripina Seda School in Guanica suffered major damage Tuesday, including a partially collapsed, three-story building. “Classes in the public school system won’t resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,” Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won’t return to the schools until further notice. The earthquakes come after Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory in September 2017. Many in southern Puerto Rico said the earthquakes’ damage was worse. “There’s no warnings for this,” Puerto Rico Police Commissioner Henry Escalera said of the earthquakes. “A hurricane gives us time to plan ahead.” When asked what concerns him the most about the quakes’ aftermath, he said, “That homes will not be safe to live in and the possibility of a collapse that will cause a person’s death or serious injuries.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced aid has been made available to supplement local response efforts. President Donald Trump’s action authorizes FEMA to coordinate all disaster relief efforts and provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures to save lives and protect property.

Valley Physician in Puerto Rico Shares Deadly Earthquake Experience,2020-01-08 06:59 UTC,https://www.krgv.com/news/valley-physician-in-puerto-rico-shares-deadly-earthquake-experience,"WESLACO – The aftermath of a deadly earthquake in Puerto Rico being felt by some Rio Grande Valley residents. The earthquake is reported to have started on the southern part of the island, but the shocks were widespread. As of now, a 77-year-old man died and several others have been injured. Betzaida Valentin, a Valley physician currently on vacation visiting Puerto Rico, was just a couple miles away from where the quake hit. “There are houses completely collapsed. Houses, buildings, shopping centers that are completely collapsed. There is a church that was a historical building that is completely down to the grown just one of the walls,” Valentin described. She added this event comes two years after the deadly Hurricane Maria, which reportedly left nearly 3,000 people dead. Watch the video above for the full story.  "
Relief efforts underway in Northeast Ohio for Puerto Rico earthquake victims,2020-01-08 03:51 UTC,https://fox8.com/2020/01/07/relief-efforts-underway-in-northeast-ohio-for-puerto-rico-earthquake-victims/,"Fox 8 Cleveland WJW Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       PARMA, Ohio (WJW) — Relief efforts are underway in Northeast Ohio for Puerto Rico earthquake victims. Joel Rodriguez, 23, of Parma, has relatives there.  He shared pictures and video taken of his family Tuesday morning; his relatives were unable to return to their homes which have cracked walls and homes knocked off foundations. All the devastation caused by two powerful earthquakes just hours apart. “At first, I took it, okay, it happened once; I said, ‘it won’t happen again.’ And then I heard that it kept happening.” Rodriguez spoke with relatives — an aunt, uncles and cousins– throughout the day; many still describing where they were and what they felt when the 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck. “She also said that it felt like the earth was just moving and it was just raised and she said it was the longest minute of her life.” Gerardo Colon, a local firefighter, said his parents and grandparents are still on the island and are okay. “I have some family here in the states, but the majority of them are there, the elders.” Colon was unable to get in contact with them for two weeks after hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017, and this latest natural disaster stirred up old emotions with massive power outages, no water and little food on an island of more than three million people. “They were dealing more with more of the PTSD of blackouts, shortages, stuff like that.” As for now, looking at photos of relatives in prayer is helping to calm fears, as the United States is already setting aside $130 million to deal with the crisis. Colon added, “Hopefully it’ll be over soon and everything will be okay.” Relief efforts are already underway here at home. The Latino American motorcycle club in Lorain is currently collecting medical supplies, canned goods and solar-powered lights. They can be sent or delivered to the Gallagher School, attention Elizabeth Toro, at 6601 Franklin Boulevard, Cleveland, Ohio 44102. Read more, here.

A 6.5 magnitude earthquake hit Puerto Rico a day after another quake rocked the island,2020-01-07 15:56 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/us/puerto-rico-earthquake-tuesday/index.html,"
      Hours after a deadly 6.4 magnitude earthquake rocked Puerto Rico, people on the southern coast fear more homes could collapse and most of the people on the island remain without power.
   
      Tuesday’s quake – the strongest and likely the most damaging of a series of quakes that have hit the island since December 28 – left a man dead, caused dozens of homes and structures to crumble and cut power and water service to swaths of the island. 
   
      Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with people to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks. 
   
      “We have responded to many difficult situations, and here we are once again,” Vázquez said.

      Engineers were working to reestablish service to close to 300,000 of the island’s 1.1 million utility customers who were without water service Tuesday, Vázquez said. 
   
      The 6.4 quake struck at 4:24 a.m. (3:24 a.m. ET). It centered off Puerto Rico’s southern coast, about 6 miles south Indios, a town of about 1,500 people, the US Geological Survey said. Several aftershocks followed, including a magnitude 5.6 temblor striking south of Indios at 7:18 a.m., USGS said. 
   
      In Guanica, families sat on white plastic chairs and cots in the parking lot of the Mariano “Tito” Rodriguez Municipal Coliseum. About 255 have taken shelter there since a 5.8 magnitude quake shook the US territory Monday, but officials now fear the building is not stable. 
   
      “My home is like a hammock,” Guanica resident Hector Cruz said. “It’s like a drill coming from underneath the home.”
   
      The earthquakes come after Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory in September 2017, and many in southern Puerto Rico say the earthquakes’ damage is worse. 
   
      “There’s no warnings for this,” Puerto Rico Police Commissioner Henry Escalera said of the earthquakes. “A hurricane gives us time to plan ahead.”
   
      In Ponce, roughly a 15-mile drive east of Indios, a 77-year-old man was killed and at least eight others were injured Tuesday, the city’s emergency management director, Angel Vasquez, said.
   
      More than 400,000 of Puerto Rico’s 3.1 million people would have felt strong shaking, the USGS estimates, though the entire island would have felt lesser effects.
   
      Authorities provided tents to help residents sleep outdoors Tuesday night, Guanica Deputy Mayor Zulma Bracero said. Nothing seems safe, she said, and the situation is worse than Maria’s aftermath.
   
      Riko Gonzalez and his parents were sleeping in their home in Yauco, near Indios, when the 6.4 quake struck. They awoke to a rumble and scurried out of the house. China and glasses smashed on the kitchen floor, he said.
   
      It was “horrible, nothing compared to the (magnitude) 5s from yesterday,” Gonzalez said. “People are afraid to go to bed, to then be woken up to worse earthquakes than the day before.”
   Más de nuestros hermanos de Guayanilla. ¡Oremos! 
      In Guayanilla, north of Indios, the Inmaculada Conception Church was in ruins. Part of an exterior wall collapsed, and piles of rubble lay on the ground, pictures posted to Facebook show.
   
      Homes also were damaged in Guayanilla, Mayor Nelson Torres told CNN affiliate WAPA.
   
      The Guayanilla area already was counting losses from a day earlier. A significant tourist attraction, the coastal Punta Ventana rock formation and arch, collapsed in Monday’s shaking, the mayor said.
   
      Workers at Hospital Damas in Ponce were evacuating all patients except for those in intensive care, Executive Director Dr. Pedro Benitez told WAPA.
   
      “(Patients) were running around the hallways, so we had to get them out of the building for their own safety,” he said.
   
      Tuesday’s quake continues a series of seismic events that have shaken Puerto Rico for 11 days. Hundreds of small earthquakes have hit the island since December 28, the USGS says, including at least 29 over magnitude 4.0.
   
Monday morning’s 5.8 tremor struck south of Indios. The quake damaged some homes in Guanica and Guayanilla, but no serious injuries were reported.
   
      The earthquakes appear to have been foreshocks to Tuesday morning’s larger quake, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said.
   
      Tuesday’s quake “will trigger aftershocks, but these will decrease in frequency over time,” the USGS said.
   
      It likely will be the island’s most damaging earthquake in a century. 
   
      In 1918, a strong quake shook Puerto Rico, causing a tsunami and resulting in 116 deaths and economic loss of $4 million, two times the island’s annual budget at the time, according to the Puerto Rico Seismic Network. That’s about $73 million today.
   
      It’s the largest earthquake to hit Puerto Rico since 2014, when a 6.4 magnitude quake struck 61 miles northeast of the island. It briefly disrupted power but caused only minor damage to Puerto Rico, as it was centered much father off shore than Tuesday’s earthquake.
   
      The full extent of damages is unclear, but experts say the island could need hundreds of millions of dollars in aid.
   
      One expert, Chuck Watson, an analyst with Georgia-based disaster research group Enki Research, believes the quakes could cost the island up to $3.1 billion in losses, he said.
   
      The estimate includes damage to public and private property, and lost tourism, wages and business due to power outages. USGS estimates the earthquakes could cause  losses of more than $100 million. 
   
      Watson’s estimate includes how multiple aftershocks can potentially damage weak structures, as well as the lingering damage left by Hurricane Maria, he said. Some of the infrastructure damage from the 2017 storm still is not repaired, the American Society of Civil Engineers says.
   
      Following hurricanes Irma and Maria, Congress appropriated $42 billion to the recovery effort, $16 billion of which went through FEMA, $20 billion through Housing and Urban Development, and the remainder through more than a dozen smaller agencies.
   
      Only about $14 billion of the funds has been spent.

          / CBS Miami
         SAN JUAN (CBSMiami/AP) -- A 6.4 magnitude earthquake and several other strong tremors rocked Puerto Rico Tuesday morning, killing one man and injuring at least eight others. It happened just one day after a 5.8 magnitude quake shook the island, according to the US Geological Survey. The earthquake caused buildings to collapse in the southern part of the island and was followed by a series of strong aftershocks, part of a 10-day series of temblors spawned by the grinding of tectonic plates along three faults beneath southern Puerto Rico. CBS4's Peter D'Oench spoke with people on Tuesday inside the baggage claim area at Miami International Airport after arriving from Puerto Rico.  ""Yesterday and today, it was crazy,"" said Jesuan Ruiz. ""I was in my parents' house and the glasses were breaking down along with the dinner table. A lot of stuff came down. I went with my kid and tried to stay on top of him because I was afraid the ceiling would fall down. You could hear the sound. It was like woo, woo, woo and It was really a scary experience. I wanted to get my family off the island but it was very expensive."" ""It was absolutely terrifying and the actual shock was very scary,"" recalled Robert Lopez Erezarri. ""In one sense we were lucky it struck so early in the morning because if later, a lot of people out and about could have been hurt."" Francis Rodriguez was with her family. ""During the earthquake it was very frightening. Some things shifted all over the place. We have not experienced earthquakes like this in over a hundred years."" Many residents are still shaken by memories of Hurricane Maria in September of 2017.  It devastated the island and killed nearly 3,000 people. Some authorities have said most of the island's infrastructure is in ""poor condition."" Miami resident Melinda Mizrachi spent her entire two-week Christmas vacation in Puerto Rico where she has family and a second home and felt the ground moving while she was there. ""I am not sure on what the magnitudes were, but I know one of them was at least a 5 and I was in my living room laying down on my sofa and my whole entire sofa was shaking and moving. I felt like I was on a rollercoaster ride,"" described Mizrachi to CBSMiami.com. Puerto Rico experienced a flurry of earthquakes since December 28, according to data from the USGS, ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to Sunday's 5.8. All of the earthquakes appear to have been foreshocks to Tuesday morning's largest quake. Melinda and her teenage son returned to Miami on Sunday night, just before the two biggest earthquakes struck. ""I don't know how my house is at the moment, but I have been told by a friend of mine that lives in my same neighborhood that the whole entire island is without power,"" she said. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority is reporting widespread outages across the island after power plants shutdown to protect themselves. Authorities said two plants suffered light damage and they expected power to be restored later Tuesday.  ""My heart is broken,"" said Mizrachi. ""I am happy that my son and I were able to get off of the island, but a part of me wishes I was back there by myself being able to help out any way that I can. The island has just started to get back to some kind of normal from Hurricane Maria and to see this now and seeing pictures of homes, roads and buildings collapsing is just devastating to me.  I am scheduled to go back there next month to run a half marathon but now I just want to go just to assess the damages to my home and help out any way that I can."" Due to the recent earthquakes, Nova Southeastern University's Puerto Rico Regional Campus is closed Tuesday. All classes are suspended, including for online students. Seismologists say it's impossible to predict when the quakes will stop. CBS4 also spoke with Professor Jorge Duany, who is an expert on Puerto Rico and is also Director of the Cuban Research Institute at F.I.U. ""One of the most immediate concerns is that residents are scared and people are leaving the island but I think that will be a short term impact. I think the most important long term impact will be the structural damage to properties. There are hundreds of thousands of homes that could be vulnerable to earthquakes, particularly areas near the coast that are prone to flooding and tsunamis."" Duany said the island was still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Maria three years ago and the turbulent times during protests against the island's Governor. Duany said the island's population was holding at 3.2 million and had stopped its decline after an exodus of some residents after Maria. (© Copyright 2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Magnitude-5.8 earthquake strikes off the coast of Puerto Rico,2020-01-06 12:26 UTC,https://www.wkbw.com/news/national/magnitude-5-8-earthquake-strikes-off-the-coast-of-puerto-rico,"Menu  SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A 5.8-magnitude quake hit Puerto Rico before dawn Monday, unleashing small landslides, causing power outages and severely cracking some homes.

Dr. Sindia Alvarado, who lives in the southern coastal town of Penuelas, said she was petrified. “My entire family woke up screaming,” she said. “I though the house was going to crack in half.” At a hotel in the southwest coastal town of Guanica, people panicked as they tried to flee in their cars, only to realize that large boulders were obstructing the only highway heading north to the capital of San Juan, attorney Jose Francisco Benitez told the AP. “There was a state of panic,” he said. “There were even people in their underwear walking around the hotel.” He said he and his girlfriend were in the room when the quake struck. “I have never felt anything like this,” he said. “It was like a giant grabbed our room and shook it.” The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico’s southern region began the night of Dec. 28, with quakes ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to 5.1. Previous quakes of lesser magnitudes in recent days have cracked homes and led to goods falling off supermarket shelves.  One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a 7.3-magnitude quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.

Earthquake felt across southern New England,2020-11-08 16:41 UTC,https://www.kxii.com/2020/11/08/earthquake-felt-in-massachusetts-rhode-island/,"BOSTON (AP) — The strongest earthquake to hit southern New England in decades rattled homes and nerves Sunday morning, but didn’t cause any significant damage, authorities said. The 3.6 magnitude earthquake centered off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts, in Buzzards Bay struck just after 9 a.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Earthquake Information Center. The earthquake hit at a depth of a little more than 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) and was felt across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and into Connecticut and Long Island, New York. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a magnitude 3.5 temblor hit in March 1976, said Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist. About 14,000 people went to the agency’s website to report the earthquake, including people from Easthampton, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut, both about 100 miles (160 kilometers) away, and several from more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) away in Boston, he said. That’s not unusual in New England. “It’s common for them to be felt very far away because the rock here is old and continuous and transmits the energy a long way,” Caruso said. Ali Kenner Brodsky, who lives in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, not far from the epicenter, was sitting in her kitchen talking with her son, when it hit. “It was a rumbling. It sounded like something exploded. It rumbled. The whole house shook,” she said. She said it lasted around 10 to 15 seconds. “In that moment, it feels like it’s going on forever.” Her husband, Sam, ran to the basement because he thought the boiler blew up. Magnitude 3.6 earthquakes rarely cause major damage, Caruso said. Chris Besse, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said it had not received any reports of injuries or significant damage. Later Sunday, Besse in an email said there were reports of some structural damage to buildings in New Bedford, and urged anyone who felt the earthquake to check for such damage. The Red Cross tweeted that it was helping 21 people, including children, who had been displaced from their New Bedford homes. There were other reports of minor damage. Police in Fall River tweeted that they received numerous phone calls about the quake, including reports of items falling off of shelves, and street signs getting uprooted. ___ Associated Press reporter Michelle Smith in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.

The Red Cross is reporting that multiple families have been displaced after their homes were damaged by an earthquake that struck off the Massachusetts coast Sunday morning.  According to the USGS, the quake struck at a depth of approximately 6.2 miles.  Initially, the USGS report indicated the magnitude of the earthquake may have been as high as 4.2. That was later revised downward to 4.0 and then again to 3.6. ""You know, when you hear earthquake, your mind starts to race,"" Mattapoisett resident Kyle Jones said. ""I was expecting to open the door and see a crack in the ground or something."" NewsCenter 5 received reports of people feeling the earthquake from New Bedford to East Bridgewater, up to Natick and as far as Granby and Gloucester. U.S. Rep. Bill Keating, who lives on Cape Cod, was among those who felt the rumble. ""All of a sudden, the house shook,"" Keating said. ""The only way I could describe it was it was just like an explosion without the sound."" Residents of Rhode Island, Connecticut and even New Hampshire also reported feeling the earthquake. USGS geophysicist Paul Caruso told The Associated Press that about 14,000 people went to the agency's website to report the earthquake, including people from Easthampton, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut, which are about 100 miles away from the epicenter. Caruso also said the USGS received several reports of the earthquake from Boston residents, who were more than 50 miles away from the quake. The Red Cross of Massachusetts told NewsCenter 5 that three New Bedford homes in the area of Crapo and Nelson streets had to be evacuated due to structural damage caused by the earthquake. As a result, 10 families totaling 22 people have been displaced. The New Bedford Fire Department reports that the bottom 4 feet of the chimney stack on the home at 202 Crapo St. had completely crumbled, and that pipes from the furnaces were leaning over. As a result, the gas had to be shut off in the building, leaving the residents without heat, hot water or stoves. Firefighters said a home across the street, at 195 Crapo St., had the same damage as the home at 202 Crapo St., as the chimney stack had completely crumbled. The home's gas lines also had to be shut down. While checking other house in the area, firefighters said a nearby six-family home had multiple carbon monoxide leaks, and that gas service had to be shut off. ""If you see any signs of cracking, or certainly crumbling, of your chimney in the basement -- or anywhere in your house -- you should look up on your roof and check out your chimney,"" New Bedford District Fire Chief James Fortin said. According to the Red Cross, the property manager for the homes is working with the agency to help provide lodging support for the affected residents.  ""We will provide comfort and long-term recovery services,"" the Red Cross tweeted Sunday afternoon. # Red Cross responding to a EQK- Earthquake in  #New Bedford where more than 20 adults and an unknown number of children are reportedly displaced.

Strong Aegean Sea Earthquake Topples Buildings in Turkey,2020-10-30 08:50 UTC,https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/national-international/strong-aegean-sea-earthquake-topples-buildings-in-turkey/2352747/,"Rescue teams on Saturday plowed through concrete blocks and the debris of eight collapsed buildings in search of survivors of a powerful earthquake that struck Turkey’s Aegean coast and north of the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 27 people. More than 800 others were injured. The quake hit Friday afternoon, toppling buildings in Izmir, Turkey’s third largest city, and triggering a small tsunami in the district of Seferihisar and on Samos. The quake was followed by hundreds of aftershocks. Early on Saturday, onlookers cheered as rescuers lifted teenager Inci Okan out of the rubble of a devastated eight-floor apartment block in Izmir's Bayrakli district. Her dog, Fistik, was also rescued, Sozcu newspaper reported. Friends and relatives waited outside the building for news of loved ones still trapped inside, including employees of a dentist’s surgery that was located on the ground floor. In another collapsed building, rescuers made contact with a 38-year-old woman and her four children — aged 3, 7 and 10-year old twins — and were working to clear a corridor to bring them out, state-run Anadolu Agency reported.  Two other women, aged 53 and 35, were brought out from the rubble of another toppled two-story building earlier on Saturday. In all, around 100 people have been rescued since the earthquake, Murat Kurum, the environment and urban planning minister, told reporters.  Some 5,000 rescue personnel were working on the ground, Kurum said.  At least 25 people were killed in Izmir, including an elderly woman who drowned, according to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD.  Two teenagers were killed on Samos after being struck by a collapsing wall. At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said.  The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. The earthquake, which the Istanbul-based Kandilli Institute said had a magnitude of 6.9, was centered in the Aegean northeast of Samos. AFAD said it measured 6.6. and hit at a depth of some 16 kilometers (10 miles).  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as Athens and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul’s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey’s largest. Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 87,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece too. Authorities warned residents in Izmir not to return to damaged buildings, saying they could collapse in strong aftershocks. Many people spent the night out in the streets, too frightened to return to their homes, even if they sustained no damage, the DHA news agency reported. More than 3,000 rescue personnel were sent to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens.  In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity while the presidents of Greece and Turkey held a telephone conversation. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and NATO allies. ___ Becatoros reported from Athens.

         A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck off the Alaska Peninsula on Monday afternoon, triggering a tsunami warning in the region. The warning was downgraded to an advisory within a few hours, and then was lifted entirely later Monday after waves about 2 feet high rolled onto the shore in some areas.  Some schools on the peninsula were evacuated earlier in the day, but there were no reports of damage.  Emergency sirens were activated in Alaska and the Kodiak Emergency Operations Center monitored the situation, CBS affiliate KTVA-TV reported. Police in the city of Homer urged residents in low elevation areas to move to higher ground while the alert was in place. David Adams, a co-manager of a bed and breakfast in Sand Point, told The Associated Press that the quake ""was a pretty good shaker here"" and said ""the structure itself is sound."" He also said that all guests were accounted for. ""It just kind of happened all of a sudden,"" he added. A Cold Bay, Alaska, resident shared video from her living room as she and her three children huddled under a table when the quake rattled their home, KTVA-TV said. ""We are getting very accustomed to these earthquakes, and I've learned to just accept that this is what we have to endure when we decide to live between volcanoes and an active plate, the ring of fire,"" Candace Nielsen told the station. The tsunami warning has been downgraded to a tsunami advisory, but aftershocks keep hitting communities near Sand Point... The National Weather Service in Los Angeles and San Diego said there was no tsunami threat to the West Coast. An advisory was put in place Monday afternoon for the Hawaiian islands, but again there were no reports of large waves or any damage.

Tsunami warning issued after 7.5 earthquake off Alaska's Aleutian Islands,2020-10-19 23:44 UTC,https://www.wric.com/news/u-s-world/tsunami-warning-issued-after-7-5-earthquake-off-alaskas-aleutian-islands/,"WRIC ABC 8News Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       SAND POINT, Alaska (NewsNation Now) — A magnitude 7.5 earthquake prompted a tsunami warning Monday for a nearly thousand-mile stretch of Alaska’s southern coast, with waves over 2 feet at the nearest community as the threat subsided. The National Tsunami Warning Center issued the warning for South Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, Pacific coasts from Kennedy Entrance, Alaska to Unimak Pass, Alaska, including Sand Point, Cold Bay and Kodiak, which are sparsely populated. The quake was centered near Sand Point, a city of about 900 people off the Alaska Peninsula where wave levels late Monday topped 2 feet according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. The warning was downgraded to an advisory just over two hours after the quake hit. It was lifted later Monday night. “It was a pretty good shaker here,” said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. “You could see the water kind of shaking and shimmering during the quake. Our truck was swaying big time.” Raynelle Gardner, a secretary at Sand Point School in the Aleutians East Borough School District, said things were hectic because “this is an evacuation point.” Some schools in the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District were evacuated to higher ground, the district said on Twitter. Public safety officials in King Cove sent out an alert urging residents in the coastal area to move inland to higher ground. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center tweeted that a tsunami with a height of 2 feet was observed at Sand Point, Alaska. The size of the quake was originally reported as a magnitude of 7.4, but was revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said an earthquake of this size, in this area, is not a surprise. “This is an area where the Pacific Plate is subducting underneath the North American Plate. And because of that, the Pacific Plate actually goes underneath the North American Plate, where it melts,” Caruso said, noting that’s why there are volcanoes in the region. “And so we commonly have large, magnitude 7 earthquakes in that area.” If you are in a tsunami warning area, you should evacuate inland or to higher ground above and beyond designated tsunami hazard zones or move to an upper floor of a multi-story building based on your situation.  The Alaska Earthquake Center said the quake was widely felt in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula. The Alaska Earthquake Center said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. Later on Monday night, a Tsunami Advisory was issued for the State of Hawaii, but there wasn’t expected to be a major Tsunami.   Read more information from tsunami.gov.

The magnitude 7.5 earthquake near Sand Point, Alaska, generated a tsunami, Scott Langley with the National Tsunami Warning Center said Monday afternoon. Langley said the tsunami sent two waves, each measuring 4 feet, 3 inches high. But observers onshore reported the waves appeared to be 1.5 feet and 2 feet over high tide. The center is monitoring harbors in a 500-mile area along the Alaska coastline, he said. Tsunami advisories issued for parts of Alaska and the state of Hawaii following the earthquake were canceled Monday night, according to tweets from the National Weather Service Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (NWS PTWC). Langley said earlier the area in Alaska that had been subject to the warning and advisory is ""pretty remote."" ""For other US and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America, there is no tsunami threat,"" the center said. The earthquake's epicenter was recorded less than 60 miles from Sand Point, near the Aleutian Peninsula in the southwestern part of the state. ""We did feel it,"" Sand Point Clinic employee Lorna Osterback said of the quake. ""This is a big one."" Osterback said residents of the town would be heading to higher ground away from the shoreline as they wait out the tsunami threat. ""We expect we will have another one in about half an hour,"" noted Osterback. ""We're right on the fault line. I grew up here and it's kind of normal."" Jeanette Piniones Navales moved her family from Kodiak Island to higher ground on Pillar Mountain when the tsunami alerts sounded Monday. She said she has lived in Kodiak since 2014 and this is her sixth time experiencing a tsunami warning. ""I got nervous and immediately convinced my family to move (to) high ground to be safe,"" she told CNN. Candace Nelson, her kids and dogs hid under the table as the earthquake shook Cold Bay, about 90 miles west of Sand Point. ""My kids are all doing good. Brooke, Wilder and Scout all huddled under our kitchen table till the shaking stopped,"" she told CNN as the family waited for more news about the tsunami. ""The dogs were more concerned as to what the heck we were doing under the table."" Residents of Homer could also be seen driving to higher ground after being given evacuation orders. Several aftershocks, including one with a magnitude of 5.9 and one that was 5.8, struck in the hour after the big quake.

JUNEAU, Alaska -- A reported 7.5 magnitude earthquake off the Alaska Peninsula on Monday prompted tsunami warnings for a vast swath of communities.

The size of the quake was originally reported to have been a magnitude of 7.4, but has been revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.

Unalaska officials sent out a message saying the city is just outside the warning zone and they aren't ordering evacuations right now. Unalaska public safety officials earlier Monday had sent out a release saying they would be conducting tests of the community's tsunami warning sirens.

SAN DIEGO – A swarm of mostly small earthquakes were reported Wednesday afternoon in Imperial County, the largest of which was recorded at a magnitude of 4.9, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The agency has recorded nearly 200 quakes of a magnitude of 1 or greater within about a three-mile radius of the 4.9 magnitude quake near Westmorland, a small city in Imperial County north of El Centro, according to Rob Graves, a research geophysicist with USGS. Graves said it’s “not uncommon and certainly not unheard of” for a swarm of earthquakes to be recorded in the area of the Salton Sea, located north of Westmorland. The area has a complex web of faults between the San Andreas Fault Zone to the north and the Imperial Fault Zone to the south, he said.  “The No. 1 takeaway is that this is a reminder that we’re all living in earthquake country,” Graves said. “We’re in Southern California or California. In general, earthquakes are going to happen. Every once in a while, it’s going to be a large, damaging earthquake.” He adds, “I can’t say with 100% certainty what’s going to happen with this swarm activity, but what I take away from that is that it’s a reminder to be prepared.” According to agency modeling, Graves said the most likely scenario is that similar activity will continue for another day or two. Less likely, he said, would be for a larger quake — between magnitudes 5.5 and 6.5 — to hit the area.  “Most likely is that they’ll continue, possibly up to magnitude above 5,” he said. “But over the next week or so, that’s going to taper off and kind of go back down to the typical level.” A similar swarm of quakes was reported in the area in 2012, according to Graves. In August, USGS reported a dozen small quakes in roughly the same area, which drew concern from SDSU professor and geologist Pat Abbott. The agency reported ripples of the quake were felt north of the Salton Sea and to the south near the U.S.-Mexico border as well as in parts of San Diego County. No injuries or damage have been reported thus far.  #ShakingNews here's been a swarm of earthquakes that have been rattling the Brawley/ElCentro area since 4p, The biggest one, a 4.9, was felt in San Diego.#readyforthebigone #beprepared #quakeaware Just felt #earthquake from Mission Valley… rocking back and forth for couple seconds

"Financial help approved for residents, businesses impacted by N.C. earthquake",2020-08-29 00:44 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/28/financial-help-approved-residents-businesses-impacted-by-nc-earthquake/,"SPARTA, N.C. (WBTV) - Financial help has now been approved for residents and businesses impacted by the 5.1 magnitude earthquake that shook North Carolina earlier this month.  The U.S. Small Business Administration granted Governor Roy Cooper’s request for a disaster declaration for homeowners and small businesses that suffered damage from the 5.1 magnitude earthquake centered near Sparta in Alleghany County on Aug. 9. “This SBA approval will provide much-needed help to our homeowners and small businesses who are coping with structural damage from this strong quake,” said Governor Cooper. “Additionally, I have signed a state disaster declaration to provide state-funded assistance for those who don’t qualify for SBA aid.” The initial damage assessments reported more than 500 structures were impacted by the earthquake.  The SBA damage assessment survey confirmed 43 buildings suffered heavy damage of more than 40 percent of the building’s value, including 38 homes and 5 businesses. The declaration authorizes low-interest disaster loans to residents and businesses who suffered losses in Alleghany County and the contiguous counties of Ashe, Surry and Wilkes in North Carolina and Grayson County in Virginia.  SBA Disaster Loans provide up to $200,000 to homeowners and up to $2 million to businesses to repair and/or replace damaged property.  Homeowners and renters would also be eligible for loans up to $40,000 to repair or replace damaged personal property. For those who do not meet the qualifications for an SBA low-interest disaster loan, state individual assistance grants are available. A disaster recovery center will open Monday afternoon in Sparta for affected residents to apply for assistance.  Residents should call 336-372-2999, to make an appointment so that social distancing can be maintained in the recovery center.  Businesses and individuals may also obtain information and loan applications by calling the SBA’s Customer Service Center at 1-800-659-2955 (1-800-877-8339 for the deaf and hard-of-hearing), or by emailing disastercustomerservice@sba.gov.

 A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck near the Alaskan peninsula late Tuesday, shaking buildings, but there were no immediate reports of injuries and the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center canceled an earlier warning of potentially hazardous waves. In Kodiak, the largest community in the earthquake area on an island south of Anchorage, some residents posted video on social media of people walking up to the high school, which was serving as a shelter, and of sirens sounding alarms. The quake struck off the coast, 105 km (65 miles) south-south east of Perryville, Alaska at a depth of 28 km, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). It had prompted the Tsunami Warning Center to issue a warning for the coastal areas of south Alaska, the Alaskan Peninsula and Aleutian Islands.  Jeremy Zidek, spokesman for the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said emergency officials were trying to contact people in all the affected communities. The closest is Sand Point, a town of about 1,000 on another island off the tip of the Alaskan Peninsula. Sand Point has evacuated and sounded its emergency sirens, Zidek said.

Magnitude 5.8 earthquake strikes in southern Sierra Nevada about 160 miles north of Los Angeles,2020-06-24 18:33 UTC,https://www.wtnh.com/news/magnitude-5-8-earthquake-strikes-in-southern-sierra-nevada-about-160-miles-north-of-los-angeles/,"WTNH.com Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       A magnitude 5.8 earthquake struck the Eastern Sierra region about 160 miles north of Los Angeles Wednesday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.  USGS initially listed the magnitude as 6.1 and the epicenter at a GPS point about 20 miles southwest of Lone Pine in the Sierra Nevada range.  But the agency’s updated quake information downgraded the magnitude and indicated the epicenter was in the mostly dry Owens Lake bed, about 10 miles south-southeast of Lone Pine. The location is the center of the Owens Valley and the site of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power water facilities. The Los Angeles Aqueduct, which sends water to the city of L.A.’s more than 4 million residents, is just a few miles from the epicenter. It wasn’t immediately clear if any equipment was damaged. The aqueduct, more than a century old, has survived many earthquakes.   Lone Pine, a town of about 2,000 residents, is known in part for the nearby filming of many classic western films. In 1872, Lone Pine was largely destroyed and many residents were killed in an earthquake that’s now believed to be a magnitude 7.4, one of the largest in recorded California history. Wednesday’s temblor prompted reports of a rockslide and debris on two main roads that lead into the mountains, the Inyo County Sheriff’s Office said on Facebook. Local Sierra Wave radio reported little immediate damage, though a cleanup was in the works at a Lone Pine hardware store. The quake was felt throughout Central California and parts of Southern California. The more than 10,000 respondents to USGS’s “Did You Feel It?” page indicated they experienced the temblor in Las Vegas, Reno and the San Francisco Bay Area as well. Several aftershocks shook the area, including one with a 4.6 magnitude, according to USGS. The quake struck in the same location as a magnitude 4.6 temblor earlier in the week, famed seismologist Lucy Jones said on Twitter. That earthquake is now considered a foreshock, she said. We just had a M5.8 south of Lone Pine in the Owens Valley. It is the same location as the M4.6 two nights ago. That is now considered a foreshock Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

         LONE PINE (CBS SF) -- A 5.8 magnitude earthquake rattled Inyo County near the eastern Sierra Nevada town of Lone Pine Wednesday, sending tons of boulders and debris crashing down at the Whitney Portal camping area.  The Into County Sheriff's Department posted on Facebook that they have closed the popular camping spot. ""The campgrounds are being evacuated due to rockslide south of the main parking lot,"" the post read. ""No injuries were reported at this time... It is believed that this slide was triggered by the recent 5.8 earthquake near the Lone Pine area."" Rockslide near Whitney Portal However, they said it was ""unclear at this time if the main Mt Whitney trail has been affected."" Deputies did post that Horseshoe Meadows Road was closed due to rocks and debris. ""I was in that parking lot when it happened,"" Christine Defendi posted on Facebook along with a photo of the large dust cloud kicked up by the slide. The Whitney Portal is the gateway to Mt. Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States and is the trailhead for the Mt. Whitney Trail.   It has been followed by more than a dozen aftershocks ranging in magnitude from 4.6 to 2.5. On Monday night, the same area was struck by a 4.6-magnitude temblor.  There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries elsewhere. The quake was felt as far away as Bakersfield, Stockton and throughout the Central Valley.

Many are still checking their homes for damage, including Eason.  “You can see how it cracked right there, all the way down there, right down that way,” she noted, pointing out some of the damage to the interior.  Eason is unable to open the a window in the bedroom and also discovered cracks outside.

As Tonopah is a mining town, there was concern about the mines. We have not heard yet of any major damage to them.  “We have a web of mine shafts through Tonopah, so it was my one thought that we were going to be swallowed up because they are all over town and go deep in the ground,” explained Wilson.  Some longtime residents said they never felt an earthquake so intense.  “I have lived here all my life and never felt an earthquake like this morning,” said Wilson. 8 News Now did not find any major damage while in the town.

Utah earthquake damages Mormon temple and knocks trumpet from iconic angel statue,2020-03-19 00:08 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/us/earthquake-salt-lake-temple-moroni/index.html,"
      The 5.7-magnitude earthquake that shook Utah Wednesday morning also dislodged a symbolic part of Salt Lake City’s iconic Mormon temple: the trumpet of an angel statue atop its highest spire. 
   
      The temple is the spiritual focal point for the 16 million members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   
      “The trumpet on the Angel Moroni statue fell off, and there is minor displacement of some of the temple’s smaller spire stones,” said Daniel Woodruff, a spokesman for the church. 
   
      The earthquake didn’t injure any workers, Woodruff said, adding that the Salt Lake Temple has been closed to the public while undergoing a seismic upgrade. 
   
      In addition to Moroni’s trumpet falling off, some the temple’s smaller spire stones were displaced, the church said. No other damage was reported.
   
      Aerial photos show the fallen trumpet appeared to land on the roof of the temple near the base of its spires.
    
      The Salt Lake Temple, dedicated in 1893, was the first temple topped with Angel Moroni, according to the church. The 12-foot-5-inch statue, made of copper and gold leaf, stands on a stone ball atop the 210-foot central spire on the east side of the temple.
   
      An iconic symbol of the faith, Moroni stands atop most of the Mormon church’s 134 temples worldwide. 
   
      The church teaches that Moroni was an ancient prophet who led Mormonism’s founder, Joseph Smith, to the golden plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated. Moroni’s horn, the church says, symbolizes spreading the message of the restoration of Christianity that Mormons believe was begun by Smith. 
   
      The quake was centered about 10 miles west of Salt Lake City, near the city of Magna, starting at 7:09 a.m. MT, the US Geological Survey said. It’s the state’s most powerful quake since 1992, Utah’s Division of Emergency Management said.

"Small Earthquake Hits Northern Italy, Prompting Emergency Calls",2020-03-10 15:54 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/small-earthquake-hits-northern-italy-prompting-emergency-calls_3266732.html,"A small earthquake hit northern Italy on Tuesday as the country is grappling with the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. A 2.9-magnitude earthquake struck about 10 miles northwest of Pisa near Tuscany, said the European Mediterranean Seismological Center.  — EMSC (@LastQuake) March 10, 2020  
According to state-backed ANSA, the quake had an epicenter in the Lucca province in Tuscany, a depth of five miles, and a magnitude of 2.6. There were no initial reports of damage.
Local residents in the area “clearly felt vibrations from the ground” and a “roar from the subsoil,” ANSA wrote. It prompted numerous calls to firefighters.
The tremor comes as Italy works to stave off the COVID-19 outbreak across the country. More than 9,000 people have been infected while at least 450 deaths have been confirmed as of Tuesday by Italian authorities.
Extraordinary measures were announced by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Monday evening to essentially quarantine the entire country. Travel between Italy’s regions and inside them has been banned unless it is necessary for work, health, or other serious reasons.
“There won’t be just a red zone,” Conte told reporters, adding that all of Italy will be “a protected area.”
Italians’ “habits must be changed now,” Conte said. “We must all give up something for the good of Italy” and “we must do it immediately and we will only succeed if we will all work together and adapt to these stricter standards.”
 According to state-backed ANSA, the quake had an epicenter in the Lucca province in Tuscany, a depth of five miles, and a magnitude of 2.6. There were no initial reports of damage. Local residents in the area “clearly felt vibrations from the ground” and a “roar from the subsoil,” ANSA wrote. It prompted numerous calls to firefighters. The tremor comes as Italy works to stave off the COVID-19 outbreak across the country. More than 9,000 people have been infected while at least 450 deaths have been confirmed as of Tuesday by Italian authorities. Extraordinary measures were announced by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Monday evening to essentially quarantine the entire country. Travel between Italy’s regions and inside them has been banned unless it is necessary for work, health, or other serious reasons. “There won’t be just a red zone,” Conte told reporters, adding that all of Italy will be “a protected area.” Italians’ “habits must be changed now,” Conte said. “We must all give up something for the good of Italy” and “we must do it immediately and we will only succeed if we will all work together and adapt to these stricter standards.” Share this with everyone!"

Please enter a search term.       ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Nine people were killed in eastern Turkey by a magnitude 5.7 earthquake early Sunday morning, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. The quake centered just east across the border in neighboring Iran, west of the Iranian city of Khoy, and affected villages in the Turkish province of Van. At least three of the dead were children, according to Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. The health minister later said at least 37 people were injured, including nine in critical but not life-threatening condition. Iran’s official IRNA news agency said at least 75 people had been injured inside Iran, six of whom were hospitalized. A second earthquake — also magnitude 5.7 — struck Sunday evening in the same area in Iran, according to the country’s seismology center. It was not immediately clear if the second quake caused further damage or casualties in either country. The U.S. Geological Survey put the second earthquake’s magnitude at 6.0. Varying magnitudes are common in the immediate aftermath. Turkish broadcaster NTV showed images of locals and soldiers digging through the rubble of collapsed buildings on Sunday, as families sat in snowy streets fearing further tremors. Emergency teams were sent to the remote mountainous region, which has a history of powerful earthquakes. Last month, a quake centered on the eastern Turkish city of Elazig killed more than 40 people. In 2011, more than 600 were killed when a quake struck north of Van province’s capital.   The USGS said the first quake was at a depth of 6.4 kilometers (4 miles) and the second was at 10 kilometers (6 miles). The effects of the quake hit four villages in Van. Seven of the fatalities occurred in Ozpinar village, where Soylu said search and rescue teams had arrived. He added that the quake caused 1,066 buildings to collapse while the Education Ministry said a number of schools were damaged. Koca said 25 ambulances, a medical helicopter and 13 emergency teams had been sent to the region. The Disaster and Emergency Management Directorate (AFAD) said 144 tents for families had been dispatched. IRNA said the first earthquake affected 43 villages in the mountainous Qotour area.

      A magnitude 5 earthquake on Tuesday struck Puerto Rico, where people are still on edge from a series of quakes after last month’s deadly 6.4 temblor.
   
      It was the 11th earthquake of at least that size in the past 30 days, according to the US Geological Survey. 
   
      The earthquake’s center was 13 miles southeast of Guanica on the southwest coast, according to the US Geological Survey. 
   
      Shelters were already emptying shortly after the quake hit at 10:45 a.m., but it left several municipal employees “requiring emotional assistance,” Guayanilla Mayor Nelson Torres Yordan told newspaper El Nuevo Dia. 
    
      The magnitude 6.4 earthquake on January 7 left one person dead, destroyed dozens of homes and structures, and left 300,000 without water and two-thirds of the island without power. 
   
      Since late December, a series of quakes – about 500 of magnitude 2 or greater – have rattled Puerto Rico, hitting infrastructure already weakened from Category 5 Hurricane Maria that struck the island in September 2017.

Courtesy of the Associated Press    Courtesy of the Associated Press    HAVANA (AP) – A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday, shaking a vast area from Mexico to Florida and beyond, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or heavy damage.  The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. “It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,” she told The Associated Press. It was also felt a little further east at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the southeastern coast of the island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages, said J. Overton, a spokesman for the installation, which has a total population of about 6,000 people. Several South Florida buildings were being evacuated as a precaution, according to the city of Miami and Miami-Dade County officials. No injuries or road closures have been reported. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands see so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. “It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,” Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.” Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she had seen manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage. Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway. “It felt to me like I was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,” he said. He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize. The USGS initially reported the magnitude at 7.3. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

A magnitude 7.7 earthquake occurred between Cuba and Jamaica on Tuesday afternoon. The epicenter was located in the Caribbean Sea about 83 miles north of Montego Bay, the capital of St. James, and about 87 miles south of Granma, Cuba, according to the United States Geological Survey service. It was a relatively strong but shallow quake with a depth of about 6 miles. A 7.7 magnitude earthquake is at the high end of the Richter Scale. It was initially reported at 7.3 but was quickly revised up to 7.7. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages. Residents as far as Miami said they felt tremors from the powerful quake. Robert Lee, who was working on the 25th floor of the Miami Tower in Downtown Miami at the time, said he could feel the building ""swaying back and forth."" ""It was crazy! I looked up and saw a light fixture swaying and I got out,"" Lee told ABC News. He said there were easily hundreds of people outside at one point. Police in Miami said there were no injuries reported there. Andrew Jowett, a lawyer who works on Grand Cayman, said he has seen no sign of major infrastructure damage in the area, but noticed a few broken windows and cracks in surrounding buildings. He said he felt a few small aftershocks in the hours after the initial quake. “People are afraid a tsunami may be on its way,” Jowett told ABC News. “I can hear lots of sirens and there’s heavy traffic everywhere but there doesn’t seem to be anything major wrong.” He said was on the British Virgin Islands for Hurricane Irma and this is nothing remotely comparable. Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago, Cuba, said she felt the impact there. She said there was no apparent damage. “Apparently there are some cracks in the road at cricket square,” he said, and “there are sink holes around some sewers or drains.” ""We were all sitting, and we felt the chairs move,"" Guerrero told The Associated Press after the quake. ""We heard the noise of everything moving around."" ""It felt very strong, but it doesn't look like anything happened,'"" she added. A tsunami warning was issued for areas off the coasts of Belize, Cuba, Honduras, Mexico, Cayman Islands and Jamaica in the quake's wake, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. The center said those areas could experience waves as high as 3.3 feet above tidal level.

         BARSTOW (CBSLA) — A 4.6-magnitude earthquake jolted Southern California just after 7 p.m. Friday night. The quake's epicenter was 2.3 miles deep and about 14 miles north-northeast of Barstow. It was felt from San Clemente to Palmdale and even Las Vegas. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said this quake was widely felt because of its Intensity 2 rating. ""The intensity number tells you what you're feeling,"" she said. ""Intensity 2 is the type of earthquake where you have to be sitting down quietly and, 'Oh, was that an earthquake?' Where as most of the people, if you're walking around at all, you'll completely miss it."" Jones said while it looked like a wide distribution of people who felt it, it was actually a small percentage across the Southland who felt it. A 2.9-magnitude earthquake struck less than a mile away six minutes later. Jones said, like always, there's about a 5% chance that a bigger temblor will follow. I sure wish I could tell when a quake is going to be a foreshock. I spent many years looking at foreshocks to try to find something that made them different.  Never found it. We will know if it's one of the 5% that become a foreshock if something bigger happens.     ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

Please enter a valid zipcode. Save ORLANDO, Fla. â Puerto Ricans woke up Saturday morning to a new earthquake. An earthquake occurred off the southern coast of Puerto Rico, southwest of Ponce. The earthquake was originally classified as a magnitude 6.0, but U.S. Geological Service downgraded it to a 5.9. Since then, there have been several aftershocks, with one registering 5.2 in magnitude. Power outages are being reported across much of the southern part of the island. Crews are assessing power plants for damage. This is an area that's been devastated by earthquakes over the past few weeks. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake hit Puerto Rico Friday afternoon in the same general area. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Puerto Rico has experienced more than 139 earthquakes at a magnitude of 3.0 or greater.  As of Friday afternoon, USGS said six of the quakes were magnitude 5.0+.  Hundreds of thousands of people are already without water and power on the island because of the earthquakes, and thousands are staying in shelters or sleeping outside after an earthquake Tuesday destroyed homes, businesses and schools.  USGS officials say Puerto Rico is tectonically active, so infrequent large earthquakes should be expected. Before the current spate of earthquakes, within the last 50 years there had been 10 earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.0+.  The Tsunami Warning Center says there is no tsunami threat expected from the earthquake. This is a developing story. Check back for the latest developments.  Information from the Associated Press was used in this report.    "
Puerto Rico hit with another major earthquake as aftershocks continue,2020-01-11 00:49 UTC,https://thehill.com/latino/477802-puerto-rico-hit-with-another-major-earthquake-as-aftershocks-continue,"Puerto Rico was hit by yet another aftershock on Friday, with a 5.2 magnitude earthquake striking the island just days after its largest quake in decades.  The U.S. territory was struck by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake on Tuesday, as well as aftershocks, which left at least one dead and homes and crucial infrastructure destroyed. {mosads} Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency earlier this week in response to the quakes, as did several mayors of Puerto Rico’s 78 municipios. President Trump has since approved federal emergency funding for the island. It’s unclear what new damage may have been caused by the latest earthquake, but reports from earlier in the week show hundreds of homes were destroyed and a major power plant on the island was so severely damaged that two-thirds of customers, totaling millions, were left without electricity. The New York Times reported Friday that three people had died from heart attacks in addition to a man killed by a collapsed wall. The Friday quake was just one of dozens of aftershocks.

6.5-Magnitude Earthquake Strikes Puerto Rico Amid Heavy Seismic Activity,2020-01-07 03:42 UTC,https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/6-6-magnitude-earthquake-strikes-puerto-rico/2255849/,"A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck Puerto Rico before dawn on Tuesday, killing one man, injuring at least eight other people, knocking out power and collapsing buildings in the southern part of the island. The quake was followed by a series of strong aftershocks, part of a 10-day series of temblors spawned by the grinding of tectonic plates along three faults beneath southern Puerto Rico. Seismologists say it's impossible to predict when the quakes will stop or whether they will get stronger. The 6.4-magnitude quake cut power to the island as power plants shut down to protect themselves. Authorities said two plants suffered light damage and they expected power to be restored later Tuesday. Puerto Rico's main airport was operating normally, using generator power.

She said some 300,000 households remained without running water by late Tuesday afternoon, and several hundred people were in shelters in affected municipalities. She said she had not spoken to President Donald Trump by late morning. Teacher Rey González told The Associated Press that his uncle was killed when a wall collapsed on him at the home they shared in the city of Ponce. He said 73-year-old Nelson Martínez was disabled and that he and his father cared for him.  Eight people were injured in the city of Ponce, near the epicenter of the quake, Mayor Mayita Meléndez told WAPA television. Hundreds of people sat in the streets of the city, some cooking food on barbeque grills, afraid to return home for fear of structural damage and aftershocks.  Video from a Telemundo broadcast showed the moment the 5.8 aftershock hit. “We can’t predict how long this will keep going,"" John Geiger, a geophysicist with USGS, told NBC. ""There will be aftershocks. Usually, they are smaller than the main shock but that’s not always the case.” He said that statistically there is a 3 percent chance within the next week of a quake larger than the 6.4 quake that hit. The odds of a larger one go down after that, according to historic statistics from quakes.  A tsunami alert was initially issued for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but later canceled. Trump was briefed on the earthquakes in Puerto Rico in the past month, including the one on Tuesday, said Judd Deere, White House deputy press secretary. “Administration officials, including FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, have been in touch with the Governor and her team today, and we will continue to monitor the effects and coordinate with Puerto Rico officials,"" Deere said. In the historic district of Ponce, authorities evacuated more than 150 people from two buildings they said were in danger of collapsing. Among them were more than two dozen elderly patients from a nursing home who sat in their wheelchairs in silence as the earth continued to tremble. Amir Señeriz leaned against the cracked wall of his Freemason Lodge in Ponce and wailed. The roof of the 1915 building was partially collapsed and dust and debris lay around him. Outside, he had already carefully placed 10 large historic paintings. The earth continued trembling as he went back into the building to recover more artifacts. Helping him was artist Nelson Figueroa, 44, who said he slept in his street clothes. “It was chaos,” he said, adding that there was a traffic jam in his coastal neighborhood as terrified people fled. Much of the damage was reported in the southwest coastal town of Guayanilla, where the mayor said the municipality won't have power for at least two weeks. A 19th-century church in Guayanilla partially collapsed. Ruth Caravallo, 73, held on to the church’s wrought-iron gate as she cried. “My sister was the secretary here,” she said. “My husband died two months ago, and I held services for him here.” Around the corner, Father Melvin Díaz spoke to a friend on the phone and described damage to the church's icons. “The Virgin fell, Saint Judas is intact,” he said, chuckling. Díaz surveyed the collapsed church and said he was optimistic about rebuilding. “This isn't a problem, it's a challenge,"" he said. Some people rode their bicycles around the public plaza while others sought shade under lush trees that shook occasionally as the aftershocks continued. In one corner of the plaza, 74-year-old Alvin Rivera paused as he scrutinized the damage around him. “It's terribly sad,” he said. “People are panicked."" Puerto Rico's governor, Wanda Vasquez, ordered government offices closed for the day and urged citizens to remain calm and not check damage to their homes until daylight.

In the last 10 days, there have been four earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater centered nearby. Marissa, who lives in Hopland, took to social media with her experience. ""I'm on the opposite side of the highway in Hopland and it was felt. Not as long as the Napa quake in 2014. Way more shaking back then so hopefully not much damage."" Vincent Poturica, who lives in Ukiah, also felt the quake. ""Yeah, I was close to the epicenter in Ukiah,"" he posted. ""Haven't felt the earth move like that since I was a LA County kid during the Northridge quake."" ""Woke up to the house rocking back & forth, like a boat on water, & I immediately checked on my kids, who, thankfully, were fine."" There were no initial reports of damage.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

Man With Dwarfism Uses His Small Stature to Rescue Turkey's Earthquake Victims,2020-11-14 11:15 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/man-with-dwarfism-uses-his-small-stature-to-rescue-turkeys-earthquake-victims_3567923.html,"A Turkish man born with dwarfism has been helping local rescue teams save survivors of the devastating earthquake that struck the country at the beginning of the month. Ridvan Celik, 29, who is only 3 feet tall, decided that his smaller frame could be put to good use to help save lives in the worst-hit city of Izmir. The massive earthquake, measuring around 6.6 on the Richter Scale, occurred in the Aegean Sea, just off the Turkish coast. Wreaking havoc and destruction across Turkey and several Greek islands, the shocks were reported to have been felt as far away as the Greek island of Crete. The death toll in Turkey had reached 116 by Nov. 4, reported Times Now News. Buildings had collapsed and been reduced to rubble, with many people feared to be trapped underneath. At his own expense, Ridvan flew to the area to help, thinking that his diminutive size would allow him access underneath the rubble where others couldn’t get to. A national newspaper reported that he has been working around the clock for four days. “When I heard about the earthquake in Istanbul, I bought my own ticket and came to Izmir. We met our teammates here. I think about the children and parents who might be under the rubble with my memories and experiences of the 1999 earthquake,” Ridvan told Yeni Safak. Even for those who have been saved, recovery has remained an incredibly tough time. Temperatures have been dropping below 10°C (50°F), and many of the patients have been staying outdoors in tents, having to light fires in order to keep warm overnight. Ridvan, however, has remained steadfast in his determination to help. “I jumped on the task, thinking that it could be me or my loved ones under that rubble. I did not hesitate. Let’s not lose. The reaction of the people was very good. People who see the search and rescue suit on me call me your heart is big,” he added. Among the devastation and destruction, some positive stories have emerged, too. Ladbible reported that a 4-year-old girl was discovered alive and wrapped up in a blanket amidst the rubble four days after the quake shook Izmir.  “We have witnessed a miracle in the 91st hour. “Rescue teams pulled out [the] four-year-old alive. Along with the great pain we have experienced, we have this joy as well.” With dozens of people still missing, the rescue and recovery efforts continue, with many heroes like Ridvan continuing the work.

5.5 magnitude earthquake hits Nevada early Friday morning,2020-11-13 11:25 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/us/nevada-earthquake-friday/index.html,"
      A 5.5 magnitude earthquake hit Nevada in the early Friday morning hours, according to the US Geological Survey. 
   
      The quake hit a little more than 20 miles southeast of Mina and was followed by aftershocks nearby. Mina is about 160 miles southeast of Reno.
    
      Earlier this year, Nevada saw its largest earthquake in 66 years, when a 6.5 magnitude quake hit a remote area about 225 miles northwest of Las Vegas. 
   
      The powerful May earthquake was felt “in the Reno-Tahoe area, and also throughout the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys in California,” Graham Kent, director of the Nevada Seismological Laboratory, said then. 
   
      It was the first large one the state had felt since 1954, he added.

Minor Earthquake Hit Massachusetts On Sunday,2020-11-09 18:51 UTC,https://www.wshu.org/post/minor-earthquake-hit-massachusetts-sunday,"A 3.6 magnitude earthquake struck the coast of Massachusetts just after 9 a.m. on Sunday morning.   The United States Geological Survey reported the earthquake in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts. It was first registered as magnitude 4.2, and later lowered to 3.6. Residents across Massachusetts and Connecticut could feel the impact. Long Island residents also reported feeling the earthquake, with most of the reports coming from northern Suffolk County. University of Connecticut researchers say this is the largest seismic event in New England since 2012."
"Earthquake is felt in Massachusetts, Rhode Island on Sunday morning",2020-11-08 14:40 UTC,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/11/08/nation/earthquake-is-felt-massachusetts-rhode-island-sunday-morning/,"Nine families in New Bedford were displaced by an earthquake that shook southern New England Sunday morning and left three buildings in the city uninhabitable, according to the Red Cross of Massachusetts.  In New Bedford, a total of 22 people were left homeless by the earthquake and are staying in hotels, said Jeff Hall, a Red Cross spokesman. Advertisement No injuries were reported. The quake damaged the natural gas line to one building and left the others with structural damage, Hall said. New Bedford city inspectors are expected to determine whether the buildings can be saved. New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell, in a series of Twitter posts Sunday, asked residents to check their chimneys for damage, particularly in basements, and contact the fire department if they find a problem. Chimneys in at least two houses appeared to have been cracked by the earthquake. Anyone who smells gas should evacuate and then call 911, he said. Damage to chimneys could interfere with a boiler or burner, and lead to a gas or carbon monoxide leak. “It’s going to get cold sooner or later, and people will start [turning] on their heating systems,” Mitchell said in a video. “We want to make sure they are working, and not damaged.” In Dartmouth, which lies near the epicenter, police Detective Kyle Costa said no damage had been reported. Representatives for National Grid and Eversource reported no service interruptions or damage from the quake. Christopher Besse, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said officials had been monitoring the situation following the quake and were ""in contact with local emergency management directors to coordinate state assistance if necessary,” he said. Advertisement Beyond New Bedford, there were few signs of major damage. In Cotuit, Kevin Nichols said he could feel his home shake during the earthquake. “It was not a pleasant experience,” he said. US Representative William Keating, in an interview with WCVB-TV, described what he experienced during the earthquake. “All of a sudden, the house shook,” Keating said. “The only way I could describe it was, it was just like, you know, an explosion without the sound.” Dr. John E. Ebel, a Boston College professor of geophysics and a senior research scientist at Weston Observatory, said earthquakes similar to Sunday’s happen about once a year in New England. Ebel said there is a better than 50 percent chance that people living  on the South Shore will experience an aftershock from Sunday’s quake.  There is also a small possibility, he said, that a more powerful earthquake may occur at some point, though the chances of that  happening are probably no more than 5 percent. But more damaging quakes have occurred in the area.  In 1755, a roughly magnitude 6 earthquake struck off Cape Ann. Roads were blocked by piles of brick from fallen chimneys, he said, and the tower at Faneuil Hall had to be repaired. Ebel said people living in the region should be aware of the potential impact of earthquake  and noted that building codes here have incorporated standards to help structures resist seismic forces. Advertisement “There is a chance for a damaging earthquake centered in the region,” Ebel said. It’s impossible to predict when one will occur, but “there is every reason to believe there will be one in the future.” On Sunday, there was a sense of disbelief as people took to social media to make sure that, yes, they just experienced an earthquake in New England. Did RI just have a tremor or was there an earthquake in the region? Our whole house just shook for 5-10 seconds. My social media friends chimes in from Boston, Worchester and as far as CT that they felt it too. I’m seeing a lot of tweets about an earthquake in RI and MA. Felt it here on North Shore of Long Island, NY. Lasted maybe 3 seconds tops. Bed frame and adjacent furniture started shaking. David Goldstein, 62, of South Dennis, said he’s never experienced anything like the quake, which he said shook his house. He described it as sounding like a very loud truck rumbling past his home. He and his wife realized what had occurred when they read a Boston Globe report online, he said in a phone interview. He said he thought about reversing a recent decision on his insurance. “The first thing I thought of was to reinstate the earthquake insurance I just canceled,” Goldstein said, who joked that his decision led to the quake. “This is probably why we had one. You didn’t know I had such power,” he said. Nichols, 47, said he was reading the New Yorker when his home shook Sunday morning. The sound, he said, was like that of a sonic boom and lasted for several seconds. His first impression was that his partner was running the washing machine — but immediately reconsidered. “I quickly realized that wasn’t possible, because the whole house was shaking,” Nichols said.

Deadly Aegean Earthquake And Tsunami Hit Greece And Turkey,2020-10-30 15:49 UTC,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2020/10/30/deadly-70-earthquake-rattles-greece-and-turkey/,"This picture shows destroyed car and collapsed buildings after an earthquake in the island of Samos ... [+] on October 30, 2020. - A powerful earthquake hit Greece and Turkey on October 30, 2020, causing buildings to collapse and a sea surge that flooded streets in the Turkish resort city of Izmir. Greek public television said the quake also caused a mini-tsunami on the eastern Aegean Sea island of Samos, damaging buildings. The US Geological Survey said the 7.0 magnitude quake was registered 14 kilometres (8.6 miles) off the Greek town of Karlovasi on Samos. (Photo by STR / Eurokinissi / AFP) (Photo by STR/Eurokinissi/AFP via Getty Images) The US Geological Survey reports a magnitude 7.0 earthquake has struck in the Aegean Sea, just off the coast of both Turkey and the Greek island of Samos. Turkish authorities report that at least six people have been killed near the coastal city of Izmir, where multiple buildings have collapsed. Greek news outlets report that at least eight people have been injured on Samos where numerous buildings have also been damaged.  About three-and-a-half hours after the first quake, the strongest aftershock so far registered a 5.2 on the Richter scale. Turkey’s Health Disaster Coordination Center says one of the people killed died from drowning as the tremors have sent a small tsunami surge of water onto streets. Footage shared to social media shows chaos amidst the rubble and later scenes of flood waters rushing past shops.  So far, 257 people have been reported injured in Izmir, and 12 buildings damaged or destroyed. The city is one of Turkey’s largest, with a population of over four million. The earthquake’s relatively shallow depth of about 10 miles would have made it felt particularly strongly near the epicenter. The leaders of both countries have said that government resources are being mobilized to the affected areas to offer help and shelter. Developing story... "

Strong Aegean Sea earthquake topples buildings in Turkey,2020-10-30 12:52 UTC,https://www.kfyrtv.com/2020/10/30/66-magnitude-earthquake-in-aegean-sea-shakes-western-turkey/,"ISTANBUL (AP) — A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 19 people and injuring over 700 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 17 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, including one who drowned, and 709 were injured, according to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Among the dead were the wife and two children of the secretary-general of the Turkish Medical Association’s Izmir branch, the group said. On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying “Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children.” At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall and cranes lifted concrete slabs from the wreckage.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul’s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey’s largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter — roughly 10 kilometers — potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 3,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens. France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France’s “full solidarity with Greece and Turkey” and said “we are ready to offer the necessary aid.” The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. Some islanders planned to spend the night in emergency tents for fear of aftershocks. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. “We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,” Turkey’s Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. “This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We’re ready to help if Greece needs it.” Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, tweeted that he had phoned Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together.” Erdogan responded to the tweet with his thanks and offered his condolences. “Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,” he wrote. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and NATO allies. —- Becatoros reported from Athens.

Residents took to social media to express their shock at the rare occurrence. Hundreds of people as far away as Philadelphia and Long Island, New York, contributed to the USGS' “Did You Feel It?” map, reporting only weak or light shaking and no damage. “It would be very surprising for us to see anything more than you know, damaged shelves or picture frames falling off of windows,” said Robert Sanders, a geophysicist with the survey.  The USGS said the earthquake happened about 2 a.m. and was centered 1.25 miles (2 kilometers) south, southeast of the center of East Freehold, about 3 miles deep. “That’s a fairly uncommon event magnitude for quakes in this area,” Sanders said. Since 1970, there have been two other quakes within 10 miles of this location, a 3.5 in 1979 and a 3.1 in 1992, he said. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved."

Preliminary magnitude 7.8 earthquake strikes off coast of Alaska,2020-07-22 14:16 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/22/us/alaska-7-8-magnitude-earthquake/index.html,"
      An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck off southern Alaska’s coast late Tuesday, shaking the Alaska Peninsula and briefly sparking tsunami concerns before officials said no destructive waves were coming.
   
      The earthquake was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles southeast of Perryville on the sparsely populated Alaska Peninsula, striking around 10:12 p.m. local time (2:12 a.m. Wednesday ET).
   
      The Alaska Peninsula protrudes from mainland Alaska and is flanked to the southwest by the Aleutian Islands. 
    
      The warning sent people to higher ground in cities like Sand Point, an island community of about 1,000 people off the peninsula, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
   
      People in Sand Point gathered at a high school until shortly after midnight, when officials gave an all-clear, Jordan Keeler, an Anchorage-based city administrator, told the newspaper.
   
      “The first wave didn’t materialize, which is a great thing,” Keeler, who was in contact with staff in Sand Point, told the Anchorage Daily News. No reports of major structural damage were made on the island, Keeler told the newspaper.
   
      “We’ve canceled the (tsunami) advisories because it doesn’t look like it’s becoming a large wave or any larger,” National Tsunami Warning Center Director James Gridley said, according to CNN affiliate KTUU.
   
      Strong shaking was reported on the peninsula, the USGS said. Light to weak shaking was reported around Kodiak, about 300 miles northeast of the quake’s center, and in Anchorage, some 530 miles from the center, according to the USGS.
   
      In Kodiak, a city of about 6,000 people, a long line of cars headed up a mountain after residents learned of the tsunami warning late Tuesday, John Cannon told KTUU.
   
      Police were “trying to clear the lower areas down by the harbor,” he said.
   
      “You (could) hear the tsunami alarms. It’s rather eerie,” he told KTUU.
   
      This quake’s depth was 28 kilometers, or 17 miles, the USGS said – relatively shallow.
   
      “Anything below 70 kilometers is considered a shallow quake,” CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. “That’s important, because shallow earthquakes often cause the most damage, compared to the ones that are deeper, regardless of the strength.”
   
      More than 20 aftershocks followed the quake late Tuesday to early Wednesday, ranging from magnitudes of 2.8 to 6.1.

"Powerful Earthquake Shakes Southern, Central Mexico",2020-06-24 06:07 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/powerful-earthquake-shakes-southern-central-mexico_3399107.html,"MEXICO CITY—A powerful earthquake centered near the southern Mexico resort of Huatulco killed at least one person, swayed buildings in Mexico City, and sent thousands fleeing into the streets. Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed and another injured in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise, he said reports were of minor damage such as broken windows and collapsed walls. Ports, airports, and refineries weren’t damaged, he said in a video-recorded phone conversation with his civil defense chief. There had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out in some areas. Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.  It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico. In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small, protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued. “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitudes 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves 3 to 10 feet above tide levels along with parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru, and Ecuador. Guatemala’s national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea.

7.4 mag earthquake felt off coast of Mexico,2020-06-23 17:59 UTC,https://thehill.com/policy/international/americas/504113-74-mag-earthquake-felt-off-coast-of-mexico,"A 7.4 magnitude earthquake was felt off the southern coast of Mexico in the state of Oaxaca, prompting a forecast of potential tsunami waves, the country’s National Seismological Service reported Tuesday afternoon.  The USGS estimates the earthquake itself could result in as many as 100 fatalities and $100 million in damage.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a tsunami warning for the coast of Mexico, with waves of up to 3 meters. The warning also reaches Ecuador, where there could be waves of between 0.3 and 1 meter in height. The Oaxaca governor, Alejandro Murat, has reported that at least one person is dead as a result of the earthquake and another is injured. In Mexico City, its seismic alert system was activated and hundreds of people took to the streets at the emergency notice. Videos on social media show buildings shaking in the capitol city. In 2017, two powerful earthquakes — one that had a magnitude of 7.1 and the other a magnitude of 8.1 — hit the country in two weeks, toppling buildings, cracking highways and killing hundreds of people.  Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

         SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF/AP) -- A major earthquake measuring 7.4 in magnitude struck along Mexico's west coast off the state of Oaxaca Tuesday, triggering a tsunami warning stretching from Acapulco to the coast of El Salvador and killing at least five people, according to authorities. Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat said there were rescue crews trying to get to a remote mountain village were some 15 people were reported trapped under rubble.  There was no threat posed to the California coastline.  The temblor struck on a relatively unpopulated area of the Mexican west coast located off the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The nearest village was Santa Maria Zapotitlán located 7 miles away. But social media was filled with images of toppled store shelved and quake damage in Oaxaca.

 The U.S. Geological Service is reporting that a magnitude-6.4 earthquake struck in remote western Nevada early Friday.  The initial quake struck about 4.7 miles (7.6 kilometers) deep, the USGS said, and at least six sizable aftershocks were recorded shortly thereafter, including two with estimated magnitudes of 5.4. People from Salt Lake City, Utah, to California's Central Valley tweeted that they felt the quake.

No injuries were reported, but officials said goods tumbled from market shelves, sidewalks heaved and storefront windows cracked shortly after 4 a.m. People from Salt Lake City to California’s Central Valley tweeted that they felt shaking. Lights swayed at the governor’s mansion in Carson City, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak told reporters. “It woke me up, so it definitely had an impact,” he said.  Nevada Highway Patrol photos showed cracks on U.S. 95 before crews repaired them about 35 miles (56 kilometers) west of Tonopah. A detour to State Route 360 had added more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) to motorists' trips. The vast open range east of the snow-capped Sierra Nevada is seismically active, said Graham Kent, director of the Nevada Seismological Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno. He ranked Friday's event with twin December 1954 earthquakes at Fairview Peak and Dixie Valley. Kent said those temblors were magnitudes 7.1 and 6.8, respectively. The U.S. Geological Survey reported Friday's temblor struck just east of the Sierra Nevada. It was initially reported at 6.4-magnitude. It was centered about 4.7 miles (7.6 kilometers) deep, the agency said, and dozens of aftershocks were recorded. Kent said a 5.1 magnitude aftershock struck about 30 minutes after the initial quake. State troopers and sheriff's patrols from Esmeralda and surrounding Mineral and Nye counties checked highways for possible damage. A sheriff's dispatcher in the historic mining boom town of Goldfield said the 112-year-old Esmeralda County Courthouse escaped damage. Nye County sheriff's Capt. David Boruchowitz reported no damage at the Mizpah Hotel and Clown Motel, two landmark businesses in Tonopah, a mining hub about halfway between Las Vegas and Reno. Keith Hasty, a Tonopah gas station employee, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that groceries were shaken off shelves and that residents said their televisions shook. Nye County spokesman Arnold Knightly reported broken storefront glass, stress cracks on asphalt streets, loose hanging signs, items knocked off shelves and minor lifting of sidewalks. “Overall, everything appears to be sound at this point,"" Knightly said. “”However, we have learned that other than obvious earthquake damage some damage is discovered later."" Last July, a 56-year-old backyard mechanic was found dead in Pahrump four days after strong quakes struck near Ridgecrest, California, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) away. Investigators said it appeared a Jeep he was repairing wobbled off its support jacks. State seismic network manager Ken Smith noted that Friday’s earthquake happened a few miles east of the site of a magnitude 6.2 temblor in July 1986 in California’s Chalfant Valley.  Larger earthquakes in the region in the last century included a 6.5-magnitude temblor in 1934 and a magnitude 6.8 quake in 1932, the state seismology lab said. A 6-magnitude earthquake in February 2008 damaged hundreds of structures in the northeast Nevada town of Wells, including its historic El Rancho Hotel and Casino. Officials recently announced plans to restore the hotel. ___ This story has been corrected to reference U.S. Geological Survey, not Service. ____ Associated Press writer Paul Davenport in Phoenix contributed to this report.

The tremor hit at a depth of around 60 miles, the agency said. The quake appears to have struck between Indonesia’s Maluku and Timor Leste. The AFP news agency reported that no tsunami alert was issued following the tremor. Residents in the area said they were awoken by shaking beds and buildings, and they were forced to flee. “People were asleep, we screamed. People ran because of the quake, beds shook,” resident Oce Karmomyana was quoted by the Daily Mail as saying. The Richter seismic scale usually classifies a 6.8 magnitude temblor as “a strong earthquake,” according to the USGS. “Because of the logarithmic basis of the scale, each whole-number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in measured amplitude; as an estimate of energy, each whole number step in the magnitude scale corresponds to the release of about 31 times more energy than the amount associated with the preceding whole number value,” the agency’s website says. Indonesia and other Pacific island nations are located on the Ring of Fire, which is an especially earthquake-prone region that encircles the Pacific Ocean. Other than earthquakes and tsunamis, the region also experiences a number of volcanic eruptions. One of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in recorded history occurred off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia in 2004, killing at least 200,000 people, according to the USGS. In 2018, a tsunami hit the city of Palu on Indonesia’s Sulawesi, killing thousands of people. Share this with everyone!"

Salt Lake City Area hit by 5.7 magnitude earthquake,2020-03-18 14:28 UTC,https://fox59.com/news/salt-lake-city-area-hit-by-5-7-magnitude-earthquake/,"Fox 59 Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A 5.7-magnitude earthquake shook Salt Lake City and its suburbs early Wednesday, sending spooked residents fleeing their homes, knocking out power for tens of thousands and closing the city’s airport. The epicenter was just southwest of Salt Lake City, between the city’s airport and the Great Salt Lake. The temblor and its aftershocks physically and mentally rattled approximately 2.8 million people who are already hunkered down amid the coronavirus epidemic. There were no initial reports of injuries, said Utah Emergency Management spokesman Joe Dougherty. Operations at Salt Lake City International Airport came to a halt and the control tower and concourses were evacuated. Planes headed to Salt Lake City were diverted while officials conducted a runway inspection. Police blocked the road to the airport, allowing in only those who were picking up passengers. No runway damage was found and most of the damage in the terminal appears caused by a broken water line, said the airport’s executive director, Bill Wyatt. He said he expected the airport to reopen in “hours not days.” The quake also shut down the light rail service for Salt Lake City and its suburbs. Residents reported feeling shaking across a 100-mile (160 kilometer) area, with the heaviest impact in Salt Lake County, officials said. Some residents ran from their homes and into the streets as they felt the earthquake shake buildings for 10 to 15 seconds. There were some reports of damage, but authorities did not expect it to be severe. The quake sent bricks showering from a homeless onto the sidewalk below. In downtown Salt Lake City, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ iconic Salt Lake Temple sustained minor damage, with the trumpet falling from the Angel Moroni statue at the top of the temple and stones displaced from a spire. The temple is undergoing renovations and a seismic upgrade. Construction crews have been sent home while the damage is being assessed, church spokesman Daniel Woodruff said in a statement. Gov. Gary Herbert warned people to stay away from downtown Salt Lake City while officials assess damage. But authorities did not expect to find severe damage in most structures, said Doughtery, the emergency management spokesman. “We’re hearing of lights falling down, bookcases falling down, we’ve heard of water lines breaking inside of buildings,” Dougherty said. People reported feeling the quake in the neighboring states of Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming and Nevada. About 73,000 homes and businesses lost electricity in the Salt Lake City area, but power was quickly being restored in some areas, said utility Rocky Mountain Power. It was the largest earthquake to hit Utah since a 5.9 magnitude quake shook southern Utah in 1992, according to Utah Emergency Management. Most shaking was reported in the Salt Lake County area, near the epicenter in the Salt Lake City suburb of Magna but the quake was felt 80 miles away (130 kilometers) in the Utah city of Logan.  Dougherty recommended that people check on their neighbors, but that advice that could be challenging when people are being told to say inside their homes to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “This is the time for people to really do the right thing, make sure everyone is taken care of,” Dougherty said. “But we still do need to remember we have a pandemic going on at the same time.”

         LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — A building that has sat empty since the Northridge earthquake is rising from the ashes of that disaster 26 years later as a shiny beacon of much-needed residential development. The Panorama Tower, which was heavily damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, reopened Thursday as a 14-story apartment building. It was originally designed as a 13-story office building in 1962. The building, at the corner of Van Nuys Boulevard and Titus Street, was purchased by the Shomof Group in 2015, according to Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez. The real estate developer added two penthouse spaces to the roof, and made $25 million in renovations, green building and seismic retrofitting upgrades. The building now is now 189,000 square feet and has 194 residential units. The newly renovated building is the latest development to rise up in the Panorama City area, which suffered a one-two punch of losing manufacturing jobs in the 80s and 90s, then the devastation from the Northridge earthquake, according to Martinez. Two more affordable and supportive housing projects are being planned nearby, and Metro will break ground in 2022 on a new light rail line that will pass right in front of the Panorama Tower on Van Nuys Boulevard. The area is also becoming a walkable haven, with ""The Plant"" shopping center a few blocks down on Van Nuys Boulevard at the site of what was once a General Motors plant, and a former Carnation Plant site reopening as Panorama High School.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Several high-rise buildings in Miami were evacuated after a powerful earthquake hit the Caribbean,2020-01-29 05:16 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/28/us/miami-earthquake-evacuations-jamaica/index.html,"
      Hundreds of people were evacuated from high-rise buildings near downtown Miami after a powerful earthquake in the Caribbean Sea on Tuesday. 
   
      Several buildings in Miami were shaking Tuesday but no injuries or structural damage has been reported, Miami police and fire officials tweeted.
    
      Jose Borrego was in a work meeting at the Bank of America building in the Brickell neighborhood when he “felt slight movement of the building.” When he came outside, he said he noticed every building in the area was being evacuated.
   
      “The evacuation was pretty smooth, but all in all anxious about the state of emergency and the lack of information regarding the situation,” said Borrego, an employee of software company Kaseya.
   
      At least eight buildings in the area decided to evacuate following the earthquake, Miami City Commissioner Ken Russell told CNN affiliate WPLG.
   
      The Stephen P. Clark Government Center was closed as a precaution, Miami-Dade county officials said. 
   
      Jose Abreu, an employee at another high-rise, said he felt the walls vibrating for about 90 seconds but thought it was a malfunctioning fan.
   
      “I thought it was the fan acting up on me. I didn’t think anything of it,” he said. “I just went along, until the building announcement came through the speakers and I just evacuated in the back of the building.”
   
      Others in Miami’s financial district told CNN they didn’t feel shaking but were concerned about retrieving items from their offices.

It was felt by some locals in the Las Vegas Valley. “The Barstow area is in a geologically active area like we are and like Ridgecrest. So it shouldn’t be too surprising to have decent magnitude quakes throughout the Mojave,” seismologist Jose Bunde said. “I haven’t seen where the epicenter has been calculated, but there are faults like the ones in our valley called dip slip faults and there are faults like the San Andreas called strike- slip faults in that area. I won’t be surprised if there are a series of aftershocks, some in the 4’s for the next couple weeks.”  You can help out the United States Geological survey by filling out a “Felt Report.” You can find the link in the tweet below.

Please enter a search term.       ANKARA, Turkey (AP) – A 6.8-magnitude earthquake rocked a sparsely-populated part of eastern Turkey on Friday, killing at least 18 people, injuring more than 500 and leaving some 30 trapped in the wreckage of toppled buildings, Turkish officials said. Rescue teams from neighboring provinces were dispatched to the affected areas, working in the dark with floodlights  in the freezing cold, and Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said troops were on standby to help. Hundreds of residents were left homeless or with damaged homes. TV footage showed rescuers pull out one injured person from the rubble of a collapsed building in the district of Gezin, in the eastern Elazig province. Around 30 were believed to be trapped inside collapsed structures in Elazig province, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca, who traveled to the afflicted area together with Soylu, said 13 people were killed in Elazig, including two people who suffered heart attacks, and five others died in Malatya. A total of 553 people were hurt, including 11 who were in serious condition. Some 30 buildings had collapsed from the quake in the two provinces, according to Murat Kurum, the environment minister. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Twitter that all measures were being taken to “ensure that the earthquake that occurred in Elazig and was felt in many provinces is overcome with the least amount of loss.”   Elazig is some 750 kilometers (465 miles) east of the capital, Ankara. People in Elazig whose homes were damaged or were too afraid to go indoors were being moved to student dormitories or sports center amid freezing conditions. Elazig Governor Cetin Oktay Kaldirim told NTV television that a fire broke out in a building in Sivrice, near the epicenter, but was quickly brought under control. Interior Minister Soylu was at a meeting on earthquake preparedness when the quake struck.  The Kandilli seismology center in Istanbul said the quake measured 6.5., while the U.S. Geological Survey gave the preliminary magnitude as 6.7, and said the quake affected not only Turkey but also Syria, Georgia and Armenia. Different earthquake monitoring centers frequently give differing estimates. NTV said the earthquake was felt in several Turkish provinces and sent people running outdoors in panic. Turkey sits on top of two major fault-lines and earthquakes are frequent. Two strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey in 1999, killing around 18,000 people.  A magnitude 6 earthquake killed 51 people in Elazig in 2010. Stay with 8News for updates to this developing story.   Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

         BALTIMORE (WJZ) -- Puerto Rico continues to struggle after being hit by the strongest earthquake in more than a century, and as residents continue to deal with strong aftershocks and a lack of water and electricity, a group of volunteers from the Baltimore area are heading south to help aid the region's recovery. Members of Breath of God Lutheran Church in Baltimore's Highlandtown neighborhood have been traveling to the island for the past three summers to help residents rebuild after hurricanes Irma and Maria. Now, they're planning another trip as nearly one-third of residents in the American territory remain in the dark in the wake of the deadly 6.4-magnitude quake. Pastor Mark Parker said while their work might be more extensive this time around, their commitment to the people of Puerto Rico remains the same. ""The sense of despair and hopelessness that that brings after having rebuilt is a familiar refrain from those friends,"" said Bishop William Gohl. The church is now recruiting close to 200 volunteers to join in its efforts this coming summer. ""Whether it be rebuilding some of the things we had done or put into place before or something completely different,"" volunteer Victoria Broderick said. The mission is intended to help re-establish and strengthen homes, businesses and places of worship. ""You see signs of that resilience that you've built into the physical infrastructure,"" Parker said. To sign up to volunteer or make a donation, click here.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

They have been the largest in a series of quakes that have struck the U.S. territory in recent days and caused heavy damage in some areas. Puerto Ricans sleep in the streets, on mountaintops and in tents now because anywhere feels safer than their homes. Some still stand, others were destroyed by recent quakes. Ponce Laspina, director of El Maestro Inc. in New York's South Bronx, speaks of his family in Ponce, an area hit especially hard. ""Like most of the island, they're afraid, they are scared,"" he said. Laspina is coordinating the collection of goods to ship to the island. ""We make sure it gets to the right people in Puerto Rico."" Dr. Luis Rodriguez,  CEO of the non-profit Puerto Rican Family Institute, is also calling on the community to help.

A tsunami alert was issued for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after the initial quake, but was later canceled. Albert Rodríguez, who is from the southwest town of Guánica, said the tsunami sirens went off before officials canceled the alert. He said there is widespread damage in his neighborhood. “The road is cracked in the middle and it lifted up,” he said. The mayor of Guayanilla, Nelson Torres, told NotiUno radio station that the church in the public plaza of his town collapsed. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, told The Associated Press that it is hard to obtain reports of damage or injuries because communications are down for much of the island. He said officials in Ponce told him there was widespread damage. “We expect that this will be the largest quake for now,” he said. “The aftershocks will continue for some time.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Wanda Vasquez, told station Radioisla just before 6 a.m. that there had been no immediate reports of deaths. She ordered government offices closed for the day and urged citizens to remain calm and not check damage to their homes until daylight. A 5.8-magnitude quake that struck early Monday morning collapsed five homes in the southwest coastal town of Guánica and heavily damaged dozens of others. It also caused small landslides and power outages. The quake was followed by a string of smaller temblors. The shake collapsed a coastal rock formation that had formed a sort of rounded window, Punta Ventana, that was a popular tourist draw in the southwest town of Guayanilla. Residents in the south of the island have been terrified to go into their homes for fear that another quake will bring buildings down.  He said the quakes overall come as the North American plate and the Caribbean plate squeeze Puerto Rico. One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a magnitude 7.3 quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.

Puerto Rico hit with a magnitude-5.8 earthquake,2020-01-06 19:22 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/06/us/puerto-rico-earthquake/index.html,"
      A damaging earthquake struck Puerto Rico early Monday, with plenty of aftershocks expected. 
   
      The magnitude 5.8 tremor happened at 5:32 a.m. ET, the US Geological Survey said.  
   
      It was centered about 8 miles south-southeast of Indios, Puerto Rico, at a depth of about 3.7 miles below ground.
   
      No major injuries were reported, Puerto Rico Director of Emergency Management Carlos Acevedo said. 
   
      He said some homes were damaged in Guanica, and a home collapsed in Guayanilla. 
   
      Some victims of the earthquake posted photos of deep cracks in walls.

      There were also reports of rock slides along Route 2, Acevedo said. 
   A causa del temblor... carrera #2 Ponce 
No tsunami warning was issued after the quake. But geologists warn of more tremors to come. 
    
      “More earthquakes than usual (called aftershocks) will continue to occur near the mainshock,” the USGS said. 
   
      “When there are more earthquakes, the chance of a large earthquake is greater which means that the chance of damage is greater.”
   
      The agency advised anyone in or near vulnerable structures to be extra cautious and said those caught in potential quakes should drop, cover and hold on.

Please enter a search term.     Croatia (AP) (12/28/20)— A moderate earthquake hit central Croatia near its capital of Zagreb early Monday, triggering panic and damaging some buildings in towns south of the city. There were no immediate reports of injuries.  The mayor of Petrinja, Darinko Dumbovic, told state HRT television that “we have bricks and tiles in the streets and fallen chimneys.” The quake was also felt in Zagreb, waking up people and sending them fleeing into the streets. Security cameras showed parked cars shaking for several seconds, triggering their alarms. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic promised state help in repairing the damage while he toured the quake-hit regions on Monday. “This year is ending the way it started,” Plenkovic said, referring to two earlier earthquakes in Croatia that came on top of the coronavirus outbreak that is challenging the nation. The quake Monday was also felt in neighboring Bosnia. Earlier this year, the Zagreb area was hit by a strong quake on March 22, causing substantial damage. One person died and at least 27 were injured. Monday’s quake appeared to be lighter. Stay up to date with the latest news by downloading the KTVE/KARD News App from the App Store or Google Play.

         A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck off the Alaska Peninsula on Monday afternoon, triggering a tsunami warning in the region. The warning was downgraded to an advisory within a few hours, and then was lifted entirely later Monday after waves about 2 feet high rolled onto the shore in some areas.  Some schools on the peninsula were evacuated earlier in the day, but there were no reports of damage.  Emergency sirens were activated in Alaska and the Kodiak Emergency Operations Center monitored the situation, CBS affiliate KTVA-TV reported. Police in the city of Homer urged residents in low elevation areas to move to higher ground while the alert was in place. David Adams, a co-manager of a bed and breakfast in Sand Point, told The Associated Press that the quake ""was a pretty good shaker here"" and said ""the structure itself is sound."" He also said that all guests were accounted for. ""It just kind of happened all of a sudden,"" he added. A Cold Bay, Alaska, resident shared video from her living room as she and her three children huddled under a table when the quake rattled their home, KTVA-TV said. ""We are getting very accustomed to these earthquakes, and I've learned to just accept that this is what we have to endure when we decide to live between volcanoes and an active plate, the ring of fire,"" Candace Nielsen told the station. The tsunami warning has been downgraded to a tsunami advisory, but aftershocks keep hitting communities near Sand Point... The National Weather Service in Los Angeles and San Diego said there was no tsunami threat to the West Coast. An advisory was put in place Monday afternoon for the Hawaiian islands, but again there were no reports of large waves or any damage.

Tsunami warning issued after 7.5 earthquake off Alaska's Aleutian Islands,2020-10-19 21:36 UTC,https://myfox8.com/news/tsunami-warning-issued-after-7-5-earthquake-off-alaskas-aleutian-islands/,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       SAND POINT, Alaska (NewsNation Now) — A magnitude 7.5 earthquake prompted a tsunami warning Monday for a nearly thousand-mile stretch of Alaska’s southern coast, with waves over 2 feet at the nearest community as the threat subsided. The National Tsunami Warning Center issued the warning for South Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, Pacific coasts from Kennedy Entrance, Alaska to Unimak Pass, Alaska, including Sand Point, Cold Bay and Kodiak, which are sparsely populated. The quake was centered near Sand Point, a city of about 900 people off the Alaska Peninsula where wave levels late Monday topped 2 feet according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. The warning was downgraded to an advisory just over two hours after the quake hit. It was lifted later Monday night. “It was a pretty good shaker here,” said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. “You could see the water kind of shaking and shimmering during the quake. Our truck was swaying big time.” Raynelle Gardner, a secretary at Sand Point School in the Aleutians East Borough School District, said things were hectic because “this is an evacuation point.” Some schools in the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District were evacuated to higher ground, the district said on Twitter. Public safety officials in King Cove sent out an alert urging residents in the coastal area to move inland to higher ground. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center tweeted that a tsunami with a height of 2 feet was observed at Sand Point, Alaska. The size of the quake was originally reported as a magnitude of 7.4, but was revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said an earthquake of this size, in this area, is not a surprise. “This is an area where the Pacific Plate is subducting underneath the North American Plate. And because of that, the Pacific Plate actually goes underneath the North American Plate, where it melts,” Caruso said, noting that’s why there are volcanoes in the region. “And so we commonly have large, magnitude 7 earthquakes in that area.” If you are in a tsunami warning area, you should evacuate inland or to higher ground above and beyond designated tsunami hazard zones or move to an upper floor of a multi-story building based on your situation.  The Alaska Earthquake Center said the quake was widely felt in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula. The Alaska Earthquake Center said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. Later on Monday night, a Tsunami Advisory was issued for the State of Hawaii, but there wasn’t expected to be a major Tsunami.   Read more information from tsunami.gov.

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.5 rattled Southern California Friday night, hitting near South El Monte with shaking felt in a wide swath of the region.  Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones told Eyewitness News the quake was similar in type and location to the deadly 1987 Whittier-Narrows quake which had a magnitude of 5.9. But this one was much smaller in power. ""Here in Pasadena I felt it,"" Jones said. ""It woke me up."" She added that there were at least two aftershocks, measuring 2.1 and 1.6. She also said there is a 5% chance that it was a foreshock to a larger quake.  There is also about a 50% chance of additional small aftershocks within the next 24 hours, she said. The earthquake was initially estimated at 4.8, then downgraded to 4.6 and then to 4.5. A shake map produced by the USGS indicates the rattling was felt south to San Diego, north to Santa Barbara and east well out into the Inland Empire and the Mojave Desert, as well as off the coast on Catalina and Santa Cruz islands.   There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, but local police and fire departments said they were on alert and surveying their communities for damage.

Residents took to social media to express their shock at the rare occurrence. Hundreds of people as far away as Philadelphia and Long Island, New York, contributed to the USGS “did you feel it?” map, reporting only weak or light shaking and no damage. “It would be very surprising for us to see anything more than you know, damaged shelves or picture frames falling off of windows,” said Robert Sanders, a geophysicist with the survey. The USGS said the earthquake happened about 2 a.m. and was centered 1.25 miles (2 kilometers) south, southeast of the center of East Freehold, about 3 miles deep. Advertisement “That’s a fairly uncommon event magnitude for quakes in this area,” Sanders said. Since 1970, there have been two other quakes within 10 miles of this location, a 3.5 in 1979 and a 3.1 in 1992, he said.

Beirut Port Explosion Triggers Magnitude 3 Earthquake,2020-08-06 04:00 UTC,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbressan/2020/08/06/beirut-port-explosion-triggers-magnitude-3-earthquake/,"Seismograms showing seismic waves arriving at various stations of the regional network of the ... [+] Geological Survey of Israel, diagram shared by @NadavWetzler. A massive explosion in the city of Beirut, Lebanon, killed more than 100 people and flattened nearby buildings, sending shock waves more than 250 kilometers (150 miles) across the ground. Eyewitness accounts describe widespread shacking of buildings in a radius of 50 kilometers, and trembling of the ground felt still 250 kilometers away from the explosion center. The seismic waves were recorded by the seismographic network of the Geological Survey of Israel and seismic stations along the Syrian border to Turkey, almost 400 kilometers away. According to first estimates by geologists, the blast was equivalent to a magnitude 4.5 earthquake, comparable to the energy released by the detonation of 1.000 to 3.000 tons of TNT. The USGS gives a lower magnitude of 3.3. The reported magnitude is not directly comparable to an earthquake of similar size because the explosion occurred at the surface where seismic waves are not as efficiently generated. News reports state the explosion was caused by the deflagration of 2.750 tons of ammonium nitrate stocked in the port district of Beirut, which is roughly equivalent to 1.100 tons of TNT. A diagram shared by Jugurtha Kariche, a geologist at the Institute de Physique du Globe in Strasbourg, France, shows the typical seismogram caused by an explosion. Seismic signal recorded by the University of Naplouse (Palestinian territories). The seismogram is ... [+] situated at ~188 km S of Beirut. A first body wave magnitude estimation give also a magnitude Mb~4. For comparison this is equivalent in term of energy to 1000 t of TNT. An earthquake is caused by the sliding of rocks along a fracture, resulting in seismic waves with a complex seismogram. The seismic sensor will first detect the Primary (P- or compressional waves) and then Secondary (S- or Transverse) Waves, followed by the more destructive surface or Rayleigh Waves. An explosion generates a sphere of fast-traveling compressional waves, spreading in all directions at the same speed, resulting in a more simple pattern. During a blast, a sudden peak of P-Waves is followed by a tail of weaker interference and surface waves, without a recognizable S-Waves peak. "

An initial report, later revised, said the magnitude of the quake was 6.3. There were no immediate reports of any injuries. The Philippines’ volcanology agency said it was expecting damage and aftershocks, but there was no tsunami threat due to the nature of the tectonic, nearshore quake. “No destructive tsunami threat exists based on available data,” the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology reported. The southern coastal province of Sarangani registered intensity two while cities in South Cotabato recorded intensity one, the agency said. The region is home to 1.2 million people, or around 1 percent of the Philippine population, according to data from the statistics agency.

Please enter a search term.       ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A powerful earthquake located off Alaska’s southern coast jolted some coastal communities late Tuesday, and some residents briefly scrambled for higher ground over fears of a tsunami. There were no immediate reports of damage in the sparsely populated area of the state, and tsunami warning was canceled after the magnitude 7.8 quake off the Alaska Peninsula produced a wave of a less than a foot.  Because of its location, nearby communities along the Alaska Peninsula did not experience shaking that would normally be associated with that magnitude of a quake, said Michael West, Alaska State Seismologist.  “No reports of any damage,” Kodiak Police Sgt. Mike Sorter told The Associated Press early Wednesday morning. “No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal.” Kodiak is about 200 miles northeast of where the earthquake was centered. The tsunami warning had coastal residents evacuating for higher ground. Social media posts showed long lines of people fleeing towns like Homer and Kodiak while tsunami sirens wailed in the background. On Kodiak Island, the local high school opened its doors for evacuees, as did the local Catholic school, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “We’ve got a high school full of people,” said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. “I’ve been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,” he told the Daily News. “Everything’s as calm as can be. We’ve got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,” he said before the warning was canceled. Tsunami warnings are commonplace for people who grew up in Kodiak. ”I’ve been doing these since I was a little kid,” LeDoux told the newspaper. “Old news.” Officials at the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, began calling off tsunami advisories and warnings after a wave of only 25 centimeters (.8 foot) was recorded in the community of Sand Point. “I might have expected a little bit more water, but I’m happy that there wasn’t,” said David Hale, the senior duty scientist at the tsunami center. Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that caused damage in the Anchorage area in November 2018. “This earthquake released about 15 times as much energy as that earthquake, said West, the state seismologist. More than a dozen aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or higher were reported immediately after the earthquake, he said by telephone from the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ”We got people here who are going be working all night,” West said early Wednesday morning. ”These aftershocks will go and go and go and go.” The Alaska-Aleutian Trench was also where a magnitude 9.2 quake in 1964 was centered. That remains the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded. The temblor and ensuing tsunami caused widespread damage and killed 131 people, some as far away as Oregon and California. Alaska is the most actively seismic state. Nearly 25,000 earthquakes have been recorded in Alaska since Jan. 1, according to the center. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

USGS reports magnitude-6.4 earthquake in western Nevada,2020-05-15 11:45 UTC,https://www.ksat.com/news/national/2020/05/15/usgs-reports-magnitude-64-earthquake-in-western-nevada/,"See the complete list WEATHER ALERT Associated Press   Associated Press TONOPAH, Nev. – The cracked main highway between Las Vegas and Reno reopened Friday, 10 hours after a predawn magnitude 6.5 earthquake that a researcher called the largest to strike the remote area of western Nevada in 65 years. No injuries were reported, but officials said goods tumbled from market shelves, sidewalks heaved and storefront windows cracked shortly after 4 a.m. People from Salt Lake City to California’s Central Valley tweeted that they felt shaking. Lights swayed at the governor’s mansion in Carson City, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak told reporters. “It woke me up, so it definitely had an impact,” he said.  Nevada Highway Patrol photos showed cracks on U.S. 95 before crews repaired them about 35 miles (56 kilometers) west of Tonopah. A detour to State Route 360 had added more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) to motorists' trips. The vast open range east of the snow-capped Sierra Nevada is seismically active, said Graham Kent, director of the Nevada Seismological Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno. He ranked Friday's event with twin December 1954 earthquakes at Fairview Peak and Dixie Valley. Kent said those temblors were magnitudes 7.1 and 6.8, respectively. The U.S. Geological Survey reported Friday's temblor struck just east of the Sierra Nevada. It was initially reported at 6.4-magnitude. It was centered about 4.7 miles (7.6 kilometers) deep, the agency said, and dozens of aftershocks were recorded. Kent said a 5.1 magnitude aftershock struck about 30 minutes after the initial quake. State troopers and sheriff's patrols from Esmeralda and surrounding Mineral and Nye counties checked highways for possible damage. A sheriff's dispatcher in the historic mining boom town of Goldfield said the 112-year-old Esmeralda County Courthouse escaped damage. Nye County sheriff's Capt. David Boruchowitz reported no damage at the Mizpah Hotel and Clown Motel, two landmark businesses in Tonopah, a mining hub about halfway between Las Vegas and Reno. Keith Hasty, a Tonopah gas station employee, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that groceries were shaken off shelves and that residents said their televisions shook. Nye County spokesman Arnold Knightly reported broken storefront glass, stress cracks on asphalt streets, loose hanging signs, items knocked off shelves and minor lifting of sidewalks. “Overall, everything appears to be sound at this point,"" Knightly said. “”However, we have learned that other than obvious earthquake damage some damage is discovered later."" Last July, a 56-year-old backyard mechanic was found dead in Pahrump four days after strong quakes struck near Ridgecrest, California, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) away. Investigators said it appeared a Jeep he was repairing wobbled off its support jacks. State seismic network manager Ken Smith noted that Friday’s earthquake happened a few miles east of the site of a magnitude 6.2 temblor in July 1986 in California’s Chalfant Valley.  Larger earthquakes in the region in the last century included a 6.5-magnitude temblor in 1934 and a magnitude 6.8 quake in 1932, the state seismology lab said. A 6-magnitude earthquake in February 2008 damaged hundreds of structures in the northeast Nevada town of Wells, including its historic El Rancho Hotel and Casino. Officials recently announced plans to restore the hotel. ___ This story has been corrected to reference U.S. Geological Survey, not Service. ____ Associated Press writer Paul Davenport in Phoenix contributed to this report.

"A 5.7 magnitude earthquake shakes Utah, knocking out power in places",2020-03-18 20:50 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/us/utah-earthquake/index.html,"
      A 5.7 magnitude earthquake shook the Salt Lake City area Wednesday morning, cutting power to tens of thousands and suspending work at Utah’s public health lab amid the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.
    
      Flights to Salt Lake International Airport were diverted, departures were postponed and terminals and concourses were evacuated so engineers could inspect the facilities, the airport said.
   
      The quake was centered about 10 miles west of Salt Lake City, near the city of Magna, starting at 7:09 a.m. (9:09 a.m. ET), the US Geological Survey said.
   
      People in downtown Salt Lake City left buildings and gathered outside after the quake, talking about the shaking, CNN affiliate KSL reported.
   
      “It didn’t feel like a small earthquake at all. I heard things in my kitchen falling,” Michael McCarlie, who lives in an apartment at the City Creek Landing development in the capital, told KSL.
   
      This is the state’s most powerful quake since 1992, when a magnitude 5.9 temblor struck the St. George area, Utah’s Division of Emergency Management said.
   
      Operations at the state’s public health laboratory were halted as the building was assessed for damage, the state Department of Health said. 
   
      The state’s coronavirus hotline, which residents may call to request tests and seek information, was down after the quake, Gov. Gary Herbert said on Twitter – though the health department said a temporary information line was available.
   
      The Department of Health said its lab is being assessed for damage, and testing will resume when the building is “determined to be safe.”
   
      “There were no samples being tested at the time of the earthquake,” the department said in a media advisory posted on Twitter. “Additionally, no samples or laboratory equipment were damaged during the earthquake.”
   
      Commercial labs in the state are working and still processing Covid-19 tests, the department said.
   
      By the early afternoon there were about 10,000 customers without power, down from 73,000 immediately after the quake, Rocky Mountain Power reported.
   
      “Please stay away from the downtown area while crews assess damage,” Herbert said. “Unless you work in public safety, or are an essential employee, remain at home or telework.”
   
      The quake comes as Utah residents, like people across the world, are adjusting to changes brought by the coronavirus pandemic, including canceling schools and limiting mass gatherings.
   Here’s the shaking intensity map for this earthquake. As you can see, the stronger shaking is felt around the magna area and less intense shaking radiates outward.#Utquake pic.twitter.com/ifLrgdWrzG 
      “I know the last thing we need right now is an earthquake, but here we are, and it sounds like aftershocks are likely,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said on Twitter.
   
      At the city’s iconic Mormon temple, the quake dislodged the trumpet of the angel statue atop its highest spire, video from KSL showed.
   
      “The trumpet on the Angel Moroni statue fell off, and there is minor displacement of some of the temple’s smaller spire stones,” said Daniel Woodruff, a spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
    
      Aerial photos show the fallen trumpet appeared to have landed on the roof of the temple near the base of its spires.
   
      School districts in the area have been offering grab-and-go lunch pickup programs during the coronavirus break, but some districts canceled those programs Wednesday because of the earthquake, CNN affiliate KTVX reported.
   
      The airport said Wednesday afternoon it was resuming operations after checking for damage.
   
      “The airport has completed the security sweep and is preparing to allow passengers through. … Flights will begin arriving and departing,” the airport posted on Twitter.
   
      A water line that was damaged in Concourse D has been repaired, the airport said. 
   
      The first flight left for Dallas just before 3 p.m., the airport said later. 
   
      Because fewer people are flying during the coronavirus pandemic, “evacuating the terminal buildings was easier” than it would have normally been, airport director Bill Wyatt told reporters.
   
      The runways and taxiways were not damaged, Wyatt said. Some inbound planes were diverted to Denver or elsewhere, Wyatt said.
   
      The airport said a road to the airport initially was closed after the quake, but eventually was reopened late Wednesday morning so passengers could be picked up.
   
      The Utah Department of Transportation said it didn’t appear that the roads it’s responsible for were damaged, but workers were checking to make sure. Parts of Interstate 80 were temporarily closed so inspection crews could look at bridges, it said.
   
      Several aftershocks were recorded within 20 minutes of the main quake, according to the USGS, and dozens were recorded later, including one with a 4.6 magnitude Wednesday afternoon.
   
      Generally in Utah, earthquakes greater than magnitude 5 happen once every 10 years, and quakes greater than magnitude 6 happen once every 50 years, the USGS says. 
   
      That statement takes into account instrumentation records dating back to 1962 and historical records dating back to the 1850s, the USGS says.

He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize.

Turkey Ends Rescue Efforts After Earthquake Toll Reaches 41,2020-01-27 15:56 UTC,https://www.voanews.com/europe/turkey-ends-rescue-efforts-after-earthquake-toll-reaches-41,"

 ELAZIG, TURKEY — Turkey called off rescue operations on Monday in eastern areas hit by Friday's earthquake after emergency workers recovered the body of a final person they were searching for in a collapsed building, bringing the death toll to 41, authorities said. The magnitude 6.8 quake caused 37 deaths in Elazig province, about 550 km (340 miles) east of Ankara, and four in neighboring Malatya. More than 1,600 others were hurt, including 86 still being treated in hospitals, though none were in serious condition, the government said. Forty-five people had been rescued from under ruined buildings, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Authority (AFAD) said. Authorities have warned residents not to enter damaged buildings because of the danger of collapse and further aftershocks, leaving many without a home in a region where temperatures fell to -6C (21F) on Monday morning. Addressing reporters in Elazig, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the government would provide financial support to those whose homes were damaged. Some 1,000 temporary homes would be built, and some schools and mosques were now being used as shelters, he added. Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said authorities had started demolishing 22 damaged buildings in Elazig. Construction of some 2,000 new houses in the province was expected to be completed by year end, he added. Turkey has a history of powerful earthquakes. More than 17,000 people were killed in August 1999 when a 7.6 magnitude quake struck Izmit, a city southeast of Istanbul. In 2011, a quake in the eastern city of Van killed more than 500.   "
5.0 magnitude earthquake hits southern Puerto Rico amid ongoing tremors,2020-01-26 01:12 UTC,https://www.ozarksfirst.com/local-news/5-0-magnitude-earthquake-hits-southern-puerto-rico-amid-ongoing-tremors/,"KOLR - OzarksFirst.com Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       PUERTO RICO (CBS, AP) – A 5.0 magnitude earthquake hit southern Puerto Rico on Saturday at a shallow depth, raising concerns about unstable infrastructure in a region that has been hit by quakes every day for nearly a month. At least one small landslide was reported. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake occurred at a depth of eight miles around the southern coastal town of Guayanilla, located close to the epicenters of most of the recent earthquakes.  “We felt it really hard,” town spokesman Danny Hernandez told The Associated Press, saying authorities were patrolling the area to investigate any potential damage. The newest quake comes a day after hundreds of people in the island’s southern region were evacuated from earthquake shelters that flooded after heavy rains hit the U.S. territory. In the coastal city of Ponce alone, more than 350 people on Friday were moved back into a school that served as the initial shelter when the ground first began shaking, Angel Vazquez, the city’s emergency management director, told the AP. He said no damage was immediately reported in Ponce, but that crews were out inspecting buildings in areas affected by a 6.4 magnitude quake that hit January 7, killing one person and damaging hundreds of homes. A 5.9 aftershock that hit the same area on January 11 caused further damage. The ground in southern Puerto Rico first began shaking on December 28, and while experts say several local faults are to blame, they are still analyzing data to determine why the earthquakes continue. U.S. President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for more than a dozen municipalities in Puerto Rico following earthquakes that officials say have caused more than $200 million in damage. More than 4,000 people remain in shelters, and officials expected that number to rise as a result of Saturday’s quake. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Once it ends, there is a little bit of laughter. A pastor at the church said there was no damage to the church, but the shaking did knock over some pictures in his office. Other people have reported bricks breaking off chimneys and sidewalks cracking. The earthquake happened near where several others have happened in Reno County.

Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority said outages were reported across much of southern Puerto Rico and crews were assessing possible damage at power plants.  - American Red Cross -  Direct Relief Emergency Health Kit Bárbara Cruz, a prosecutor who was in the southern coastal city of Ponce when the new quake hit, said concrete debris hit the sidewalk as buildings continued to crumble. ""Everyone is out on the street,"" she said.  There were no immediate reports of injuries. The quake, which initially had been calculated at magnitude 6.0, was the strongest shake yet since a magnitude 6.4 quake - the strongest to hit the island in a century - struck before dawn on Tuesday, knocking out power across Puerto Rico and leaving many without water. More than 2,000 people remain in shelters, many fearful of returning to their homes, and others unable to because of extensive damage. Hundreds of quakes have shaken the island since the new year, though most were too slight to be felt. NASA reported Friday that the quakes had moved the land in parts of southern Puerto Rico as much as 5.5 inches, based on satellite images before and after the temblors. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico's Seismic Network, told The Associated Press that he expects still more aftershocks as a result of the latest large one. ""It's going to re-energize an unstable situation,"" he said, adding that seismologists are studying which faults were activated. ""It's a complex zone."" Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans are still without power and water, and thousands are staying in shelters and sleeping on sidewalks since Tuesday's earthquake. That temblor killed one person, injured nine others and damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and several schools and businesses in the island's southwest region.

Puerto Rico Faces Power Crisis After Earthquake,2020-01-09 17:54 UTC,https://miami.cbslocal.com/2020/01/09/puerto-rico-faces-power-crisis-after-earthquake/,"Watch CBS News

          / CBS Miami
         SAN JUAN (CBSMiami) - Puerto Rico continues to struggle after the strongest earthquake to hit the island in more than a century.  Residents are having to cope with strong aftershocks and some areas are still without running water or electricity.  A power plant in the southern end of the island was knocked offline by the quake. Angel Perez, the operations manager at the Costa Sur power plant, said the tanks thank are used to clean water were damaged. This function is the first step in the energy generation process.     With the tanks knocked over, ""we cannot even think to provide power to anybody,"" said Perez.  Those tanks the water is sent to even larger tanks which Perez said have also been damaged. ""There is a fracture in the metal, okay, in the base of the tank,"" said Perez.  The power plant's control room was also damaged, it's not safe for anyone to work there.  With Costa Sur not generating any energy, hundreds of thousands of people will be without power. Perez said they are working on repairs around the clock and it will most likely be more than a month before they are back online and producing electricity. That's a conservative estimate compared that to what the head of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority said.  ""The facility will be out for, probably, over a year,"" said Jose Ortiz.  The bottom line, the Costa Sur plant is pivotal because 25 percent of the island's power comes from it. As of now, it doesn't appear the top leadership is on the same page as to when they can get it back up and running.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."
Puerto Rico residents sleeping outside as aftershocks rattle a region on edge after deadly earthquake,2020-01-08 16:22 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/08/us/puerto-rico-earthquake-wednesday/index.html,"
      Roughly two-thirds of Puerto Rico remains without electricity, many still don’t have water and frightened residents were staying outside as a series of aftershocks rocked the island following a magnitude 6.4 earthquake.
   
      The quake was the strongest and likely the most damaging of hundreds of temblors that have struck the island since December 28. It hit before dawn Tuesday, leaving a man dead and causing dozens of homes and structures to crumble. 
    
      Tuesday’s earthquake was centered off Puerto Rico’s southern coast, six miles south of Indios. Terrified of sleeping indoors as aftershocks continue, neighbors put mattresses in their front yards while others spent the night under white tents and tarps. 
   
      Terrified of sleeping indoors as aftershocks continue, neighbors put mattresses in their front yards while others spent the night Tuesday under white tents and tarps. 
   
      Noelia de Jesus has been sleeping at an outdoors shelter with her granddaughters, terrified of returning to her home in Guanica.
   
      “I’ve been crying ever since it happened,” de Jesus told CNN. “Everything is broken…the house is leaning to the right. If another (earthquake) comes, it’s going to go down.”
   
      It’s the third time that a natural disaster leaves her without a place to live. Like her, many Puerto Ricans lost their homes when Hurricane Maria hit and Hurricane George struck in 1998.
   
      Guanica Mayor Santos Seda said about 50 homes were destroyed by the earthquake and at least 100 more were “about to collapse” on Wednesday.
   
      Hundreds of aftershocks have hit the area in the past few days. As of Wednesday afternoon, the island in just 24 hours had experienced about 50 seismic events of magnitude 2.5 or higher, the US Geological Survey said.
    
      Residents and officials have repeatedly said the impact from the quakes surpasses the devastation that Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm when it hit the island, delivered two years ago. 
   
      “With the hurricane, you knew when and at what time it would arrive,” Guayanilla resident Tatiana Rodriguez, 28, said, adding of the quakes, “This, you don’t know at what time it’s going to happen.”
   
      The town of 18,000 located near the southern coast hasn’t been getting regular updates, she said. Residents are disinclined to leave their homes because they don’t know what areas are safe. Rodriguez worries that recovery will be difficult, especially for those hit hard by Maria, she said. 
   
      “There are a lot of people that started from zero because of Maria,” she said. “(They’re) starting again from zero.”
   
      Ashley Ramirez Perez, 22, hasn’t seen her partner since Saturday. He was receiving treatment at a clinic in Guanica, about 12 miles west of Guayanilla, but patients were moved after the quakes and she doesn’t know where he is. She doesn’t think he knows where she is, either, she said. 
   
      Perez and her relatives, including her 58-year-old father, took shelter at Gloria Maria Borrero School in Guayanilla after Perez’s apartment began “separating from the sidewalk,” she said. She’s been without power for two days, and the balcony of her apartment is “a bit toppled” as well, she told CNN on Tuesday. 
   
      “I never thought a quake would destroy so much,” she said. “Hurricane Maria was nothing compared to this.”
   
      Much of Puerto Rico is still without power Wednesday as engineers work to restore it in phases. About 500,000 customers, roughly one-third of the island, are back on the grid, the Electric Energy Authority said in a tweet. 
   
      A system-wide power outage was reported after the Costa Sur power plant near Guayanilla suffered severe damage Tuesday, Vázquez Garced said.
   
      “We lost the largest plant in the entire system,” said Jose Ortiz, executive director of the Electric Power Authority. 
   
      Power has been restored in most hospitals, and crews are working to fully restore it by the weekend, Ortiz said. A nursing home in Ponce was evacuated and dozens of people in wheelchairs were waiting outside. 
   
      Guanica experienced at least 10 aftershocks Wednesday before 8 a.m. (7 a.m. ET), Mayor Seda said. 
   
      More than 200 people took shelter at a Guanica coliseum, he said, but fearful for their safety if the building were toppled, they relocated to the parking lot.
   
      “So much worse than Maria, because a hurricane, we can tell where the hurricane is coming through, but we don’t with an earthquake,” Seda told CNN. “Yesterday, my wife and I slept on the sidewalk right outside my house, and we saw the same thing everywhere.”
   
      Classes won’t resume across the island until crews inspect all schools and confirm buildings are safe for students, education officials announced.
   
      The Agripina Seda School in Guanica suffered major damage, including a partially collapsed, three-story building. 
   
      “Classes in the public school system won’t resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,” Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won’t return to the schools until further notice. 
   
      The earthquakes come after Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory in September 2017. Many in southern Puerto Rico said the earthquakes’ damage was worse.  
   
      “There’s no warnings for this,” Puerto Rico Police Commissioner Henry Escalera said of the earthquakes. “A hurricane gives us time to plan ahead.”
   
      The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced aid has been made available to supplement local response efforts.
   
      President Donald Trump’s action authorizes FEMA to coordinate all disaster relief efforts and provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures to save lives and protect property.

Deadly earthquake hits Puerto Rico,2020-01-07 14:08 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/puerto-rico-earthquake-01-07-2020/index.html,"By Eric Levenson, CNN Our live coverage of this story has ended. You can read more about the Puerto Rico earthquakes here. From CNN's Gregory Wallace FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, received Puerto Rico's request for an emergency declaration from the earthquake that occurred earlier Tuesday, and that request is under consideration, the agency said. Acting FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor has been in constant communication and coordination with Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vazquez, FEMA said. FEMA personnel in Puerto Rico are working closely with the Puerto Rico Emergency Management Bureau and have deployed two Incident Management Assistance Teams to the island, the agency said. Additionally, FEMA activated its Response Operations Cell in Washington and Regional Response Coordination Center in New York to assist with any additional resource needs. ""FEMA remains committed to supporting the government of Puerto Rico with its ongoing recovery efforts from Hurricanes Irma and Maria and to helping people before, during and after disasters,"" the agency said.  From CNN's Kate Trafecante The earthquakes along the southern coast of Puerto Rico could cost the island up to $3.1 billion in economic losses, according to Chuck Watson, an analyst with Enki, a disaster research group.  The estimate accounts for damage to both public and private property, as well as lost tourism, wages and business due to power outages. Watson said the estimate is high due to multiple aftershocks hitting already weak structures, as well as the lingering effects of Hurricane Maria. Some of the infrastructure damage from the 2017 storm has still not been repaired, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. CNN’s Angela Barajas contributed to this report. From CNN’s Angela Barajas Puerto Rico's Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced announced Tuesday that $130 million in emergency aid has been made available in response to both earthquakes. The governor also pleaded for everyone to remain calm and to prepare for any future seismic activity at a Tuesday morning news conference. Vázquez said preliminary findings show that 255 people have sought refuge at different shelters in the southern part of the island. Close to 300,000 clients are without water service, she said. Vazquez said there are power outages throughout the southern part of the island but engineers are already working on reestablishing service. Power plants had automatically shut off as a safety mechanism following Monday's quake, but Tuesday's quake caused damage to them, according to the governor. Damage to some roads was reported -- but there were no reports of significant damage to bridges or dams.  “We have responded to many difficult situations, and here we are once again and we will do it the same way, helping our people move forward.” said Vázquez.  From CNN's Betsy Klein President Donald Trump has been briefed on the earthquakes in Puerto Rico. ""The President has been briefed on the earthquakes that Puerto Rico has experienced over the past month, including the earthquake early this morning,"" spokesman Judd Deere said. ""Administration officials, including FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, have been in touch with the governor and her team today, and we will continue to monitor the effects and coordinate with Puerto Rico officials."" From CNN's Amanda Watts New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is redirecting personnel from the New York Power Authority who were already deployed in Puerto Rico to help restore power following several earthquakes that have hit the island, a statement from his office says. ""During difficult times, the State of New York always stands with and supports our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico -- and today is no different,"" Gov. Cuomo said.  The NYPA already had a team of ten technical power experts on the island assisting Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria. The team “has been working to address recent blackouts and stabilize the island's power systems to avoid power outages,” the statement says.  “Once this team has completed its work to help restore power after the earthquake, it will resume its collaborative efforts with PREPA to harden Puerto Rico's electric system so it is better prepared to withstand all kinds of natural disasters in the future.”  Riko Gonzalez described the 6.0 and 6.4 earthquakes as ""horrible."" ""People are afraid to go to bed to then be woken up to worse earthquakes than the day before."" Gonzalez shared a number of photos on Facebook that show the rubble and destruction around Yauco, a city in southwest Puerto Rico. ""Luckily (communications) are up so we check on each other periodically. But if it wasn’t for that there would be panic,"" Gonzalez said.     The earthquakes on Monday and Tuesday struck to the southwest of Puerto Rico, at the opposite end of the island from its capital, San Juan. The US Geological Survey said that they struck in the area where the North American tectonic plate converges with the Caribbean tectonic plate. Gov. Wanda Vazquez Garced has signed a state of emergency declaration for the island, thus activating the National Guard of Puerto Rico. Please enable JavaScript for a better experience."

Croatia hit by 6.3 magnitude earthquake,2020-12-29 14:37 UTC,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/29/europe/croatia-earthquake-6-3-magnitude-petrinja-intl/index.html,"
      At least seven people were killed and dozens were injured after a powerful 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck central Croatia on Tuesday, according to the US Geological Survey and Croatian officials.  
   
      Emergency crews, assisted by the military, were still digging through the rubble in several towns as night fell and electricity remained out.
   
      The quake, which struck just after noon local time about 30 miles southeast of the capital Zagreb, could be felt across the Balkans. It is the largest quake to hit Croatia this year, according to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre.
   
      Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the death toll was expected to rise. And he appealed to private citizens not to go to the worst-hit town, Petrinja, which was near the epicenter.
   
      “At this moment, we don’t know exactly how many people have died. The latest information before the core cabinet meeting was seven people,” Plenkovic said. “We have some indication that this number may be higher, so we’ll wait and see for the police’s official report.”
   
      A girl in the town of Petrinja, a man found inside a collapsed church in the village of Žažina, and five men in the village of Majske Poljane, were among the dead, according to Croatia’s Interior Ministry and local media reports.  
   
      “We are doing everything we can to help the citizens of Petrinja and surrounding areas in this dramatic and tragic situation,” Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic said in a tweet. 
   
      “The destructive earthquake has taken human lives, destroyed homes, and we deeply sympathise with every person and every family that has been harmed.”  
   
      Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic told CNN affiliate N1 that the town of nearly 25,000 residents was “going through hell” after the tremor, and had no running water or electricity. He has requested emergency aid.
   
      “I feel that both its center and its soul have been destroyed,” Dumbovic said. “We have no electricity, no water. Everything is broken. We are here in darkness, in ruin, searching for people,” he added.
   
      HEP, the state electricity provider, said it had managed to restore power to parts of the quake-hit area; however Petrinja and its hospital remain dark, N1 reported. HEP said it was hoping to restore some power during the evening.
   
      Footage from inside the hospital showed medical staff working by torchlight as they awaited the evacuation of some patients.
   
      All the patients in Petrinja hospital have now been evacuated, as well as 80% of those who were in Sisak hospital, the Prime Minister said Tuesday evening. The patients were evacuated by the military – mostly to Zagreb.
   
      More than 250 members of the Croatian armed forces are on the ground, according to a statement from Defense Minister Mario Banozic, shared by the Croatian government’s official Twitter account.
   
      “The military barrack in Petrinja is open and can provide adequate accommodation for those who have lost a roof over their heads. The army shall be here for however long it is needed,” the tweet said.
   
      In dramatic footage captured by N1, the mayor was giving a press conference on camera about the previous day’s smaller earthquake when Tuesday’s quake struck. In the video, a rumbling sound can be heard as the earthquake begins, followed by muddled shrieks from the attendees. The camera then appears to fall to the ground. 
   
      In an earlier interview with N1, Dumbović described scenes of “panic” in the aftermath of the tremor. 
   
      “We are pulling people out of cars, we don’t know if people have died or have been injured. I heard a kindergarten has collapsed but luckily there weren’t any children there, while in another one the children were able to escape,” the mayor said.
   
      Plenkovic visited the towns close to the epicenter of the earthquake, as search and rescue missions continued.
   
      “I’d like to express my condolences to the families of the victims of the earthquake in Petrinja and Glina. We hope that the number of victims will be as low as possible,” Plenkovic said in a tweet.
   
      “All emergency services are in action on the field and are working tirelessly to provide help to all those who need it,” he added.
   
      The Arena sports hall in Zagreb, which was turned into an emergency care center for coronavirus patients, will also begin to take in coronavirus patients from the county of Sisak-Moslavina, which was affected the earthquake, HINA reported. 
   
      Krsko nuclear power plant in Slovenia, close to Zagreb, has been closed as a precaution, N1 reported.
   
      The Prime Minister said the government has secured 120 million kuna ($19 million) from the state budget to help with the response. Croatia has also activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which helps provide disaster relief.

Magnitude-7.0 earthquake strikes off Greece and Turkey in the Aegean Sea,2020-10-30 12:50 UTC,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/30/europe/earthquake-greece-turkey-aegean-intl/index.html,"
      At least 27 people were killed in Turkey and Greece when a powerful earthquake hit the Aegean Sea on Friday afternoon, sending buildings crashing down and triggering what authorities have called a “mini tsunami.”
   
      Officials said 25 people were killed in coastal areas in Turkey’s west, while two teenagers – a boy and a girl – died on the Greek island of Samos after a wall collapsed on them.
   
      In Turkey, at least 20 buildings in the city of Izmir alone were destroyed, Mayor Tunc Soyer told CNN Turk. Images showed vehicles crushed under the buildings and people digging through the rubble in search of survivors. 
   
      At least 804 people have been injured in Turkey, said the country’s disaster agency. Dozens were saved by rescue teams using diggers and helicopters to search for survivors.
   
      A total of 470 aftershocks have been recorded, 35 of which were over 4.0 magnitude, the agency added. Search and rescue operations remain under way in eight buildings, while operations have been completed in nine other buildings, the disaster agency said.
   
      Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that among Turkey’s injured, five people were being operated on and eight were in intensive care.
   
      TV footage showed water flooding through the streets of Cesme and Seferihisar in parts of Turkey’s wider Izmir province, as well as on the Greek island of Samos, in what officials described as a “mini tsunami.” No tsunami warnings were issued.
   
      Idil Gungor, who works as a journalist and runs a guesthouse in the Turkish town of Siğacik in Izmir province, said that the area was damaged more by the force of the water than the quake itself. 
   
      Her guesthouse, in a 100-year-old building, had been inundated and fish were swimming inside it, she said. Shops in town have also been flooded and their goods damaged.
   
      “Everybody is calm but shocked and we’re wondering what will happen, if there’s a second tsunami coming or not,” Gungor said.
   
      Zeki Soysal, also a resident in Izmir province, told CNN Turk that he made it out of his office building just before it collapsed. 
   
      “There was an older woman in the building but we saved her, she got out. There is another building close to this building. They are continuing to try to get the people out,” he said.
   
      The United States Geological Survey (USGS) measured the tremor’s magnitude at 7.0, while Turkish authorities said it was 6.6. The quake struck 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) northeast of the town of Néon Karlovásion on Samos, the USGS reported, at 1:51 pm Greek time (7:51a.m. ET).
   
      But it hit at a relatively shallow depth of 21 kilometers (13 miles), the USGS reported, making its impact powerfully felt at ground level around the epicenter.
   
      Authorities in both countries have reported dozens of aftershocks. Izmir Governor Yavuz Selim Köşger called on residents to stay off the roads and refrain from using mobile phones unnecessarily so that emergency vehicles could reach affected areas and response teams could communicate effectively.
   
      In Greece, Samos Deputy Mayor Giorgos Dionisiou told Greek media that some old buildings had collapsed on the island.
   
      People have been told by Greek authorities to stay away from the shore and buildings, and to be on alert for high waves as aftershocks continue.
   
      Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Twitter he had spoken to his Turkish counterpart. Tensions between the two nations have flared recently over energy claims in the eastern Mediterranean.  
   
      “I just called President @RTErdogan to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,” Mitsotakis wrote.
    
In a tweet, the Turkish president offered his condolences to Greece and said “that two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life.”
   
      “Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds,” Erdogan added. 
   
      According to Erdogan, both Turkey and Greece were ready to send aid to the other.
   
      French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said on Twitter his country had offered to send assistance to Turkey and Greece. 
   
      “France stands alongside the Turkish and Greek peoples in facing this terrible ordeal,” Darmanin said. 
   
      “If the governments of these countries so wish, French aid can be immediately sent to the scene.”
   
      The leaders of France and Turkey have recently traded barbs over freedom of speech and Islamist extremism, following the killing of a Paris teacher who had shown his students cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed by the magazine Charlie Hebdo.
   
      Erdogan has not publicly responded to the French interior minister’s tweet. 
   
      He earlier tweeted, “Get well soon Izmir” after the quake hit.
   
      “With all the means of our state, we stand by our citizens affected by the earthquake. We took action to start the necessary work in the region with all our relevant institutions and ministers,” Erdogan wrote.
   
      The President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, tweeted, “My thoughts are with all the Greek and Turkish people affected by the strong earthquake that hit the Aegean Sea.
   
      “Together with the other EU institutions, we are following the situation closely. The EU stands ready to help.”

Tsunami warning issued after earthquake near Alaska,2020-10-19 22:11 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/19/us/alaska-earthquake/index.html,"
      The magnitude 7.5 earthquake near Sand Point, Alaska, generated a tsunami, Scott Langley with the National Tsunami Warning Center said Monday afternoon.
   
      Langley said the tsunami sent two waves, each measuring 130 centimeters (4 feet, 3 inches) high. But observers onshore reported the waves appeared to be 1.5 feet (45.7 centimeters) and 2 feet (61 cm) over high tide. 
   
      The center is monitoring harbors in a 500-mile area along the Alaska coastline, he said.
   
      Tsunami advisories issued for parts of Alaska and the state of Hawaii following the earthquake were canceled Monday night, according to tweets from the National Weather Service Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (NWS PTWC).
   
      Langley said earlier the area in Alaska that had been subject to the warning and advisory is “pretty remote.” 
   
      “For other US and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America, there is no tsunami threat,” the center said.
   
      The earthquake’s epicenter was recorded less than 60 miles from Sand Point, near the Aleutian Peninsula in the southwestern part of the state.
   
      “We did feel it,” Sand Point Clinic employee Lorna Osterback said of the quake. “This is a big one.”
   
      Osterback said residents of the town would be heading to higher ground away from the shoreline as they wait out the tsunami threat.  
   
      “We expect we will have another one in about half an hour,” noted Osterback. “We’re right on the fault line. I grew up here and it’s kind of normal.” 
   
      Jeanette Piniones Navales moved her family from Kodiak Island to higher ground on Pillar Mountain when the tsunami alerts sounded Monday. She said she has lived in Kodiak since 2014 and this is her sixth time experiencing a tsunami warning.
   
      “I got nervous and immediately convinced my family to move (to) high ground to be safe,” she told CNN.
   Tsunami warning again 😱 Be safe everyone.. Move to high ground, Keep away from coast until local officials say it is safe to return. 
      Candace Nelson, her kids and dogs hid under the table as the earthquake shook Cold Bay, about 90 miles west of Sand Point.
   
      “My kids are all doing good. Brooke, Wilder and Scout all huddled under our kitchen table till the shaking stopped,” she told CNN as the family waited for more news about the tsunami. “The dogs were more concerned as to what the heck we were doing under the table.”
   
      Residents of Homer could also be seen driving to higher ground after being given evacuation orders. 
   
      Several aftershocks, including one with a magnitude of 5.9 and one that was 5.8, struck in the hour after the big quake.

According to HVO geophysicist, Jefferson Chang, the earthquake had no apparent effect on Kīlauea or Mauna Loa volcanoes.  “This earthquake appears to be part of the seismic swarm under the Pāhala area, which has been going on for over a year. Out of over ten thousand earthquakes that were detected in the area, a few have been large enough to be felt. We see no detectable changes in activity at the summits or along the rift zones of Mauna Loa or Kīlauea as a result of these earthquakes.” HVO continues to monitor Hawaiian volcanoes for any changes.  Earthquakes beneath Kīlauea’s lower Southwest Rift Zone are produced mostly at depths of 15-25 miles, beneath the town of Pāhala and extending about six miles offshore.

Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed and another injured in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise he said reports were of minor damage such as broken windows and collapsed walls. Ports, airports and refineries were not damaged, he said in a video-recorded phone conversation with his civil defense chief. There had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out to some areas.  Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.  It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico. In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued. “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves three to 10 feet above tide levels along parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru and Ecuador. Guatemala’s national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea.

Officials also warned of the potential for tsunami waves to strike the coast of Mexico and central America, which never emerged. The temblor was listed as a 7.4 on the Richter scale by the USGS, with the epicenter about 200 miles south of Mexico City along the coast of Oaxaca. Videos posted to social media showed the ground moving and telephone poles swaying in Mexico City, where the shaking drove people out of buildings and into the streets. Bloomberg News reported that a fire at Mexico’s largest oil refinery temporarily lead to a halt in operations, but Reuters says work at the facility was quickly resumed Tuesday after the blaze was put out. One of the casualties from the earthquake was a worker at the refinery who died in a fall during the shaking.  The USGS estimates that 26,000 people may have been exposed to the strongest shaking in Oaxaca and that a significant number of fatalities and property damage are possible. Developing Story... "

         PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- A member of the class of 2020 has overcome significant obstacles on his way to graduation. From an earthquake to a school shooting, and finishing senior year during a pandemic, Northeast High School student Kenny Kernizan has walked a unique journey. Tuesday was the day high school seniors across Philadelphia got to celebrate together. For Kernizan, overcoming a tremendous amount of adversity pushed him to the finish line. He stood proud in his black cap and gown Tuesday and he and his family, including those watching from Haiti, celebrated. ""It was very, very, very difficult,"" Kernizan said. Kernizan survived the 2010 earthquake in Haiti that left his mother injured and their family homeless for weeks. ""She was sitting in the streets crying and I was crying too. I was depressed,"" he said. Looking for a new life in the United States, Kernizan had no idea he would face the deadly shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where his football coach died protecting students. ""He died for us and he's a hero,"" Kernizan said. Even then, his family's faith never wavered. He may not be walking across a stage, but after overcoming such adversity, the district is also proud. ""Your class has handled the uncertainty and unrest with such poise, grace, and resiliency. The potential in this class is simply extraordinary,"" School District of Philadelphia Superintendent Dr. William Hite said. The celebration lasted all day Tuesday, with a special message from a former Philly graduate. ""I know that this is not how you planned your graduation. You planned to walk those same steps that everybody else did but honey, you can wear somebody else's shoes but you cannot walk in their feet. This is your path. Congratulations, you're doing it,"" singer and actress Jill Scott said. It's been a long road but all 13,000 graduates finally made it. For Kernizan, through all his tribulations, he managed to learn English while in high school.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

And a 20-mile-long stretch of it is going to be closed for two weeks starting Wednesday. From 6am on the 3rd and scheduled to run until 4pm, Wednesday the 17th, the 95 will be shut down on the south end at us highway 6 around the town of Coaldale to state highway 360 on the north (that’s about 9 miles south of Mina).   NDOT estimates this will cost drivers up to half-an-hour. The federal government is paying close to 2-and-a-half million dollars for repairs along the 95 in Esmeralda and Mineral counties. There were emergency repairs the day of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake on May 15th with the 95 reopened to traffic later that day, although the Nevada Dept of Transportation said at the time that long-term work would still need to be done, and that’s what’s starting on Wednesday, with a note that the work is subject to changes as events pop up, including weather.

A 15-year-old was reported in critical condition and several others were injured, news outlets reported.  Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said earthquake was the biggest in Zagreb in the last 140 years. Advertisement Many buildings in the capital cracked and walls and rooftops were damaged. Downtown streets were littered with debris. Concrete slabs fell on cars and chimneys landed in front of entrances. Footage from the scene showed mothers dressed in nightgowns hugging their newborn babies in a parking lot as they evacuated a damaged maternity hospital amid freezing temperatures. The women, newborn babies and incubators were being moved to a new location with the help of the army. Zagreb's iconic cathedral was also damaged, with the top of one of its two spires collapsing. The cathedral was rebuilt after it toppled in the 1880 earthquake. Power was cut as people ran out of their homes. Several fires were also reported. At least two other tremors were recorded later. Residents shared photos of belongings falling off shelves, broken bottles and glass inside homes. Officials first said a 15-year-old was killed, but doctors later said that she is in critical condition and that they are fighting for her life. They gave no immediate details on the extent of other injuries. The earthquake struck amid a partial lockdown of the capital because of the spread of the coronavirus. People were told to avoid public areas, such as parks and public squares, but had little choice as they fled their residences. Advertisement Up to five people are allowed to be together while keeping distance. The prime minister urged the citizens to remain calm and stay outside their homes in the central parts of Zagreb, which sustained the most damage. “We have two parallel crisis that contradict each other,” Plenkovic said after an emergency meeting of Croatia's top officials. Croatian soldiers wearing masks and carrying shovels could be seen helping efforts to clear the damage on the streets of Zagreb. Top officials toured the damaged areas as some citizens criticized city authorities over the poor states of buildings in the old part of the city, some of which date back to the 19th century. ""We will try to clear the streets as soon as possible,"" the prime minister said. “Stay outside your homes and keep distance.” Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic said the situation was complicated by the restrictive virus-related measures in place. ""There are rules for when there is an earthquake, but when there is an earthquake at the same time when there is a global pandemic, then it's a much more complex situation."" Bozinovic told the state HINA news agency. ___ Associated Press writers Dusan Stojanovic and Jovana Gec contributed to this report.

"5.7 Magnitude earthquake strikes near Salt Lake City, knocking out power",2020-03-18 14:06 UTC,https://kdvr.com/news/nationalworld-news/5-7-magnitude-earthquake-strikes-near-salt-lake-city-knocking-out-power/,"FOX31 Denver Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       (CNN) — A 5.7 magnitude earthquake shook Utah’s Salt Lake City area Wednesday morning, knocking out power in some areas, officials said.  “From what we have been able to determine, it doesn’t appear this was major shaking,” Utah’s Division of Emergency Management posted on Twitter shortly after the earthquake. Still, power has been knocked out in some areas, and aftershocks are likely, the division said. Details about the extent of the outages weren’t immediately available. At least six aftershocks had been recorded within 20 minutes of the main quake, according to the USGS. This is the state’s most powerful quake since 1992, when a magnitude 5.9 temblor struck the St. George area, the division said. Generally in Utah, earthquakes greater than magnitude 5 happen once every 10 years, and quakes greater than magnitude 6 happen once every 50 years, the USGS says. That statement takes into account instrumentation records dating back to 1962, and historical records dating back to the1850s, th USGS says.

9 dead in Turkey as 5.7 earthquake hits western Iran,2020-02-23 16:54 UTC,https://myfox8.com/news/nine-dead-in-turkey-as-5-7-earthquake-strikes-western-iran/,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.        ANKARA, Turkey  — Nine people were killed in Turkey in a magnitude 5.7 earthquake that hit western Iran early Sunday morning, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. The quake centered west of the Iranian city of Khoy and affected villages in the Turkish province of Van. Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told a news conference that three children and four adults were killed in Turkey’s Baskule district. Koca later updated the number of fatalities to nine and wrote on Twitter that 37 people were injured, including nine in a critical but not life-threatening condition. Emergency teams have been sent to the remote mountainous region. Iran’s official IRNA news agency said the earthquake affected 43 villages in the mountainous Qotour area. It later added that at least 75 people had been injured, six of whom were hospitalized.  The region has a history of powerful earthquakes. Last month a quake centered on the eastern Turkish city of Elazig killed more than 40 people. In 2011, more than 600 were killed when a quake struck north of Van province’s capital. Turkish broadcaster NTV showed images of locals and soldiers digging through the rubble of collapsed buildings as families fearing further tremors sat in snowy streets. The EMSC reported several further quakes that measured up to magnitude 4.4. The effects of the quake hit four villages in Van. Seven of the fatalities occurred in Ozpinar village, where Soylu said search and rescue teams had arrived. He added that the quake caused 1,066 buildings to collapse while the Education Ministry said a number of schools were damaged. Koca said 25 ambulances, a medical helicopter and 13 emergency teams had been sent to the region. The Disaster and Emergency Management Directorate (AFAD) said 144 tents for families had been dispatched.

 A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday, shaking a vast area from Mexico to Florida and beyond, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or heavy damage.  Dr. Enrique Arango Arias, head of Cuba's National Seismological Service, told state media that there had been no serious damage or injuries reported. The quake was felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Roman Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago. ""We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,"" she said. ""We heard the noise of everything moving around."" She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. ""It felt very strong but it doesn't look like anything happened,"" she told The Associated Press. It was also felt a little farther east at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the southeastern coast of the island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages, said J. Overton, a spokesman for the installation, which has a total population of about 6,000 people. Several South Florida buildings were evacuated as a precaujtion, according to city of Miami and Miami-Dade County officials. No injuries or road closures had been reported. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. Witness reports The islands experience so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. ""It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,"" Morales said. ""Then it continued and got more intense."" Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she saw manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage. Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway. ""It felt to me like I was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,"" he said. He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize.  "

Another Strong Earthquake Hits Puerto Rico,2020-01-07 09:47 UTC,https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/earthquake/2020/01/07/another-strong-earthquake-hits-puerto-rico," Get the best experience and stay connected to your community with our Spectrum News app. Learn More  Get hyperlocal forecasts, radar and weather alerts. Please enter a valid zipcode. Save SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico â One of the strongest earthquakes in a generation rattled Puerto Rico before dawn Tuesday, the second one in as many days. At least one person is dead, and the governor has declared a state of emergency.   At least eight people were injured in the city of Ponce, near the epicenter of the quake, Mayor Mayita MelÃ©ndez told WAPA television. Roads in Tallaboa, west of Ponce, were impassable, and some buildings severely damaged. Puerto Rico's power authority said on Twitter that one of the country's main power plants, which sits near the epicenter, had been damaged. Officials said they expected to restore power to the island later Tuesday.  The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at magnitude 6.4, with more than two dozen aftershocks ranging from 3.8 to 5.8. In a Facebook Messenger interview, Felix J. Quirindongo Muniz of Altamonte Springs shared pictures with Spectrum News 13 that his family and friends took of the destruction in the U.S. territory. He also shared his worry for his family who live in Puerto Rico.  ""It's overwhelming, really. My dad is bedridden, and we're going to try to move here. It's hard. There's no power in the whole island and no news from Vieques and Culebra,"" Muniz said. He said his parents and cousins are moving to another house because their home was damaged in Tuesday's quake.  ""Cousins moving together also, just to be together and help each other. Some cracks on the walls and ceilings. They don't want to risk it ...,"" he shared.  Camille Feliciano, 73, lives in the western region of Puerto Rico. She said she thought she was safe from the earthquake but woke to her home shaking.  ""I was sleeping in the second floor, so I ran down then went outside, and then the lights went out,"" Feliciano said.  Feliciano said she is afraid a bigger earthquake may hit her island.  âYou just feel very anxious, because you donât know if itâs going to continue or if itâs going to get worse,"" she said. Tampa resident Vilmari Nazario has family in Ponce, near the epicenter. She says they are nervous and scared, but otherwise OK. It stirred up feelings reminiscent of those moments following Hurricane Maria. âYeah, I feel a lot of fear, anxiety because I have family and friends there and itâs hard being so far away and not being with them,â she said. At least one person was reported dead. Teacher Rey GonzÃ¡lez told the Associated Press that his uncle was killed when a wall collapsed on him at the home they shared. He said 73-year-old Nelson MartÃ­nez was disabled and that he and his father cared for him. Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda VÃ¡zquez Garced has signed a state of emergency declaration and activated the island's National Guard. She tweeted in Spanish that the government is ready to assist. Espero que todos estÃ©n bien. Estamos recibiendo la informaciÃ³n de @NMEADpr y @DSPnoticias. Todo el componente gubernamental estÃ¡ activado y en ejecuciÃ³n. A nuestro pueblo calma y les exhortamos a que permanezcan seguros. Both Florida U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, along with Puerto Rico Rep. Jenniffer GonzÃ¡lez-ColÃ³n, sent a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to approve the governor's disaster declaration request. On Monday, a 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck the island, with its epicenter near Indios. It led to widespread power outages and small landslides, with cars crushed and boulders blocking highways. For those in Florida with family back on the island, getting in touch with loved ones was critical after seeing images of the aftermath. ""It's very sad for all the families that are suffering from this catastrophe,"" said Aldofina Ortiz who lives in Orlando but has family living in Puerto Rico. In September 2017, Hurricane Maria ravaged the island. Some residents in remote, mountainous areas were still living without power almost two years later. According to the Puerto Rico Seismic Network, one of the strongest earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico struck in 1918. That quake was 7.3 and caused severe damage to bridges and homes and triggered landslides and a tsunami. The 1918 quake killed 116 people. In the wake of the earthquakes, airlines are waiving change and cancellation fees for travelers to and from the island this week.  Most passengers Spectrum News spoke to at Orlando International Airport coming from San Juan, Puerto Rico, said they were concerned to leave their family behind, given the circumstances.  Irving Ocasio from Fajardo said the island needs all the help it can get. ""The island is not 100 percent what it was. After Hurricane Maria the electricity comes and goes. Right after these trembles the island went pitch black... The electrical system in Puerto Rico needs help,"" he described. Help from the Mainland The Hispanic Federation is teaming up with other organizations to help the people on the island. The organization has already distributed 30,000 solar lamps to those in Puerto Rico who donât have power. ""A light makes a difference. Itâs a hope in the midst of the dark, so we know its essential for our families there,"" said Yanidsi Velez, Florida Director of the Hispanic Federation. Velez said the team is still in the early stages of planning, but the group is getting ready to help the people living in Puerto Rico like they did for Hurricane Maria. If you like to help the Hispanic Federation, head to the group's website. The Associated Press contributed to this story."

      A 4.0 magnitude earthquake struck near Bliss Corner, Massachusetts, on Sunday morning, according to preliminary information from the US Geological Survey. 
   
      The temblor was felt more than 100 miles away, in Burlington, Connecticut, Manchester, New Hampshire and Sound Beach, New York, on Long Island, the USGS says. 
   
      According to a USGS map, the quake struck off Mishaum Point, a peninsula in southeastern Massachusetts that extends into Buzzards Bay. 
   
      The epicenter appears to be about 4 miles south-southwest of Bliss Corner, which is located in the town of Dartmouth, just south of New Bedford and about 35 miles southeast of Providence, Rhode Island. 
   
      There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, and the USGS said there is a low likelihood of casualties or economic losses. 
   
      There is no threat of tsunami, the National Weather Service says. 
   
      Small temblors strike New England and Long Island roughly twice a year, while moderate quakes hit the region every few decades, the USGS says.
   
      The most recent New England quake to cause considerable damage was a 5.6 magnitude that shook central New Hampshire in 1940, the survey says.

"5.1-magnitude earthquake strikes north of Charlotte, along North Carolina-Virginia border",2020-08-09 19:49 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/09/us/north-carolina-earthquake-charlotte/index.html,"
      A 5.1-magnitude earthquake hit about 2 miles from the town of Sparta, North Carolina, early Sunday, along the state’s border with Virginia, according to the preliminary report from the US Geological Survey. 
   
      It’s the strongest quake to shake the state since 1926, according to the North Carolina Geological Survey.
   
      The quake, whose epicenter is in Alleghany County, was felt as far away as Washington D.C. and Atlanta, according to reports to the USGS. 
   
      It struck about 8:07 a.m. ET. 
   
      Alleghany County Sheriff Bryan Maines was getting ready for church when “stuff started falling off of the wall,” he said. The house appeared to shift, and it felt like it might fall down, he told CNN. 
   
      “Started getting some sheet rock damage. My chimney was starting to crack,” he said. “Several houses with structure damage. We have folks out right now. There are houses that have shifted 1 or 2 inches off their foundation. There are folks who have had to leave their homes because it’s not safe inside. It’s a pretty big event.” 
   
      There were no immediate reports of injuries, but there is damage in the town of about 1,800 people, Sparta Mayor Wes Brinegar said, adding that the foundation of his home cracked and items fell from shelves inside his home. 
   
      “It felt like a big locomotive going by and a big wave coming underneath the bed,” the mayor said. “I’ve lived here my whole life and have never felt anything like that.”
   
      The USGS says earthquakes become destructive at a magnitude of 4.0 to 5.0, depending on variables. A 5.3-magnitude is considered a moderate quake, the USGS says. 
   
      The agency issued a green alert, meaning there is a low likelihood of casualties and damage. 
   
      Town Councilman Cole Edwards, too, was jolted awake by the quake, he said. There was no damage to his home, but it broke some dishes and knocked some pictures off of the wall, he said. 
   
      “We’ve had a lot of scared folks this morning,” the mayor said. “That was the most intense one we’ve ever had.”
   
      The earthquake rumbled at a depth of about 5.7 miles, which is considered a shallow quake. Quakes shallower than 43 miles tend to be more destructive than deeper ones, the USGS says.
   
      This marks North Carolina’s strongest earthquake since a 5.2-magnitude struck Mitchell County, about 50 miles northeast of Asheville, on July 8, 1926, the North Carolina Geological Survey says. A 5.5-magnitude shook Skyland in 1916, the agency said. 
   
      Sparta is about 100 miles north of Charlotte. A Charlotte firefighters union tweeted there were no reports of injuries. 
   
      “Good Morning Charlotte, we are sure most of you are awake because yes, that was an earthquake you felt. No local reports of damage or injuries but what a wake up call,” the union tweeted.
   
      Sheriff Maines’ deputies are making sure they’re “highly visible right now,” he said. 
   
      “With the pandemic going on, people have higher anxiety right now. One of the biggest things for law enforcement right now is to calm the waters, for people to live in peace and not be in fear right now,” he said. “We live in a small mountain community. We all plan on taking care of each other.”
   
      The Sparta area sits among three seismic zones, in Charleston, South Carolina, eastern Tennessee and central Virginia. Several smaller quakes, all 2.6-magnitude or lower, rumbled near Sparta on Saturday and early Sunday. Two more temblors struck a few miles from Seymour, Tennessee, last weekend, the USGS says.  
   
A USGS impact map shows the agency received reports from people who felt the quake all along the eastern seaboard. The map shows clusters of reports more than 300 miles away, in Atlanta and in the nation’s capital. 
   
      “I felt my bed shaking ever so slightly, and I knew it was the unmistakable feel of an earthquake, but it was so subtle, I didn’t know if others might notice and I figured the origin had to be far away,” Limaya Atembina of Rockville, Maryland, told CNN in a Facebook message.

"Earthquake shakes Utah, rattling frayed coronavirus nerves",2020-03-19 00:03 UTC,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2020/03/18/earthquake-shakes-utah-rattling-frayed-coronavirus-nerves/TzfCxxG7Hr3kLrn3L37CfJ/story.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — A moderate earthquake Wednesday near Salt Lake City shut down a major air traffic hub, damaged a spire atop a temple and frightened millions of people already on edge from the coronavirus pandemic. There were no reports of injuries. The 5.7-magnitude quake just after 7 a.m. damaged the spire and statue atop the iconic Salt Lake Temple. Elsewhere, bricks were showered onto sidewalks and a chemical plume was released outside the city. The epicenter was just southwest of Salt Lake City, between the airport and Great Salt Lake. It was felt by about 2.8 million people who were already hunkered down inside their homes to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Many ran outside in panic amid the shaking that lasted as long as 15 seconds. Advertisement ‘‘This is extremely bad timing, because we already have the coronavirus issue going on right now causing a lot of anxiety,” Governor Gary Herbert said. Planes were diverted from Salt Lake City International Airport and the control tower and concourses were evacuated. Far fewer people than normal were in the airport, due to the coronavirus precautions. On a typical travel day, the airport would have had about 24,000 people inside and more making connections. But there were just 9,000 on Wednesday, making an evacuation easier. airport executive director Bill Wyatt said. No runway damage was found and most of the damage in the terminal appeared to be caused by a broken water line, Wyatt said. Cargo and non-commercial flights resumed hours later, but commercial flights were delayed into the afternoon. At Salt Lake Temple, the trumpet held by the Angel Moroni fell from the statue at the top of the temple and stones were displaced from the spire. The temple is undergoing renovations and a seismic upgrade. Construction crews were sent home while the damage was assessed, church spokesman Daniel Woodruff said in a statement.

A 5.7-magnitude earthquake shook Salt Lake City and its suburbs early Wednesday, sending spooked residents fleeing their homes, knocking out power for tens of thousands and closing the city's airport. The epicenter was just southwest of Salt Lake City and about 2.8 million in the state probably felt the quake, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. There were no initial reports of major damage to buildings or injuries, said Utah Emergency Management spokesman Joe Dougherty. Operations at Salt Lake City International Airport came to a halt and the control tower and concourses were evacuated, the airport tweeted. The quake also shut down the light rail service for Salt Lake City and its suburbs. Residents reported feeling shaking across a 100-mile (160 kilometer) area, with the heaviest impact in Salt Lake County, officials said. Some residents ran from their homes and into the streets as they felt the earthquake shake buildings for 10 to 15 seconds. The quake knocked pictures from walls and dishes from shelves, and people reported feeling it in the neighboring states of Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming and Nevada. Gov. Gary Herbert warned people to stay away from downtown Salt Lake City while officials assess damage. About 55,000 people lost electricity in the Salt Lake City area, said utility Rocky Mountain Power. The road to the Salt Lake International Airport was closed and officials asked people not to head to the airport. It was the largest earthquake to hit Utah since a 5.9 magnitude quake shook southern Utah in 1992, according to Utah Emergency Management. Most shaking was reported in the Salt Lake County area, near the epicenter in the Salt Lake City suburb of Magna but the quake was felt 80 miles away (130 kilometers) in the Utah city of Logan.

Kansas Sierra Club looks for solutions after Hutchinson earthquake,2020-01-21 00:17 UTC,https://www.ksnt.com/capitol-bureau/kansas-sierra-club-looks-for-solutions-after-hutchinson-earthquake/,"KSNT 27 News Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.     TOPEKA, Kan. (KSNT) – A Kansas environmental group said the Hutchinson earthquake is just another example of the increasing trend of stronger earthquakes in the state. The Kansas Sierra Club lobbies to lawmakers on all issues that could affect the environment. It said something needs to be done about the earthquakes. The United States Geological Survey shows that the number of magnitude 3.0 or greater earthquakes in the central part of the country has jumped to more than 300 in 2017. The average used to be 25 from 1973-2008. The Sierra Club points to the oil and gas industry with fracking and injecting water underground. “If these are man-made earthquakes and they’re caused by an industry or industries, then we need to do something about it, because Kansans, whether it’s their homes and businesses, are feeling these earthquakes, and property’s getting damaged, and taxpayers having to pick up the bill,” said Zack Pistora, legislative director for the Kansas Sierra Club. The U.S.G.S. said fracking and wastewater removal can be linked to earthquakes, but it’s not always the case. Pistora said the group will continue to work throughout the legislative session for stronger restrictions to prevent earthquakes. “These are issues that Kansans need protection on,” Pistora said. He said the Sierra Club has introduced bills in the past that would address these issues that haven’t gotten the attention he believes they deserve. Restrictions could focus on the location of fracking and the amount that would be allowed. They could come from the Kansas Corporation Commission. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

Another earthquake hits Puerto Rico,2020-01-11 20:39 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/11/us/puerto-rico-earthquake/index.html,"
      An 5.9 magnitude earthquake rattled Puerto Rico on Saturday, fueling anxiety among residents and sending them running in terror.
   
      The quake was about 8 miles south of Indios in the Caribbean Sea, the US Geological Survey said, at a depth of 6.2 miles. The USGS first said the preliminary magnitude was 6.0.
    
      Puerto Rico has been beset by temblors throughout the week, including a 6.4 magnitude quake Tuesday that killed at least one man, destroyed homes and left most of the island without power. A 5.2 magnitude aftershock struck on Friday afternoon.
   
      As of Saturday afternoon, about 59,000 customers remain without power, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority officials said. 
   
      The earthquake renewed fear and anxiety among residents in the southern towns of the island. 
   
      As the ground shook on Saturday, people at Mercedita International Airport in Ponce quickly ran outside the terminal, and a few miles away, parts of the roof and facade of a historic building collapsed.
   A post shared by Maria Santana (@msantananyc) 
      Luis Emanuelli, who owns a restaurant in the building, said that while the interior was not damaged, he and his team decided pick up a few documents, some equipment and close indefinitely.
   
      “We don’t know what we are exposed to,” he said.
   
      The US territory was expecting power to return by Saturday to its 3 million residents, and authorities had tweeted that it was 95% restored a couple of hours before Saturday’s quake at about 8 a.m. ET.
   
      Parts of Lares, Adjuntas, Ponce and San German lost electrical service after the new quake. After the tremor, power was on to about 93% of the island, PREPA said.
   
      Amid the earthquakes, Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced signed a major disaster declaration on Saturday, asking the federal government for additional federal aid for the southern towns of Guanica, Guayanilla, Peñuelas, Ponce and Yauco.
   
      The governor told reporters there is an estimated $110 million in damage caused by the quakes.
   
      Earlier this week, Vázquez Garced had declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard.
   
      She warned businesses against price gouging after saying there have been reports of tent prices rising.
   
      “I urge those people to have sensitivity. We want to assure the well-being of people who lost their property, don’t have a roof and are choosing to sleep in a park and need at least an awning to cover themselves from the sun and rain,” the governor said in Spanish.
   
      Thousands of families have fled their homes, fearing the structures may collapse during an aftershock. They are sleeping in mattresses, tents and tarps set up in stadiums, fields and next to highways. 
   
      A baseball stadium in Guayanilla as well as public parks and schools across the southern towns have become massive shelters in the past days. Scores of people are sleeping in cots under large white tents and dozens of portable bathroom have been set up.
   
      More than 6,000 people were staying in shelters, Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, the territory’s nonvoting delegate to Congress, said.
   
      Since December 28, about 500 earthquakes of magnitude 2.0 or higher have hit Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017.
   
      That storm killed almost 3,000 people, and left millions of Americans without power, water or shelter. Recovery has been slow and hard.
   
      Airbnb’s Open Homes program is offering free, temporary housing in Puerto Rico, its site says.
   
      “Relief workers, neighbors who’ve had to evacuate, and others impacted by the event” are eligible to book rooms at no cost, Airbnb says. “If you’ve been displaced or are helping with relief efforts, you can book free accommodations between January 9, 2020 and January 31, 2020.”
   
      Residents can also donate space for those in need of temporary housing.

      A magnitude 4.0 earthquake lightly shook the Los Angeles area early Thursday, striking in the ocean off coastal Southern California.
   
      The quake began at 2:13 a.m. PT, centered in the Pacific Ocean about 15 miles south of Port Hueneme, a city roughly 60 miles west of downtown Los Angeles, the US Geological Survey says.
   
      The quake produced light to weak shaking, the USGS says. 
   
      It felt like a quick jolt in Los Angeles-area communities such as West Hollywood, Marina del Rey and South Gate, people told CNN affiliate KABC.
   
      No damage or injuries were immediately reported.

 An earthquake of magnitude 5.8 shook northeastern Iran Thursday, but there was little damage and no casualties, state television reported. The quake was centered on an area near Sangan, a town of about 10,000 people near the border with Afghanistan, at a shallow depth of 8 km (5 miles). “Our near-final report is that about 14 villages have had very limited damage,” Morteza Salimi, head of rescue at Iran's Red Crescent, told the television. “There are no casualties and most of the damage is walls collapsing in places where livestock is kept,” he added. Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Iran is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 quake in southeastern Kerman province killed 31,000 people and flattened the ancient city of Bam. "

Powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake hits between Cuba and Jamaica,2020-01-28 20:03 UTC,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/01/28/world/powerful-77-magnitude-earthquake-hits-between-cuba-jamaica/,"HAVANA (AP) — A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday, shaking a vast area from Mexico to Florida and beyond, but there were no reports of casualties or heavy damage.   Dr. Enrique Arango Arias, head of Cuba’s National Seismological Service, told state media that there had been no serious damage or injuries reported. Advertisement Gov. Carlos Joaquín González of Mexico’s Quintana Roo, which is home to Cancun, Tulum and other popular beach resorts, said the earthquake was felt in multiple parts of the low-lying Caribbean state but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.  The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize, but issued a later message saying the danger had passed.  The initial tremor was followed by a series of strong aftershocks, including one measured at magnitude 6.1.  The quake was felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Roman Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. ‘‘It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,'’ she told The Associated Press.  It was also felt a little farther east at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the southeastern coast of the island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages, said J. Overton, a spokesman for the installation, which has a total population of about 6,000 people.  Advertisement Several South Florida buildings were evacuated as a precaution, according to city of Miami and Miami-Dade County officials. No injuries or road closures were reported. No shaking was felt at the Hard Rock stadium in Miami Gardens, which will host the Super Bowl on Sunday.  The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper.  The islands experience so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said.  “It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,” Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.”  Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she saw manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage.  Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway.  “It felt to me like I was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,” he said.  Advertisement He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica.  The USGS initially reported the magnitude at 7.3.

The shaking was felt all the way in Southern California. FRESNO, Calif. -- A preliminary magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the eastern part of Central California Wednesday morning, according to the USGS. The temblor was reported in the Owens Valley, south of the town of Lone Pine on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  Residents across Central California reported feeling the quake, as did people in some parts of Northern and Southern California. Waves were felt in the Los Angeles basin, 200 miles away from the epicenter. Clovis resident, Ashley Rios, shared a photo with us of a crack in the tile of her home caused by the earthquake. Footage from a grocery store in Lone Pine showed a mess - cans were strewn on the floor and broken glass was everywhere. Lone Pine sits in a gigantic trough between two ranges of the Sierra Nevadas. It is here in the Owens Valley that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power aqueduct is situated to supply mountain water to Los Angeles. LADWP said engineers are examining the dams and waterways following the quake. So far, there have been no reports of damage. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said that the Owens Valley quake is in the same location that a M 4.6 quake was felt two nights ago. That smaller, earlier quake is now considered a foreshock to Wednesday's quake. Wednesday's quake sent hearts racing in Ridgecrest, where a flurry of shocks, as strong as 7.1, hit last year around the Fourth of July. ""This is a different fault than the Ridgecrest earthquake, and it's far enough away that it doesn't fall within the traditional definition of aftershocks. Rather, we would look at it as its own earthquake,"" Jones said. In the minutes after the magnitude 5.8 earthquake, there were more than a half a dozen aftershocks, ranging from M 2.5 up to M 4.6. As for the statistical chance of a greater earthquake in the area, Jones said with every quake, there is a 5% chance of something bigger.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A 5.4-magnitude earthquake hit near southern Puerto Rico on Saturday, briefly knocking out power and jolting many from their beds on an island where some people still remain in shelters from previous quakes earlier this year. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit at a shallow depth of 5.6 miles (nine kilometers) near the city of Ponce and the towns of Guanica and Guayanilla, where hundreds of homes were destroyed by a quake in early January that killed one person and caused millions of dollars in damage. Reports of damage were still trickling in on Saturday, with at least one second-story balcony crashing in the southern city of Ponce, spokeswoman Inés Rivera told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, cracks in homes were reported in Guayanilla. ""Everything shook really hard,"" spokesman Danny Hernández said by phone. Meanwhile, in Guánica, Mayor Santos Seda told the AP that no major damage has been reported so far, but noted that between five to 10 people remain in a shelter since the 6.4-magnitude quake that hit in January. ""Thank God everyone is OK,"" he said. ""The infrastructure is already weak."" Several aftershocks hit Puerto Rico's southern region, including a 4.9-magnitude one. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico's Seismic Network, said in a phone interview that while it's understandable many people are afraid and surprised by the most recent earthquake, it's not unusual given the seismic activity that began in the region in late December. ""In the long run, it's decreasing, but you can have peaks,"" he said, adding that he expects strong aftershocks to continue. The earthquake struck as Puerto Ricans are ordered to remain home as part of a two-month lockdown to help curb coronavirus cases. Gov. Wanda Vázquez tweeted that rescue crews were fanning out across the area and that she would shortly be traveling there to meet with those affected in person. ""If your infrastructure is damaged, you must leave with your face mask on and your emergency backpack,"" she said as she urged people to remain calm. But nerves are already frayed in many parts of the island as Puerto Rico continues to recover from Hurricane Maria, a string of strong earthquakes and the coronavirus. Silvestre Alicea, a 67-year-old man who moved back to Puerto Rico from New York upon retiring, lost his home in January's earthquake and is still living with his sister in Guanica. ""This is unreal,"" he said, adding that some neighbors have left the area to stay with relatives elsewhere and that many, including a security guard who worked all night, are now sitting nervously in their balconies. ""He hasn't slept.""

LA DWP replacing 7000 miles of water pipes in Los Angeles with earthquake resilient pipes; water will keep flowing after the shaking stops,2020-12-02 02:53 UTC,https://abc7.com/la-dwp-replacing-miles-of-water-pipes-to-help-in-case-of-quakes/8426107/,"WATCH LIVE LADWP is replacing critical areas along its 7,000 miles of water pipeline with earthquake resilient ones ones to help keep the water flowing after a big one hits. LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Local utilities are looking for new ways to make Southern California earthquake safe, and one way is by replacing aging water pipes. The new pipes could help keep the water flowing after a big one hits. LADWP is replacing critical areas along its 7,000 miles of water pipes in Los Angeles with earthquake resilient pipes to ensure water is still flowing after the shaking stops. ""We live in earthquake country. The Northridge earthquake is another reminder for us to make sure that we develop an infrastructure that is resilient where we can bounce back and provide reliable water supplies to our customers after a large earthquake event,"" said Alvin Bautista of LADWP. RELATED | How to make your own earthquake kit  LADWP joined Japan's earthquake resilient pipe network in 2013, making L.A. the United States' first public utility system to use the earthquake resilient pipe. It involves a stronger steel pipe coating and a joint that doesn't crack during shaking. ""Our regular pipe does not have this type of freedom of movement, so the material that we use has it, so it will allow for a certain amount of expansion and contraction, it also gives it a degree of freedom where it can rotate along the axis there so that it doesn't break with excessive movement underground,"" said Bautista. LADWP's long-term replacement plan will take years to complete; targeted locations in critical earthquake hazard zones were first to receive the earthquake resilient pipe. ""Areas where we need reliable water supply such as hospitals, command and control centers, shelters, areas where people will gather after a large earthquake event, those areas need to be reliable with the water supply, that's our focus,"" said Bautista. Drivers around L.A. will notice construction zones where crews are installing the earthquake resilient pipe. After the replacement is done and the traffic inconvenience is over, L.A. will have the sturdiest water pipes in America.

According to the National Earthquake Information Center, California generally gets two or three earthquakes with a magnitude of 5.5 and higher every year.
These earthquakes are considered large enough to cause moderate damage to buildings and infrastructure in the state.
The strongest earthquake to hit the state on record measured 7.9 in magnitude and hit near Fort Tejon in 1857, leaving a surface rupture scar over 217 miles in length along the San Andreas fault.

New funds for earthquake retrofitting are available for California residents in high-risk zones. State officials announced that $13.2 million will be offered to 4,400 applicants in grants of $3,000 each. There are 1.2 million families who live in high seismic-hazard areas. For the first time, homeowners in cities including Palo Alto, Lancaster, Oxnard, Palm Springs and Fremont are eligible to apply for grants. Last year David Beilfuss of Pasadena described himself as ""house rich and cash poor."" Still, he decided to sign up for a grant from the Earthquake Brace + Bolt program out of fear of becoming homeless. ""My wife and I knew that even with earthquake insurance we needed to do more to protect our family, our home and our investment,"" he said. Homes that were constructed before 1980 and especially before 1940 are particularly vulnerable to being toppled off their foundations. State officials say that critical retrofitting involves bolting the house to the ground and installing plywood bracing known as cripple walls. The major earthquakes in Northridge, Napa and Loma Prieta left homes in ruins. ""I saw the devastation. I saw the disruption to homeowners after the Napa earthquake, houses that came off of their foundation not yet reoccupied two years after the earthquake,"" says Janiele Maffei, chief mitigation officer with the California Earthquake Authority.

5.1 magnitude earthquake rocks North Carolina,2020-08-09 13:09 UTC,https://www.wxii12.com/article/51-magnitude-quake-rocks-north-carolina/33555174,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. The most powerful earthquake to hit North Carolina in more than 100 years shook much of the state early Sunday, rattling homes, businesses and residents.  There were no reports of serious injuries, but some minor structural damage was reported in Sparta, as well as cracks in roads. Images on social media also showed items knocked off of grocery store shelves. The U.S. Geological Survey said on its website that there are chances for more aftershocks in the next week, forecasting a 45% chance for earthquakes of magnitude 3 or greater. The chances of another quake as strong as the one on Sunday or greater was about 1%, the geological survey said. Allegheny County, which includes Sparta, declared a state of emergency Sunday afternoon. Michael Hull was standing in his driveway at his home in Sparta when he noticed a group of deer running. “Not even a minute passed and the side-to-side motion started,” Hull said. “It takes you a minute to realize what’s happening, and you just can’t believe it. Then it was over. It was loud, like God was shaking a mountain at you, literally.” Karen Backer was in her Greensboro apartment when she heard initially mistook banging in her kitchen for her roommate. “Nope, it was the cabinet doors ‘clinking’ open and closed! My neighbors on the other hand said they felt our apartment building shaking,” Backer said. “Well, sadly, nothing surprises me in 2020, but a hurricane and an earthquake in the same week is crazy.” It was the largest earthquake to hit the state since 1916, when a magnitude 5.5 quake occurred near Skyland, the weather service said. The quake’s epicenter was about 2.5 miles (four kilometers) southeast of Sparta, just south of the Virginia-North Carolina border, the geological survey said. The USGS said the population in the affected region resides in structures “that are resistant to earthquake shaking, though vulnerable structures exist.” The quake was felt in nearby states including Virginia, South Carolina and Tennessee.

5.8 magnitude Central California earthquake felt in Bay Area,2020-06-24 19:27 UTC,https://abc7news.com/weather/58-magnitude-central-calif-quake-felt-in-bay-area/6264780/,"WATCH LIVE A 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck Wednesday morning in Central California. The shaking was felt all the way in Southern California. FRESNO, Calif. -- A preliminary magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the eastern part of Central California Wednesday morning, according to the USGS. The temblor was reported in the Owens Valley, south of the town of Lone Pine on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  Residents across Central California reported feeling the quake, as did people in some parts of Northern and Southern California. Waves were felt in the Los Angeles basin, 200 miles away from the epicenter. Clovis resident, Ashley Rios, shared a photo with us of a crack in the tile of her home caused by the earthquake. Footage from a grocery store in Lone Pine showed a mess - cans were strewn on the floor and broken glass was everywhere. Lone Pine sits in a gigantic trough between two ranges of the Sierra Nevadas. It is here in the Owens Valley that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power aqueduct is situated to supply mountain water to Los Angeles. LADWP said engineers are examining the dams and waterways following the quake. So far, there have been no reports of damage. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said that the Owens Valley quake is in the same location that a M 4.6 quake was felt two nights ago. That smaller, earlier quake is now considered a foreshock to Wednesday's quake. Wednesday's quake sent hearts racing in Ridgecrest, where a flurry of shocks, as strong as 7.1, hit last year around the Fourth of July. ""This is a different fault than the Ridgecrest earthquake, and it's far enough away that it doesn't fall within the traditional definition of aftershocks. Rather, we would look at it as its own earthquake,"" Jones said. In the minutes after the magnitude 5.8 earthquake, there were more than a half a dozen aftershocks, ranging from M 2.5 up to M 4.6. As for the statistical chance of a greater earthquake in the area, Jones said with every quake, there is a 5% chance of something bigger.

         MIAMI (CBSMiami) -- A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake has struck south of Cuba and northwest of Jamaica, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It was centered 77.6 miles north-northwest of Lucea, Jamaica. It's not immediately clear if there are damage or injuries . It was centered only about 6 miles beneath the surface of the water. The quake was so powerful that some people in Miami say they felt their building shake. ""I was sitting at my desk in Aventura, I felt motion similar to feeling light-headed,"" said one person who felt his building shake, but didn't want to be identified.  He told CBSMiami.com, ""It didn't stop, and my coworker asked if the building was moving.  It lasted for another 20 seconds as we walked toward the stairwell."" There are buildings in downtown Miami being evacuated as well, reportedly due to the buildings shaking from the earthquake. Manny Garcia, who works in the Brickell area says, ""We felt a little rumble. I was on the 23rd floor. I definitely felt it.""  Chopper 4 flew over the buildings as hundreds of people were seen walking out onto the street.  Many condo residents and hotel guests near Kendall Drive and the Palmetto Expressway evacuated their buildings. Virginia Arellano had been on the 18th floor of her building, ""I felt a little shake in my chair."" ""We felt movement and everyone in the office said, 'what's happening, what's happening.' The blinds were moving and we were told to evacuate,"" Arellano said. Ferencz Horvath said, ""Once we walked outside the hall, we saw more people that were out there."" ""So it wasn't just us that felt it. This is real. So, we went down the stairs and we walked 19 floors, Horvath added. The Stephen P. Clark building in downtown Miami was closed as a precaution, according to Miami-Dade Police. Miami Police tweeted that some buildings in the Brickell area were evacuated but there were no reported injuries and there are no road closures.  anvplayer video=""4424272"" station=""CBS Miami""]   Raquel Perez, an employee at the Don Soffer Clinical Research Center on the UM Medical Campus was on the 7th floor when she felt the quake. ""Not everyone noticed it in my office. I was sitting at my desk and felt my chair swaying. Then, I noticed the cords of our window blinds swaying back and forth. It didn't look like it was windy outside, so I couldn't figure out why the building was swaying, but it was,"" said Perez.  ""It actually made me a little dizzy. Ten minutes later, someone in our office said they also felt movement and found a report online of an earthquake,"" she added. The University of Miami Miller School of Medicine sent a statement, ""We are aware of the earthquake that occurred this afternoon south of Cuba. There has been no impact, and no buildings have been evacuated, on the University of Miami Health System and Miller School of Medicine campus. All operations continue on normal schedules.""    ""It is the plate boundary between the Caribbean plate and the North American plate, the fault, the main boundary is moving relative to the two plates at a speed of 2 centimeters per year,"" explained University of Miami Prof. Falk Amelung, who teaches in department of marine geosciences. ""So every 200 years you get a strong earthquake."" The National Weather Service has issued a tsunami threat for the coasts of Jamaica, Belize, Cuba, Honduras, Mexico and the Cayman Islands. The Weather Service said there is a threat of tsunami waves reaching about 1 to 3 feet above tide level. There are no initial reports of damage or casualties.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

          / KCAL News
         LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — A coalition of Hollywood stakeholders are speaking out against a plan to develop two skyscrapers after recent geological studies showed earthquake-causing fault lines running through the proposed site. A letter from the California Geological Survey last week to LA's planning department said scientists found multiple fault lines capable of causing an earthquake where the development – named the Hollywood Center – is planned. ""These studies strongly support the presence of an active southern fault strand entering the eastern Hollywood Center property in the vicinity of the alley at Argyle,'' the letter said. The letter also said the U.S. Geological Survey's own peer-reviewed analysis of the Hollywood Fault zone in the immediate area of the proposed development showed near-surface fault traces of the Hollywood Fault in the same locations. The USGS study showed four fault projections that run through the area, with some going directly through the planned sites. Attorneys for the Stop the Millennium Hollywood Coalition said they believe the most recent environmental reports that developer Millennium Partners submitted to Los Angeles planning staff left out critical data related to possible earthquakes. ""We have much more evidence, in fact bombshell evidence, that the project site ... is riddled with earthquake faults,'' said Robert Silverstein, the attorney for the Stop the Millennium Hollywood. ""If Los Angeles City Hall has any integrity, it will listen to the preeminent United States Geological Survey and California Geological Survey and not approve Millennium's dangerous new proposal.''  The plans for the development include a 46-story building to the west of the iconic Capitol Records building and a 35-story structure to the east. It also includes two other, 11-story buildings. Altogether, the development would include 1,005 residential units and up to 30,176 square feet of commercial use space within the four mixed-use buildings, according to the LA planning department.

         ALBANY, N.Y. (CBSNewYork/AP) — New York has deployed 25 state building inspectors and 26 bilingual mental health professionals to assist with earthquake recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday. Democrat Cuomo said Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul is leading a delegation to earthquake affected areas as a follow-up to initial damage assessments conducted by the governor two weeks ago. ""This is an ongoing situation. The tremors have not stopped. The damage has not stopped. People have not yet been able to go back to their homes because you have tremors and earthquakes that are continuing,"" Cuomo said.  The ground in southwest Puerto Rico has been shaking since Dec. 28, toppling homes and schools. Cuomo said thousands of people remain in shelters, unsure if their homes are structurally safe and fearful of the ongoing tremors. The earthquakes struck as Puerto Rico was still recovering from extensive damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, Cuomo said. (© Copyright 2019 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

'The bed was shaking': Delaware man living in Puerto Rico recounts biggest earthquake in century,2020-01-08 22:04 UTC,https://6abc.com/del-man-living-in-puerto-rico-recounts-biggest-quake-in-century/5827185/,"WATCH LIVE Del. man living in Puerto Rico recounts biggest quake in century. Sarah Bloomquist has more on Action News at 4 p.m. on January 8, 2020. WILMINGTON, Delaware (WPVI) -- Cars, cots and plastic chairs became temporary beds for hundreds of families who lost their homes in southwest Puerto Rico as a flurry of earthquakes struck the island, one of them the strongest in a century. The magnitude 6.4 quake that struck before dawn on Tuesday killed one person, injured nine others and knocked out power across the U.S. territory. More than  250,000 Puerto Ricans remained without water on Wednesday and another half a million without power, which also affected telecommunications. The hardest hit municipality was the southwest coastal town of Guánica. More than 200 people had taken shelter in a gymnasium after a quake on Monday, only for the latest shake to damage that structure - forcing them to sleep outside. Kevin Melloy divides his time between Delaware and Puerto Rico where he owns an art gallery. He was waking up very early Tuesday morning when the strong earthquake struck. ""The bed was shaking and I heard this really, really loud, really intense - which was the earthquake - just the seismic activity I guess, it was just everything outside was shaking. And within seconds all the dogs in the neighborhood started barking and then it just went click and all the electric went out."" Melloy flew home to Delaware hours after the quake. He plans to return to Puerto Rico in February. He says the people there are very resilient, but, right now, they need help. Tuesday's quake was the strongest to hit Puerto Rico since October 1918, when a magnitude 7.3 quake struck near the island's northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people. -- The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Seismologists say it's impossible to predict when the quakes will stop or whether they will get stronger.

Hundreds of people sat in the streets of the city, some cooking food on barbeque grills, afraid to return home for fear of structural damage and aftershocks.  A tsunami alert was issued for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after the initial quake, but was later canceled. Albert Rodríguez, who is from the southwest town of Guánica, said the tsunami sirens went off before officials canceled the alert.

6.5-magnitude earthquake strikes Puerto Rico early Tuesday morning amid heavy seismic activity,2020-01-07 09:35 UTC,https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/political/national/6-5-quake-strikes-puerto-rico-early-tuesday-morning-amid-heavy-seismic-activity,"Menu SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck Puerto Rico before dawn on Tuesday, and was followed three hours later by an aftershock measuring 6.0. They are the largest in a series of quakes that have struck the U.S. territory in recent days and caused heavy damage in some areas. Eight people were injured in the city of Ponce, near the epicenter of the quake, Mayor Mayita Meléndez told WAPA television. Puerto Rico’s power authority said on Twitter that one of the country’s main power plants, which sits near the epicenter, had been damaged, but officials expect to restore power to the island later Tuesday.  A tsunami alert was issued for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after the initial quake, but was later canceled. Albert Rodríguez, who is from the southwest town of Guánica, said the tsunami sirens went off before officials canceled the alert. He said there is widespread damage in his neighborhood. “The road is cracked in the middle and it lifted up,” he said. The mayor of Guayanilla, Nelson Torres, told NotiUno radio station that the church in the public plaza of his town collapsed. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, told The Associated Press that it is hard to obtain reports of damage or injuries because communications are down for much of the island. He said officials in Ponce told him there was widespread damage. “We expect that this will be the largest quake for now,” he said. “The aftershocks will continue for some time.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Wanda Vasquez, told station Radioisla just before 6 a.m. that there had been no immediate reports of deaths. She ordered government offices closed for the day and urged citizens to remain calm and not check damage to their homes until daylight. A 5.8-magnitude quake that struck early Monday morning collapsed five homes in the southwest coastal town of Guánica and heavily damaged dozens of others. It also caused small landslides and power outages. The quake was followed by a string of smaller temblors. The shake collapsed a coastal rock formation that had formed a sort of rounded window, Punta Ventana, that was a popular tourist draw in the southwest town of Guayanilla. Residents in the south of the island have been terrified to go into their homes for fear that another quake will bring buildings down.  He said the quakes overall come as the North American plate and the Caribbean plate squeeze Puerto Rico.

A 4.2-magnitude earthquake hit the Pacoima area early Thursday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A 4.2-magnitude earthquake hit the Pacoima area early Thursday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.  A strong shaking was felt across the San Fernando Valley region as well as across Los Angeles. It was followed by a 3.3 aftershock a few minutes later.   Caltech said 60 aftershocks have been recorded. According to a USGS map, the shaking was felt over an area stretching from Palmdale to Anaheim, and from Ontario to Agoura Hills. Caltech Staff Seismologist Dr. Jen Andrews said Thursday's temblor occurred near the area of the 6.7-magnitude San Fernando earthquake in 1971, and the 6.7-magnitude Northridge earthquake in 1994. ""It's not possible for us to say today's event is related to those, but it's not surprising that we're having seismicity in this area,"" Andrews said. ""We've got a number of fault signs nearby, including the Sierra Madre fault sign ... as well as the Mission Hills and Northridge Hills faults.""   ABC7's David Ono was at home when his dogs ""started barking and running before I felt anything."" ""It was a very light rumble for just a few seconds, then a really sharp jolt and that was it,"" Ono said. ABC7 entertainment guru George Pennacchio said he too was alerted by his dog. ""I really do feel that dogs feel them first, because she was up on her feet, because I was still awake when that aftershock hit,"" Pennacchio said. ""So it was a little bit jarring."" There were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries due to the quake. Surveillance cameras at San Fernando restaurant Magaly's Tamales recorded the early morning shaking, showing some pans being knocked over and boxes shaking. Seismologist Lucy Jones described the earthquake and its aftershocks as ""garden variety California quakes,"" noting that they occurred ""in an area with lots of faults and both the 1994 Northridge and 1971 Sylmar quakes."" ABC7's George Pennacchio reacts to 'jarring' 4.2 earthquake centered in Pacoima  ""The good (ordinary) life of the Golden State,"" she mused in a tweet. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it ""concluded the systematic survey of the City of Los Angeles by ground and air"" and reported no major infrastructure damage or serious injury due to the quake.

Magnitude 7.7 earthquake hits between Cuba and Jamaica,2020-01-28 19:32 UTC,https://www.lex18.com/media/v/content/3666c9ed40bea298b1147d9456eb8230,"Menu HAVANA (AP) — A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday, shaking a vast area from Mexico to Florida and beyond, but there were no reports of casualties or heavy damage.   Dr. Enrique Arango Arias, head of Cuba's National Seismological Service, told state media that there had been no serious damage or injuries reported on the island. The Cayman Islands were rocked by several of the strong aftershocks that followed in the area, including one measured at magnitude 6.1. Water was cut off to much of Grand Cayman Island, and public schools were canceled for Wednesday  Gov. Carlos Joaquín González of Mexico’s Quintana Roo state, which is home to Cancun, Tulum and other popular beach resorts, said the earthquake was felt in multiple parts of the low-lying Caribbean state but there were no reports of damage or injuries.  The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize, but issued a later message saying the danger had passed.  The quake was felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Roman Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. ""It felt very strong but it doesn't look like anything happened,'' she told The Associated Press.  It was also felt a little farther east at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the southeastern coast of the island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages, said J. Overton, a spokesman for the installation, which has a total population of about 6,000 people.  Several South Florida buildings were evacuated as a precaution, according to city of Miami and Miami-Dade County officials. No injuries or road closures were reported. No shaking was felt at the Hard Rock stadium in Miami Gardens, which will host the Super Bowl on Sunday.  In the Cayman Islands, the quake left cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no reports of injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper.  The islands experience so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said.  “It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,” Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.”  Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said he saw manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage.  Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway.  “It felt to me like I was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,” he said.  He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica.  Mexico’s National Seismological Service reported that the quake was felt in five states including as far away as Veracruz, on the country’s Gulf Coast.  _____ Associated Press writer Kate Chappell in Kingston, Jamaica, contributed to this report.

6.7-magnitude earthquake hits Turkey,2020-01-25 02:03 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/24/europe/turkey-quake-intl/index.html,"
      At least 36 people died and more than 1,607 have been hospitalized in eastern Turkey after an earthquake rattled the region on Friday evening, according to state broadcaster TRT Haber.
   
      The 6.7-magnitude quake struck near the town of Sivrice, in eastern Elazig province, causing at least 10 buildings to collapse,  Interior Minister Sulyman Soylu said.
   
      Eighteen people were killed in Elazig province and four in Malatya, said Soylu at a news conference on Saturday. 
   
      At least 45 people have been rescued from collapsed buildings, AFAD said, adding that 1,521 buildings have been inspected, with 76 found to be collapsed and 645 heavily damaged.
   
      Some 1,243 people were wounded following the powerful quake, most of them in Elazig province, according to a statement published by Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD). 
   
      Video from Turkey’s IHA Broadcasting Services shows emergency crews rescuing injured people from a collapsed building. 
   
      The earthquake caused five buildings to collapse in Elazig, and heavy damage to a number of buildings in the area, Minister of Environment and Urbanization Murat Kurum told reporters.
   
      Preliminary reports say the earthquake lasted 40 seconds, AFAD said, adding that 3,699 search and rescue personnel have been deployed.
   
      Fifteen aftershocks have been felt in the wake, with the strongest registering at 5.4 magnitude, Soylu said. The quake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 10 km (6 miles), according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which enhances the shaking felt at the surface. 
   
      About 500,000 people felt strong to very strong shaking, the USGS reported. The earthquake was felt in several other countries, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
   
      The quake interrupted a live broadcast of Edessa TV. Video of the broadcast shows four anchors talking while everything shakes around them.
   
      All relevant departments were taking measures to ensure the safety of citizens following the earthquake, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Saturday. Interior, health and environment ministers were sent to the quake-hit area.

SISAK, Croatia — A bishop asked Catholics to fast and pray for two days Wednesday after an earthquake struck Croatia. Bishop Vlado Košić of Sisak issued the appeal to Catholics in his diocese and throughout the country after a magnitude 6.4 earthquake on Dec. 29 that killed at least seven people and injured 26 others.  His diocese includes the town of Petrinja, located close to the epicenter of the quake, which was felt in the neighboring countries of Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Hungary, as well as Austria and Italy. In a statement reported Dec. 30 by Croatia’s Catholic Information Agency, the bishop called for prayer and fasting Dec. 30-31 that residents would be spared further suffering. He said that many people had been left homeless and feared aftershocks.  “We lost the cathedral and about a dozen other churches, not counting the chapels, which were destroyed by the earthquake, and many were severely damaged,” he said.  “We pray for the strength to endure all this faithfully and that in this tragedy we all remain brave and in solidarity.” Among those killed in the earthquake was a 12-year-old girl. Another victim was discovered in the rubble at a church in the village of Žažina. Local media reported that the man was the church’s organist. An estimated 86% of Croatia’s four million-strong population is Catholic. At Wednesday’s general audience, Pope Francis prayed for the victims of the earthquake.  “I hope that the authorities of the country, with the help of the international community, will soon be able to alleviate the suffering of the dear Croatian people.” The Pastoral Directorate for Croats Abroad has urged members of the Croatian diaspora to send aid via Caritas Croatia. ‘I myself, along with parishioners from the parish, have worked to remove people from under the rubble.’ In response to the earthquake, the patriarchs of and heads of churches in Syria demand the lifting of ‘unjust sanctions,’ calling for ‘exceptional measures’ to secure delivery of humanitarian aid. Among the many victims, the body of Father Imad Daher, a priest of the Greek Melkite Catholic Parish of Our Lady, was found under the rubble — after many hours of searching for the priest. More than 300 people died in the earthquake, Italy’s deadliest since 1980. TV Picks 04.23.23  For me, my aunt epitomized what it meant to be intentional, authentic and faithful.

EAST FREEHOLD, N.J. (WPVI) -- The United States Geological Survey reports a magnitude 3.1 earthquake hit near Freehold, New Jersey early Wednesday morning. The earthquake, which began around 2 a.m., is not reported to have caused any serious damage or injuries. Several social media users across the state reported feeling vibrations, some even thought there was an explosion.  The USGS said the earthquake was centered 1.25 miles south, southeast of the center of East Freehold. The 2 a.m. temblor was felt ""in much of central New Jersey,"" according to the National Weather Service.  Shaking and loud bangs were reported, but no injuries or immediately known damage. Social media, mostly from central New Jersey residents, reported they thought something hit the house or a low flying plane. The earthquake, although small, is also relatively uncommon in the region. A 2.7 earthquake was reported in Bernardsville, New Jersey in 2015. The Greater Delaware Valley region felt tremors after a 4.1 magnitude quake struck near Dover, Delaware back in December 2017. And on Aug 23, 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake in central Virginia shook buildings in the tri-state area.

"3.1 magnitude earthquake reported in Monmouth County, N.J.",2020-09-09 06:57 UTC,https://6abc.com/31-magnitude-earthquake-reported-in-monmouth-county-nj/6415086/,"WATCH LIVE No injuries or major damage have been reported from a 3.1 magnitude earthquake. EAST FREEHOLD, N.J. (WPVI) -- No injuries or major damage have been reported from a 3.1 magnitude earthquake felt in Freehold, New Jersey on Wednesday morning. But the tremors were enough to wake people in the middle of the night, flooding the Monmouth County 911 Center with calls. In surveillance video outside the center, you can just barely see the camera shake during the quake, which began around 2 a.m., but people near the epicenter definitely felt it. ""My husband thought it was a gas main explosion or something like that,"" said Jennifer Gerstenberg of Freehold.  ""When I woke up, my friend called me and said that she felt an earthquake and stuff fell off of her shelf,"" said sixth-grade Sarah Gerstenberg. ""Our operators actually in our 911 center located just across the way has experienced what they describe as a jet engine kind of explosion,"" said Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden. Within 30 minutes of the 3.1 magnitude earthquake, the Monmouth County 911 Center received around 125 calls.  ""I heard something,"" said one worried caller. ""Like your house shook? Yeah. So did half the state I guess,"" answered the dispatcher.  Some were asking if an explosion had happened.  ""Our whole building just shook. And a big boom happened,"" one caller said. ""Just get yourself into a safe place, OK? We're not sure what it was, but we do have officers out investigating the area, OK?"" the dispatcher replied. Researchers at Princeton University are spent the day looking at data collected from campus, 30 miles from the epicenter.  ""This is just part of the normal process of the earth's cycle of plate tectonics. The slow building up stress and a sudden release of elastic energy,"" said Frederik Simons, professor of seismology at Princeton University. He said these small earthquakes are normal, we just don't feel them very often. ""Feeling one in New Jersey is extremely rare,"" said Simons. Professor Simons estimated this earthquake could be felt within a radius of 30-50 miles from Freehold. The earthquake, although small, is also relatively uncommon in the region. A 2.7 earthquake was reported in Bernardsville, New Jersey in 2015. The Greater Delaware Valley region felt tremors after a 4.1 magnitude quake struck near Dover, Delaware back in December 2017. And on Aug 23, 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake in central Virginia shook buildings in the tri-state area.

""According to our forecast, over the next 1 Week there is a 4% chance of one or more aftershocks that are larger than magnitude 5.1. It is likely that there will be smaller earthquakes over the next 1 Week, with ... magnitude 3 or higher aftershocks.

A decade after earthquake that devastated Haiti,2020-01-12 16:21 UTC,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/01/12/a-decade-after-earthquake-that-devastated-haiti/,"Calvin Hughes, Anchor   Calvin Hughes, Anchor PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti – Sunday marks 10 years since a massive earthquake rocked Haiti, killing hundreds of thousands of people. Local 10 News anchor Calvin Hughes was in Haiti right after the historic earthquake and is back a decade later. The country is still feeling the effects and struggling to recover, even after all these years have passed. The deadly quake was the country’s darkest day, and the new normal still includes daily desperation. Some Haitians have tried to make the best of the situation while still recovering from the earthquake. Some schools that collapsed have reopened, as well as some government buildings. Haiti’s president, Jovenel Moïse, told Hughes he will be addressing the nation on Sunday to discuss the future. Moïse also urges unity among Haitians in the country like the days following the quake. The president stated that there is so much the nation is struggling with, like high inflation, high gas prices and a hunger crisis. For the past 18 months, violent, deadly protests that last for weeks at a time have shut down daily life. The protesters accused Moïse of taking money, and not delivering on a contract from a multi-billion dollar government fund designed for social programs. Haitians in Miami’s Little Haiti neighborhood had a silent march to commemorate and reflect on the devasting day. Johanne St. Leger lost her uncle and father in the earthquake and had been grieving silently for nearly 10 years. “I think it is helpful to be able to share this day with everyone here, I’m sure, whether it’s someone close to them that they’ve lost or just here for support,” said St. Leger.

Magnitude 6.3 earthquake strikes Croatia; 5 deaths reported,2020-12-29 16:44 UTC,https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2020/12/29/magnitude-63-earthquake-strikes-croatia-5-deaths-reported/,"PETRINJA, Croatia (AP) — A strong earthquake in Croatia destroyed buildings and killed at least seven people Tuesday southwest of the capital, displacing scores of area residents or making them afraid to sleep indoors as emergency teams searched for those still missing by nightfall.  Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. Another six people were killed in nearly destroyed villages close to the town, according to HRT state television. At least 26 people were hospitalized, six with serious injuries, officials said, adding that many more people remained unaccounted for. In Petrinja, cries could be heard from underneath destroyed houses. One woman was found alive some four hours after the quake. Emergency teams used rescue dogs in the search for survivors, while family members looked on in despair. “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT. “This is like Hiroshima - half of the city no longer exists.” Firefighters worked to remove the debris from a collapsed building that fell on a car. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the vehicle and carried into an ambulance. The town was left without electricity or running water as officials scrambled to set up temporary accommodation for all of the displaced residents in need. Residents fearing another earthquake seemed poised to spend the night outside their homes. Petrinja resident Marica Pavlovic said the quake felt “worse than a war.” “It was horrible, a shock. You don’t know what to do, whether to run out or hide somewhere,” she told The Associated Press. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable,” Plenkovic said. He said the army has 500 places ready in barracks to house people, while others will be accommodated in nearby hotels and other places. “No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” the prime minister said. Officials also toured a damaged hospital in the nearby town of Sisak, which was also badly hit. Plenkovic said the patients will be evacuated in army helicopters and ambulances. Health officials said a baby was delivered in a tent in front of the hospital in the aftermath of the earthquake. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that she spoke with Plenkovic and instructed an envoy to travel to Croatia as soon as possible. As a Mediterranean country, Croatia is prone to earthquakes, but not big ones. The last strong quake struck in the 1990s when the picturesque Adriatic coast village of Ston was destroyed. The Croatian military was deployed in the quake-hit region to help with the rescue operation. Croatian seismologist Kresimir Kuk described the earthquake as “extremely strong,” far stronger than another one that hit Zagreb and nearby areas in the spring. He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky old buildings and move to newer areas of the city because of aftershocks. In the capital, people ran into the streets in fear. The earthquake was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia and Slovenia. It was felt as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported. Authorities in Slovenia said the Krsko nuclear power plant was temporarily shut down following the earthquake. The power plant is jointly owned by Slovenia and Croatia and located near their border. ___ AP writers Dusan Stojanovic and Jovana Gec in Belgrade, Serbia, contributed to this report.

Punta Ventana, which translates to ""Window Point,"" was a stone arch shaped like a round window located in Guayanilla along the southern coast. The rock formation was one of the island's most iconic treasures and major tourist attractions. A 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck the island on Monday, wiping out the natural structure. The UPRM Meteorological Laboratory shared a photo on Twitter of Punta Ventana before and after the earthquake, showing where the soaring arch once stood before its tragic collapse. ""The natural window disappears in Punta Ventana, Guayanilla,"" UPRM said. A colonial church constructed in 1841 also ""totally collapsed,"" during the earthquake, according to Yordan. Another earthquake, this one measuring 6.4, and several other strong tremors struck Puerto Rico on Tuesday, killing at least one man and injuring several others. Tuesday's quake -- the strongest and most damaging of a series of quakes that have hit the island since December 28 -- moved Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced to declare a state of emergency, activating the Puerto Rico National Guard. It’s likely the most damaging quake to impact the island since 1918.

Fire officials offer safety advice after earthquake hits Southern New England,2020-11-08 18:38 UTC,https://www.nwahomepage.com/news/fire-officials-offer-safety-advice-after-earthquake-hits-southern-new-england/,"KNWA FOX24 Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       EAST PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) — The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed Sunday morning that an earthquake hit near the coast of Southeastern Massachusetts.  The New Bedford Fire Department is advising anyone who felt the earthquake to check their gas lines, furnace and smokestack for potential damage and make sure they have a working carbon monoxide detector. “Not a lot of people are using their heat right now, and that’s our fear,” Deputy Fire Chief James Fortin said. “Our fear is that once it starts getting colder, our first cold snap, people are going to have damage that they’re not aware of, they’re going to kick on their heat, and we’re going to have multiple carbon monoxide incidents.” If you spot any loose pipes or fallen bricks, contact your gas company or the non-emergency line of your local fire department.  The USGS originally estimated the earthquake was 4.0 to 4.2 magnitude. Dr. John Ebel, a research scientist at Weston Observatory, said the magnitude of the quake can change once inspections are conducted. He pegged it at 3.6 before the USGS updated its estimation. Earthquakes of that magnitude occur in New England roughly once a year, Ebel said, but they’re often in locations where they go unnoticed by the general public.  There’s a possibility of aftershocks over the next few days, according to Ebel, but they will likely be weaker than the initial quake and the tremors may not be felt by everyone. Earthquakes of 3-4 magnitude are typically not damaging, though there were some reports of structural damage in New Bedford and Dartmouth. The Red Cross was seen visiting homes where damage was reported.  Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

"Earthquake felt in Massachusetts, Rhode Island",2020-11-08 16:23 UTC,https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2020/11/08/earthquake-felt-in-massachusetts-rhode-island/,"BOSTON (AP) — The strongest earthquake to hit southern New England in decades rattled homes and nerves Sunday morning, but didn’t cause any significant damage, authorities said. The 3.6 magnitude earthquake centered off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts, in Buzzards Bay struck just after 9 a.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Earthquake Information Center. The earthquake hit at a depth of a little more than 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) and was felt across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and into Connecticut and Long Island, New York. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a magnitude 3.5 temblor hit in March 1976, said Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist. About 14,000 people went to the agency’s website to report the earthquake, including people from Easthampton, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut, both about 100 miles (160 kilometers) away, and several from more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) away in Boston, he said. That’s not unusual in New England. “It’s common for them to be felt very far away because the rock here is old and continuous and transmits the energy a long way,” Caruso said. Ali Kenner Brodsky, who lives in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, not far from the epicenter, was sitting in her kitchen talking with her son, when it hit. “It was a rumbling. It sounded like something exploded. It rumbled. The whole house shook,” she said. She said it lasted around 10 to 15 seconds. “In that moment, it feels like it’s going on forever.” Her husband, Sam, ran to the basement because he thought the boiler blew up. Magnitude 3.6 earthquakes rarely cause major damage, Caruso said. Chris Besse, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said it had not received any reports of injuries or significant damage. Later Sunday, Besse in an email said there were reports of some structural damage to buildings in New Bedford, and urged anyone who felt the earthquake to check for such damage. The Red Cross tweeted that it was helping 21 people, including children, who had been displaced from their New Bedford homes. There were other reports of minor damage. Police in Fall River tweeted that they received numerous phone calls about the quake, including reports of items falling off of shelves, and street signs getting uprooted. ___ Associated Press reporter Michelle Smith in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.

Feds order Anderson Reservoir be drained to allow necessary earthquake retrofitting,2020-02-25 07:39 UTC,https://abc7news.com/feds-order-south-bay-reservoir-be-drained-due-to-earthquake-risk/5965376/,"WATCH LIVE Federal dam regulators are ordering the biggest reservoir in Santa Clara County to be drained because of earthquake risk. MORGAN HILL, Calif. (KGO) -- Federal dam regulators are ordering the biggest reservoir in Santa Clara County to be drained because of earthquake risk. The Anderson Reservoir sits between Morgan Hill and San Jose, located just east of Highway 101. For years, Valley Water has led the push to rebuild the Anderson Dam. However, plans have been met by obstacles.  In a release to ABC7 News, Valley Water described the Anderson Dam Seismic Retrofit Project (ADSRP) as both ""complicated and time-consuming."" Valley Water CEO Norma Camacho added, ""Valley Water has been working with several state and federal agencies through the years to secure the proper permits as the scope of the project has increased due to additional safety and design requirements, while also complying with federal statutes and regulations, including the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and Clean Water Act."" According to Valley Water's website dedicated to the project, the status is ""on target,"" and ADSRP is in the ""planning"" phase. In a letter written by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Division of Dam Safety and Inspections Director, David Capka said, ""Until full remediation is completed, the dam safety risk at this project is unacceptably high."" The letter to Christopher Hakes, the Deputy Operating Officer of Valley Water's Dam Safety and Capital Delivery Division continued, ""Your actions to date do not demonstrate an appropriate sense of urgency regarding the interim conditions at the project."" FERC ordered the reservoir to be drained, by Oct. 1, so work can start. Residents in the surrounding community are also demanding action. ""I never saw any work done during the day,"" Morgan Hill resident, Manuel Orozco said. ""It made me a little skeptical, wondering okay... that's what we're paying $500 million for."" According to Matt Keller with Valley Water, the latest project estimate puts the cost at $563 million. Keller explained a parcel tax, approved by voters in 2012 will cover $65 million, and much of the money will come from increased water rates. The fear in all of this is that a powerful earthquake could damage the dam, and send a wall of water into surrounding communities. While Valley Water publicly agreed with the need to move quickly, it shared concern about unsafe consequences. Camacho's statement included, ""With the draining of the reservoir, experts would expect fish die-offs. The inability to keep a consistent flow in Coyote Creek downstream of the dam year-round would significantly impact sensitive native fish, amphibians, reptiles, wetlands, and riparian habitats. Water quality could also be significantly impacted downstream of the dam.""  Morgan Hill resident Suzy Buck told ABC7 News, ""I know it won't be forever. I know it'll just be for a little while until they remedy the situation. But until then, I think wildlife has a way of surviving no matter what."" Valley Water's top concern is potential damage to the intake structure. According to Camacho, this would leave the district without any control over water flowing out of the reservoir. Ultimately, impacting communities downstream. The potential areas of impact include parts of San Jose which were inundated in the historic floods of February 2017. Back then, water from the Anderson Reservoir flowed over the banks of Coyote Creek and into several communities. ""It affected a lot of people that were living near the creeks,"" San Jose resident, Habibullah Norzaie said. ""And personally, because I'm a student at San Jose State, I saw lots of flooding along the roads and the streets."" Camacho's statement explained, ""Anderson Reservoir is currently operating below the current levels required by FERC and the state Division of Safety of Dams."" ""A priority will be to design and build a large outlet pipe, which will provide greater control over the water levels and increase public safety,"" she continued. Camacho said Valley Water staff is already exploring other sources of water that will have to come from outside of the county. ""While residents have done an excellent job of conserving water since 2013, another drought during this timeframe could require everyone to significantly decrease their water use,"" Camacho warned. A bill has been introduced in the California Legislature to help expedite the regulatory process and move the project along as quickly as possible.

"Volunteers with Springfield's Convoy of Hope, American Red Cross assisting Puerto Rico earthquake victims",2020-02-17 16:14 UTC,https://www.ky3.com/content/news/Volunteers-with-Springfields-Convoy-of-Hope-American-Red-Cross-assisting-Puerto-Rico-earthquake-victims-567943481.html,"More than a month after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck Puerto Rico, volunteers and staff from Springfield are still assisting victims.   Both Springfield's Convoy of Hope and the American Red Cross have staffed the hardest hit areas after the earthquake. The large earthquake on January 7, and many smaller ones have caused a lot of damage, especially in the southwest part of Puerto Rico. Springfield resident Nixie Sorrells was there in late December when the first of the earthquakes hit. ""We felt the first one, and then after that were aftershocks, but it was not strong,"" Sorrells says. She's lived in Puerto Rico all her life, until moving to Springfield last year. On January 7th, she was back in Springfield. ""It was kind of feeling guilty, because we were here and they were there,"" Sorrells says. Her family's homes are ok, but she has friends who have lost their homes and knows many people who still fear another big earthquake. ""They put the mattress and everything outside the houses to sleep there, because they were afraid of the ceiling coming down and killing them,"" Sorrells says. Convoy of Hope staff and volunteers have been in Puerto Rico since a few days after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. They originally distributed supplies like food and water. Sorrells says, ""We were like without power for more than 3 months and without water for almost the same."" Convoy of Hope transitioned about a year-and-a-half ago to rebuilding. They've adopted a couple of communities that were hit hard by the hurricane and are helping rebuild homes.  Because they already have a presence in Puerto Rico, they were able to quickly respond to the earthquakes and continue to provide for the needs of people in both disasters. Just recently, the board decided to make the US territory one of its permanent locations. ""What it means now is we are able to direct more resources there, we're able to make longer-term plans. Rather than say, hey will keep helping till the money runs out, now we can say, we are budgeting this on an ongoing basis, so we are going to continue to provide help,"" said Jeff Nene, national spokesman for Convoy of Hope. Some of the supplies they're providing now include blankets, hygiene items, solar lanterns and tents."

No major injuries were reported, Puerto Rico Director of Emergency Management Carlos Acevedo said. He said some homes were damaged in Guanica, and a home collapsed in Guayanilla. Some victims of the earthquake posted photos of deep cracks in walls. There were also reports of rock slides along Route 2, Acevedo said. No tsunami warning was issued after the quake. But geologists warn of more tremors to come. ""More earthquakes than usual (called aftershocks) will continue to occur near the mainshock,"" the USGS said. ""When there are more earthquakes, the chance of a large earthquake is greater which means that the chance of damage is greater."" The agency advised anyone in or near vulnerable structures to be extra cautious and said those caught in potential quakes should drop, cover and hold on.

Strong Aegean Sea earthquake topples buildings in Turkey,2020-10-30 12:44 UTC,https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2020/10/30/66-magnitude-earthquake-in-aegean-sea-shakes-western-turkey/,"ISTANBUL (AP) — A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 19 people and injuring over 700 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 17 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, including one who drowned, and 709 were injured, according to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Among the dead were the wife and two children of the secretary-general of the Turkish Medical Association’s Izmir branch, the group said. On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying “Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children.” At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall and cranes lifted concrete slabs from the wreckage.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul’s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey’s largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter — roughly 10 kilometers — potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 3,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens. France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France’s “full solidarity with Greece and Turkey” and said “we are ready to offer the necessary aid.” The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. Some islanders planned to spend the night in emergency tents for fear of aftershocks. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. “We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,” Turkey’s Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. “This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We’re ready to help if Greece needs it.” Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, tweeted that he had phoned Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together.” Erdogan responded to the tweet with his thanks and offered his condolences. “Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,” he wrote. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and NATO allies. —- Becatoros reported from Athens.

"Earthquake strikes New Jersey, shaking reported across state",2020-09-09 09:02 UTC,https://www.knopnews2.com/2020/09/09/earthquake-strikes-new-jersey-shaking-reported-across-state/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A magnitude 3.1 earthquake struck in East Freehold, New Jersey, early Wednesday morning, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Residents took to social media to express their shock at the rare occurrence. Hundreds of people as far away as Philadelphia and Long Island, New York, contributed to the USGS' “Did You Feel It?” map, reporting only weak or light shaking and no damage. “It would be very surprising for us to see anything more than you know, damaged shelves or picture frames falling off of windows,” said Robert Sanders, a geophysicist with the survey.  The USGS said the earthquake happened about 2 a.m. and was centered 1.25 miles (2 kilometers) south, southeast of the center of East Freehold, about 3 miles deep. “That’s a fairly uncommon event magnitude for quakes in this area,” Sanders said. Since 1970, there have been two other quakes within 10 miles of this location, a 3.5 in 1979 and a 3.1 in 1992, he said. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved."

Houston Middle School condemned due to earthquake damage,2020-09-17 20:19 UTC,https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2020/09/17/houston-middle-school-condemned-due-to-earthquake-damage/,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) -Houston Middle School has been condemned as a health and fire hazard. Matanuska-Susitna Borough assembly members approved the condemnation 6-1 with George McKee voting against it. The building has been closed since Nov. 30, 2018 after an earthquake caused catastrophic damage. Capital Projects Director Jude Bilafer told the assembly the borough contracted an architectural firm to do “destructive analysis” on the building. “We found significantly more damage than anyone anticipated or found,” Bilafer said.  Last year the Mat-Su School Board approved a plan to replace the two-story classroom wing that took the brunt of the damage and repair the administrative wing and gym. Jeff Walden, the project management division supervisor, said trying to fix the building would only have brought it about 60% up to code. “We went ahead and designed those repairs but when it came time to estimate what it would cost to actually do the repairs we discovered it was more cost effective to tear it down and start over,” Walden said. With the extensive damage the contractors found, the borough estimates it will now cost $34.9 million to tear down and replace the entire facility. There is currently about $25 million in funding approved for the project, about $15 million of which came from insurance money, the borough’s finance director, Cheyenne Heindel, told the assembly.  Bilafer asked the assembly to condemn the building, which could make it easier to get federal funds.  “It is in the best interest, the safety, the health of everyone surrounding Houston Middle School, be it inside the school as students, faculty or parents, or even the construction workers, to start from ground zero on this building,” Bilafer said. Middle school students have been moved into the high school building and portable classrooms since school resumed after the earthquake. The Mat-Su Borough will put out advertisements to hire a demolition company. Over the winter they’ll finish the design phase. Walden expects construction to take about one year. Copyright 2020 KTUU.

Community members reflect on Haiti service 10 years after tragic earthquake,2020-02-21 04:01 UTC,https://www.texomashomepage.com/news/local-news/community-members-reflect-on-haiti-service-10-years-after-tragic-earthquake/,"Texomashomepage.com Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       WICHITA FALLS (KFDX/KJTL) — This weekend marks exactly 10 years since an incredible group of doctors and nurses from North Texas left for Haiti along with local spiritual healers with the goal to bring at least some relief to victims of the Jan. 12, 2010 catastrophic 7.0 earthquake. People there were desperate for help, and KFDX’s very own Darrell Franklin was fortunate enough to see for himself and report back to Texomans on how the North Texas Medical Mission tried to help as many of those victims as possible in a short period of time. A decade later, he talked with some of those members of the relief team about this mission they will never forget. By the time the North Texas Medical Mission arrived on the earthquake-ravaged island in late February 2010, the Haitian government was estimating a death toll of 230,000 people. Dr. Jerry Myers left a week ahead of the group to try to work out logistics, and there were problems from the beginning. “The night before we were flying the group in, we didn’t know if the airport was going to open,” Myers said. “I knew we could not come across the border because they would confiscate everything we were bringing in. We kind of bribed our way through the airport”  Several members of the mission team were shocked by the devastation that surrounded them. “One of the things that first impressed me on that first day was driving through all the ruins and then coming upon what we call shantytowns or tent cities, which literally you could smell before you saw them,” Dr. Robert McBroom said. “We’d pass by. They had a whole line of porta-potties outside the tent cities. Every one of them was flooding over into the gutters.  One of McBroom’s first patients was a child. “I had to rely on interpreters to try to get at what he was complaining of,” McBroom said. “Mostly it was dehydration and diarrhea. That little kid was drinking out of the gutter.” McBroom said the little boy was drinking where wild hogs, chickens and livestock were. “Not to mention their own excreta,” McBroom recalled. “We were in a situation where there’s still bodies beneath the rubble,” Myers said. “When we went to Port au Prince and when we went through there, there were people just walking around the rubble, knowing that their family’s still in there and even in the area we were at. There were still people in the rubble. They hadn’t gotten out bodies. It was a very difficult situation.”  Another member on the team, Dr. Dan Bolin, said one of his first patients he attended to was a little girl a few days old who he took to a Red Cross tent. “I’m not a pediatrician, but I saw this little girl,” Bolin said. “Of course, I knew she was gonna die if we didn’t… The baby was 9-days-old and under, probably had a low birth weight, probably was premature, dehydrated, lethargic. That is one of the most, you know, distinct memories I have. I hope that little girl survived.”   Some of the people they spoke with recalled the terrifying moments during the earthquake when the ground was shaking. How the houses fell and how people were under rubble for days on end. The team would examine or treat up to 600 people a day, and one reason there were such long lines seeking help could have been because Pastor Kile Bateman was part of the team. “Before I knew it, I had a microphone in my hand, and I got to speak some Creole, get everybody all excited,” Bateman said. “Then they said, ‘tell them why you’re here,’ so we shared that we have a medical team here. I didn’t know exactly how to tell them about the location, but they interpreted that. And that’s how a lot of people heard that there were going to be doctors, nurses, healers that were going to be coming, so they began to spread the word.”  Pastor Patti Bateman said she remembers what he said to children during that time. “Well, mostly I would just use whatever Creole I have and know,” Bateman said. “Some of that is crazy songs and singing. Jesus loves the little children in Creole and our kids are both adopted from Haiti. We love Haiti. We love people. We love the country. We love the culture.”  From being in the streets to interacting with the residents, Bolin said the impact made during that time will be in his heart and mind forever. “I got the feeling they don’t laugh a lot there, but they laughed at some of us and some of the things you did,” Bolin said. “I think that was as much of a gift as anything is for them to laugh and show a positive spirit.” The devastation and medial issues the team witnessed were heartbreaking they said. “There was a lot of infection, a lot of abscesses, and obviously from injuries that weren’t taken care of from broken bones that were set,” Bolin said. “We had to regroup with those things. But these people have no medical care. I mean, I saw a lady with a blood pressure of 225 over I don’t know what. You know, we saw breast cancer in a 30-year-old, thyroid diseases that I didn’t even see in medical school.”  Lung infection. Pneumonia. Untreated asthma. Sickness from drinking soiled water. These doctors remember it all. For a week, this team hurt right along with their patients, but what would hurt the most was not knowing if their patients would get care and survive once they left the ravaged island.  “You took a terrible infrastructure and made it worse,” Myers said. “You kind of left realizing that it’s not going to get much better, but you feel like you’ve at least made a mark there.”  The energy and effort put in during that trip continuously play on their desire to serve. “What matters is that we make the effort,” McBroom said. “If we could give anybody five minutes of comfort with the type of services that we provided that week, then we will have accomplished our mission.”  “This is probably the last time we’re going to be together. This has been an incredible thing,” Bateman said in 2010.  It was indeed an incredible thing, Pastor Kile Bateman said. “They worked from early, early morning to when the sun went down,” Bateman said. “Hardly any breaks. Maybe a little bit of water or something to eat.”   Though it was tough and heartbreaking, those team members don’t regret a second of it. “I’ll have to say this was the best day in medicine I’ve ever had,” Dr. Tim McCleland said in 2010. “This has been an incredible thing,” Bateman said. “The only way you’re going to know what all you’ve done here is probably when you get to heaven and you get to see the impact you made here.”  It was an incredible mission accomplished where a North Texas medical and spiritual mission brought healing to Haiti.

"2 years later, 2 Eagle River schools are still on the mend from 2018 earthquake",2020-12-01 02:27 UTC,https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2020/12/01/2-years-later-2-eagle-river-schools-are-still-on-the-mend-from-2018-earthquake/," Much like the Anchorage School District schools, the quake affected each person and family differently. In all, over a dozen schools needed major repairs. Two schools in Eagle River, Gruening Middle School and Eagle River Elementary, were knocked offline and deemed unsafe. Two years later, on the anniversary of the earthquake, the two schools remain offline but their path to reopening looks bright. “Gruening is coming really good,” ASD Project Manager for Gruening Middle School Yuki Janson said. “Lots of cleaning and lots of surprises here and there but we’ve got really good contractors.” With the help of voters passing a school bond last April, the Anchorage School District quickly got to work this summer with the ambitious goal to have the school renovated and rebuilt by the fall of 2021. “It’s an 80s building,” Janson said. “So you can’t trust everything you see. You gotta get inside and look.” Despite a few snags within the old building and a delay in shipping of materials from the Lower 48 due to COVID-19, both schools are on track to open on time. “We’re pretty much on schedule,” ASD Project Manager for Eagle River Elementary Nick Bell said. “We’ve had delays in materials but the contractor is reworking their schedule in phasing in order to rework those delays and we are moving ahead. Making good progress.” “I would call it a repair and renovation,” ASD Senior Director of Capital Planning and Construction Tom Fenoseff said. “We’re repairing the structural issues, we’re making them safer and we’re adding some improvements to the schools like secure vestibules and improved security.” While the schools will still have some of their old features, they will also have the new school feel and look with technology, safety and structure upgrades. Eagle River Elementary is scheduled for completion in July 2021 and Gruening Middle School in early August 2021, both ready in time for the new school year. Copyright 2020 KTUU.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A 5.4-magnitude earthquake hit near southern Puerto Rico on Saturday, briefly knocking out power and jolting many from their beds on an island where some people still remain in shelters from previous quakes earlier this year. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit at a shallow depth of 5.6 miles (nine kilometers) near the city of Ponce and the towns of Guanica and Guayanilla, where hundreds of homes were destroyed by a quake in early January that killed one person and caused millions of dollars in damage.

The shaking was felt all the way in Southern California. FRESNO, Calif. -- A preliminary magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the eastern part of Central California Wednesday morning, according to the USGS. The temblor was reported in the Owens Valley, south of the town of Lone Pine on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  Residents across Central California reported feeling the quake, as did people in some parts of Northern and Southern California. Waves were felt in the Los Angeles basin, 200 miles away from the epicenter. Clovis resident, Ashley Rios, shared a photo with us of a crack in the tile of her home caused by the earthquake. Footage from a grocery store in Lone Pine showed a mess - cans were strewn on the floor and broken glass was everywhere. Lone Pine sits in a gigantic trough between two ranges of the Sierra Nevadas. It is here in the Owens Valley that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power aqueduct is situated to supply mountain water to Los Angeles. LADWP said engineers are examining the dams and waterways following the quake. So far, there have been no reports of damage. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said that the Owens Valley quake is in the same location that a M 4.6 quake was felt two nights ago. That smaller, earlier quake is now considered a foreshock to Wednesday's quake.  Wednesday's quake sent hearts racing in Ridgecrest, where a flurry of shocks, as strong as 7.1, hit last year around the Fourth of July. ""This is a different fault than the Ridgecrest earthquake, and it's far enough away that it doesn't fall within the traditional definition of aftershocks. Rather, we would look at it as its own earthquake,"" Jones said. In the minutes after the magnitude 5.8 earthquake, there were more than a half a dozen aftershocks, ranging from M 2.5 up to M 4.6. As for the statistical chance of a greater earthquake in the area, Jones said with every quake, there is a 5% chance of something bigger.

Video: Anderson Reservoir is drained as part of earthquake project to rebuild 240-foot Anderson Dam,2020-12-16 14:00 UTC,https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/12/16/video-anderson-reservoir-is-drained-as-part-of-earthquake-project-to-rebuild-240-foot-anderson-dam/,"Today's e-Edition Get Morning Report and other email newsletters  Get Morning Report and other email newsletters Today's e-Edition  Anderson Reservoir, the largest in Santa Clara County, is nearly empty. The Santa Clara Valley Water District, which owns the reservoir located east of Highway 101 between Morgan Hill and San Jose, said Tuesday that its crews have finished draining nearly all of its water — leaving it just 3% full — as part of a historic, $576 million earthquake repair job.  Draining began Oct. 1. Construction workers can now begin a 10-year seismic safety project to rebuild Anderson’s 240-foot earthen dam, which was built in 1950. The reservoir will remain nearly empty until 2024, water district officials said, while a 1,700-foot-long tunnel, up to 24 feet in diameter, is built on the north side of the dam. It is expected to increase by five-fold the rate at which water can be released during major storms or after an earthquake that could damage the dam. After that, the rest of the water will be drained out for six years, until about 2030 or 2031, while the dam is rebuilt to more modern standards. During that time, most of Anderson Lake County Park will be closed. Seismic problems at the dam were first identified 12 years ago. But the district’s delays in beginning the repair work prompted the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in February to order the reservoir drained. For the past three months, the massive lake was drained at the rate of about 200 acre feet, or 65 million gallons a day — the equivalent of 98 Olympic swimming pools every 24 hours. The water wasn’t wasted, however. Most of it went to drinking water treatment plants, and was served to the public, while some was percolated back into underground aquifers for storage, and some was released into Coyote Creek for fish. Federal regulators criticized the water district for taking so long to undertake the project. The agency first learned of the seismic problems in 2009, and subsequently released engineering studies showing that a 6.6 magnitude quake on the Calaveras Fault directly at Anderson Reservoir, or a 7.2 quake centered one mile away, could cause the reservoir’s huge earthen dam to slump and fail. Although the chances of that are extremely slim, if such a disaster had occurred when the reservoir was full, it could have sent a 35-foot wall of water into downtown Morgan Hill in 14 minutes. The waters would have been 8-feet deep in San Jose in three hours, potentially killing thousands of people. Ironically, on Tuesday morning, two earthquakes occurred 1 mile east of Anderson Reservoir on the Calaveras Fault — a magnitude 3.7 and 3.5. No damage was reported. Some local residents wondered whether the draining of the reservoir, which had been 18% full on Oct. 1, caused the earthquakes by shifting the amount of weight on the nearby fault. No, said federal geologists. Related Articles

“The recent earthquakes occurred along a known fault patch that typically has several similarly sized, naturally occurring earthquakes per year,” said Rob Skoumal, a research geophysicist, with the USGS Earthquake Science Center at Moffett Field. When full, Anderson Reservoir holds 89,278 acre feet of water — more than all other nine dams operated by the Santa Clara Valley Water District combined. The district, which serves 2 million people, will make up for the lost water during construction by pumping more local groundwater, using recycled water, and importing water from the Delta and from the Semitropic Water Storage District in Kern County, where it has been storing water underground for years.

The organization got its start more than two years ago as a way to raise money for Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Through community partnerships, they were able to raise around $400,000 at that time. Now, the group is hoping to have similar success with events like the radiothon. ""From A to Z I will say, from beginning to end we have seen volunteers, people from different organizations in the Hispanic community to come and really see what can be done, how we can come together to help Puerto Rico,"" said Camarada.

HAVANA -- A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday. Witnesses reported strong shaking but there was no immediate word of casualties or heavy damage.  The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago ""We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,"" she said. ""We heard the noise of everything moving around."" She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. ""It felt very strong but it doesn't look like anything happened,'' she told The Associated Press.  The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands see so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. ""'It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,""' Morales said. ""Then it continued and got more intense."" Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she had seen manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage. Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway. ""It felt to me like i was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,"" he said. He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica. The USGS initially reported the magnitude at 7.3.

Robert Putro was sleeping at his home in East Brunswick, N.J., about 2 a.m. Wednesday when he felt his house shake. He woke up to what he thought might be “a meteor hitting the atmosphere.”  The 3.1 magnitude tremor was felt by people and animals. It did not cause significant damage. About 30,000 tremors in that range occur globally every year. Putro said he has experienced other earthquakes. “This was like no other,"" he said of Wednesday’s. “It sounded like an explosion nearby, followed by shaking of my house.” More than 6,000 people responded to the USGS website to say they had felt it, with those nearest the epicenter reporting the strongest effects. The earthquake was felt throughout much of the state, including South Jersey and Philadelphia. Residents of Maryland, New York, and Connecticut also reported feeling seismic activity. USGS geophysicist Robert Sanders told NBC News that an earthquake in the region is “relatively uncommon.”  “It will take a few days or weeks before analysts can see if there’s a specific fault line at cause here,” Sanders said. He added that structural damage is unlikely. Damage most likely will be no worse than objects falling off shelves."

Buena Park Officials Join Annual Great ShakeOut Earthquake Drill,2020-10-16 08:57 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/buena-park-officials-join-annual-great-shakeout-earthquake-drill_3541354.html,"The city of Buena Park joined other regions throughout Orange County and the state of California by participating in the annual Great ShakeOut earthquake preparedness drill on Oct. 15.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of this year’s drills were held virtually, with organizers broadcasting the drill on Facebook Live. Orange County had 636,209 participants who registered for this year’s event, according to the Great California ShakeOut’s website, with the majority coming from K-12 schools, colleges, and universities. The state of California as a whole had 6.6 million participants. The drills in Buena Park were conducted at City Hall, the Public Works city yard, and the Buena Park Police Department. Gina Van Stratten, a marketing specialist for the city of Buena Park, told The Epoch Times that “each year that staff participates in this important drill we learn that earthquake preparedness is vital to safety at work.” “The more we practice, the more we become comfortable with the appropriate response. We are better prepared for when a big earthquake does strike,” Van Stratten said. She said the drill teaches people how to react to a potential emergency situation by using a “mock earthquake” for training. “Each staff member is made aware of the mock earthquake and then promptly stops, drops, and takes cover under their desk,” she said. “Staff is then told when the mock earthquake has ended, and then each staff member evacuates the building and gathers in their assigned areas in the front and back parking lots. Some staff members have preassigned duties to take a count of the staff in their department to be sure everyone is present and made it out of the building safely.” She added that “Buena Park puts staff and public safety first.” “We decide to participate so our staff remains safe during an earthquake emergency and then has the capacity to then go back to work and help the rest of the community after the earthquake emergency.” Doug Brodowski, operations manager at the Buena Park Public Works Department, told The Epoch Times that his department coordinated its earthquake response efforts with City Hall.  “We teach them to ‘drop, cover, and hold onto something’ in their present location. After 15 seconds we announced that the drill is completed. “Then we sound the fire alarms and all persons in the building then exited to the predetermined evacuation location outside the buildings where we take role and ensure that everyone safely exited the buildings.” The team then reports to its incident commander at City Hall, Brodowski said. “We then reported … via our emergency radio system that all persons are present and accounted for and that is the end of the drill. We do this periodically to remind our employees of earthquake safety and how to properly exit the building and then account for everyone. “It is a refresher on operating our radio system and reminds everyone of their designated role in these types of emergencies. For example, various employees are assigned and trained for search and rescue, first aid, etc.” The group behind the Great ShakeOut, the Southern California Earthquake Center, held a live-streamed video showcasing the online drill, which was held virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the drill, the center exhibited presentations from earthquake and emergency management experts who discussed how to be safe during an earthquake, then allowed users to ask questions. Ilyssa Plumer, the community preparedness officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Region 10, explained to the audience that a little bit of preparation before an earthquake strikes can have a big impact on how safe someone can be.  “It could be simple changes, like moving that tall bookshelf somewhere else that’s not near the couch where you sit and spend a lot of time, or actually reinforcing that top bookshelf into the wall so that if the ground starts shaking, it won’t fall over. You want to make sure you’re sitting and sleeping areas are clear from anything that could fall and injure you.” Brian Terbush, the earthquake/volcano program coordinator from the state of Washington’s Emergency Management Department, also discussed tips on how to stay safe. “In bed is actually statistically one of the safest places to be during an earthquake,” Terbush told viewers. “You just flip over and put your head over your [pillow] or put your pillow over your head, so you have a little bit of extra protection.” Althea Rizzo, the Geologic Hazards Program coordinator for Oregon Emergency Management, gave suggestions about what to do if a person is outside. “If you’re outdoors, you want to move to an open area and away from buildings, especially if you’re in a downtown area,” she said. “A lot of times, the facings of those buildings can fall away and cause injuries to people who are passing by. So you want to get down low and move as quickly as possible to an open area away from buildings.” The event also introduced a new smartphone app to viewers called “My Shake.” The app—which alerts each user when an earthquake occurs, depending on location—was implemented for this year’s drill so that participants would know that it was set up correctly and that they would be warned in the future. Officials recommended that Californians be prepared to be self-sufficient for 72 hours following an earthquake by having certain items handy, including a first-aid kit, food, and enough water for each member of a household to be able to drink a gallon a day for three days. The Great ShakeOut started in 2008 and had nearly 29 million registered participants worldwide this year, including over 12 million people in the United States.   Share this with everyone!"

This article may contain statements that reflect the opinion of the author
  The researchers said that if Gales Creek were to rupture today, it could cause powerful shaking and widespread damage in the Portland metropolitan area. They detailed their findings in the journalÂ Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America. Portland sits on the seismically active Cascadia subduction zone, the region of the Pacific Northwest where the Juan de Fuca plate bends and slides beneath the North American plate. Gales Creek lies within the Cascadia forearc, the land wedged between where the Juan de Fuca plate begins to bend and the line of Cascadia volcanoes in Washington and Oregon. Gales Creek runs 45 miles in a northwesterly direction in a forested area of the Coast Range mountains. Mapping and analyzing the fault is difficult as the lush vegetation buries evidence of past earthquakes, such as the cliff-like scarps that form when Earth’s crust breaks. They found thatÂ Gales CreekÂ potentially unleashedÂ a majorÂ earthquake 8,800 years ago, 4,200 years ago and 1,000 years ago. The fault may also have had ruptured before the first of those earthquakes and after the last one, but evidence for these events was weak.
All told, the researchers estimated that a major earthquakeÂ in Gales Creek happens every 4,000 years.Â If the entire fault were to slip today, they calculated that it could unleashÂ an earthquake of between magnitude 7.1 and magnitude 7.4, depending on the depth of the earthquake’s origin.
Nearby faults confound chances of major earthquake
While the next major earthquake isn’t likely to happen soon, the researchers noted that the actual risk of the entire fault rupturing is still subject to other factors, such as rupturing nearby faults.
“The linkage between rupture on the Gales Creek fault and neighboring faults is still unknown,” said lead author Alison Horst, who’s now with theÂ Division of Geology and Earth Resources at theÂ Washington State Department of Natural ResourcesÂ (WADNR).
The most recent earthquake along a similar fault was a magnitude 5.7 quakeÂ that hit March 1993 inÂ Scott Mills,Â Oregon. It caused damages totaling $30 million and was considered one of the largest recorded earthquakesÂ in the region.
The researchers saidÂ that other faults within the Oregon portion of the Cascadia forearc should be studied to assess past earthquakes. These faults, added Horst, are good areas of study because they’re near population centers. (Related:Â CatastrophicÂ earthquakeÂ overdue for California, geologists warn: Are you prepared yet?.)
Earlier this year, earthquake simulations from the WADNR showed thatÂ when a magnitude 9.0 earthquake strikes along Cascadia, it will generateÂ tsunami waves 10 feet or higher and flood the Washington coast. The initial wave will arrive in the coastal areas 10 to 15 minutes after the ground starts shaking, leaving little time for residents to seek high ground.
Cascadia produces a major earthquake every 300 to 600 years. The last time a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck along the fault was back in 1700.

"Turkey earthquake: More than 1,000 injured, 22 dead",2020-01-25 14:55 UTC,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/turkey-earthquake-injured-death-toll-2020-01-25/,"Watch CBS News 
January 25, 2020 / 9:55 AM
          / AP
         The death toll from a strong earthquake that rocked eastern Turkey climbed to 22 Saturday, with more than 1,000 people injured, officials said. Rescue workers were searching for people buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings in Elazig province and neighboring Malatya, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said.   Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, speaking at a televised news conference near the epicenter of the quake, said 39 people had been rescued from the rubble of collapsed buildings, including a woman recovered 14 hours after the main tremor.  Emergency workers and security forces distributed tents, beds and blankets as overnight temperatures dropped below freezing in the affected areas. Mosques, schools, sports halls and student dormitories were opened for hundreds who left their homes after the quake.  ""The earthquake was very severe, we desperately ran out (of our home),"" Emre Gocer told the state-run Anadolu news agency as he sheltered with his family at a sports hall in the town of Sivrice in Elazig. ""We don't have a safe place to stay right now.""   AFAD said it was followed by 228 aftershocks, the strongest with magnitudes 5.4 and 5.1.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Twitter overnight that all measures were being taken to ""ensure that the earthquake that occurred in Elazig and was felt in many provinces is overcome with the least amount of loss.""  Neighboring Greece, which is at odds with Turkey over maritime boundaries and gas exploitation rights, offered to send rescue crews should they be needed.  Turkey sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent. Two strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey in 1999, killing around 18,000 people.

In the first nightmarish hour after a massive earthquake devastated Haiti on Jan. 12, 2010, the Thomases were able to pull their sons Chilo and Jameson from the rubble. It took them hours more to find the then 2-year-old Rose-Berline. Her foot was crushed but she survived with help from a Cuban doctor. A French charity moved the Thomases to Canaan, a swiftly growing shantytown on empty land two hours from their destroyed home in the capital. Another non-governmental organization gave Rose-Berline a prosthetic lower leg and crutches. Then the Thomases and hundreds of thousands more Haitian earthquake survivors were left on their own. On the tenth anniversary of the Haitian quake, the Thomases live in a rotting two-room shack that floods when it rains in Canaan, which has become the largest slum in the Caribbean. Home to more than 300,000 people, Canaan has no running water, electricity or other public services despite repeated promises that NGOs, foreign governments and Haitian officials would help. Rose-Berline has outgrown her prosthesis and a pair of crutches provided by foreign aid workers. At 12, she runs the Thomas household while her mother works selling housewares in the street. The bone has grown out of her stump, making a new prosthesis impossible to fit, and the Thomases don’t have the money to pay for an operation. For observers, the fate of earthquake victims like Rose-Berline shows outside actors’ inability to follow through or make lasting positive change with the billions spent in Haiti after the earthquake, which killed hundreds of thousands and left more than a million homeless. The final death toll remains debated. “The international community was very efficient during three or four months to provide water, shelter in the form of tents and provisional shelters, provide medicine, food, etc.,” said Leslie Voltaire, a Haitian urban planner who has worked to improve conditions in Canaan. Asked about the long-term response, he offered a different evaluation. “It has been a disaster,” he said. ""All the displaced people are found in Canaan or other slums area. They don’t have real shelter. They have been building by themselves and without proper guidance by the state. If there is another earthquake it will crumble again.” Voltaire worked for the Haitian government housing agency after the quake and said he proposed a series of measures to improve conditions in Canaan, including road construction and the building of town centers with public services that would reduce inhabitants’ dependence on long commutes to Port-au-Prince. He said none of Haiti’s recent administrations had taken action. A housing agency spokesman told The Associated Press that he could not comment, and Haitian government representatives, including a spokesman for President Jovenel Moise, did not respond to requests for comment. As the tenth anniversary of the earthquake approached, many NGOs said they were deeply concerned about the conditions for quake survivors and the Haitian population overall. The organization Doctors Without Borders, for example, said efforts to strengthen Haiti’s hospitals, clinics and community medicine had been gravely neglected as global attention diverted from the country. “Most medical humanitarian actors have left the country and Haiti’s medical system is once again on the brink of collapse amid an escalating political and economic crisis,” Hassan Issa, the group’s head of mission in Haiti, said in an emailed statement. Marie-Mislen Thomas, 41, and her husband Sadilor, 48, a mason, took out a loan to pay for school for their five children. They had two more children after the quake and their ages now range from 4 to 14. But the couple used the money for basic needs like food last year as the Haitian economy slumped amid paralyzing political protests. Her children have spent months out of school, in the streets of Canaan. “My kids don’t go to school, they’re now playing with kids who are a bad influence. I am hoping that one day I can move my kids from this neighborhood, move them to something better,” Marie-Mislene said. As the oldest girl in the family, Rose-Berline cooks and cleans while her mother sells tablecloths and other goods nearby. Since her crutches are too small, the girl moves from room to room on her knees. “Rose-Berline is the mother of the house,” Marie-Mislene said. “Rose-Berline does everything in the house. She cooks, cleans, goes to the market to buy food.” Rose-Berline says her dream is to become a nurse. “I would love to help people in the future. I wish that my father could find work and help us finish school,” she said. “I hope I can do more when I grow up.” Other residents of Canaan are less hopeful about the future. Jean-Claude Jean, 50, was brought to Canaan by United Nations aid workers and lives in a plywood shack with sheet-metal roof. “They gave me a shelter for 3 years and said that it was only temporary. Now it’s 10 years later,” he said. He and his wife sell meat and poultry across from foul-smelling latrines, which are overflowing because they aren’t regularly emptied. A public school was built by an NGO in Canaan but is closed because there are no teachers to staff it. “’We have been left alone. No one ever said anything, no state presence, or the organization that brought us here,” Jean said. ___ Weissenstein reported from Havana.

         Guánica, Puerto Rico — A 5.8-magnitude quake hit Puerto Rico before dawn Monday, unleashing small landslides, causing power outages and severely cracking some homes. It was one of the strongest quakes yet to hit the U.S. territory that has been shaking for the past week. There were no immediate reports of casualties but there was significant damage in the town of Guánica. An Associated Press photographer captured an image of at least two vehicles crushed by a house that collapsed in the earthquake.   Residents took to social media to report the ""strong temblor.""  Triste despertar para familia que acaba de perder su casa a causa de el fuerte sismo que ocurrió hoy en el sur de Puerto Rico. Gracias a Dios estas personas y sus hijos están bien. pic.twitter.com/REcucvTuYY Power outages were reported in some parts of Puerto Rico following the quake, Angel Vazquez, emergency management director for the southern coastal city of Ponce, told The Associated Press. ""This is one of the strongest quakes to date since it started shaking on Dec. 28,"" he said. ""It lasted a long time."" Helicopters buzzed overhead as terrified residents jumped up from their folding chairs every time the earth shook, yelling at others to stay away from power lines. Few people dared go back inside their homes, but José Quiñones, 54, had no choice. His 80-year-old mother had heart problems and was lying in bed. Dozens of people in a neighborhood called Hope in the southwest town of Guánica walked around with their phones and yelled out the magnitude of the latest earthquakes as they tried to calm children who were forced to open their presents on Three Kings Day, a religious holiday, on streets and sidewalks. ""This is hell,"" said Alberto Rodríguez, 43, whose home collapsed on its side as the smell of gas filled the air. ""We haven't slept... you can't remain calm here. Guánica is no longer a safe place."" Less than a block away, Silvestre Alicea surveyed his home whose foundation collapsed on his bright blue 1977 Toyota Corolla, a prized possession. He jumped from his balcony as the home collapsed. Alicea had lived in New York for years until he retired to Guánica two years ago to live in the home he spent 15 years building. He doesn't have insurance. In this working class neighborhood, people shared soda and snacks as they sought shelter from a harsh sun, careful to stay away from homes whose columns and foundations were heavily cracked. At a hotel in the southwest coastal town of Guanica, people panicked as they tried to flee in their cars, only to realize that large boulders were obstructing the only highway heading north to the capital of San Juan, attorney Jose Francisco Benitez told the AP. ""There was a state of panic,"" he said. ""There were even people in their underwear walking around the hotel."" Many already had bags packed in their cars with a change of clothes, food, water and medicine.  Some like Noelia De Jesús, 69, and her husband, who uses a wheelchair, didn't know where they would spend the night. Government officials who inspected their home earlier in the morning said it was unsafe to live in and advised them to stay elsewhere. ""Everything broke, including the TV,"" she said. ""This is horrible."" Puerto Rico doesn't have a public earthquake warning system, except for sirens that are supposed to ring in case of a tsunami. Residents in this neighborhood criticized the government for what they believe is a lack of action. Dr. Sindia Alvarado, who lives in the southern coastal town of Penuelas, said she was petrified. ""My entire family woke up screaming,"" she said. ""I though the house was going to crack in half."" The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico's southern region began the night of Dec. 28, with quakes ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to 5.1. Previous quakes of lesser magnitudes in recent days have cracked homes and led to goods falling off supermarket shelves.  One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a 7.3-magnitude quake struck near the island's northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.

"3.1 Magnitude Earthquake In Freehold, New Jersey Felt By Approximately 6,900 People",2020-09-09 21:25 UTC,https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/09/09/3-1-magnitude-earthquake-in-freehold-new-jersey-felt-by-approximately-6900-people/,"Watch CBS News

         PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- If you were woken up in the middle of the night by the rocking of your bed, you are not alone. A magnitude 3.1 earthquake shook the northern half of New Jersey early Wednesday morning. While no damage or injuries were reported, it was a wild experience for many across the Mid-Atlantic. This morning's earthquake was a magnitude 3.1 tremor at a depth of 5 kilometers, or about 3 miles below the earth's surface. The tremor occurred about 1-1.5 miles outside of the town of Freehold. Did you feel it? 3.1M earthquake at Freehold, NJ overnight! Light shaking felt across NJ. Some weak shaking felt in Philly. Did you know, an East Coast earthquake can be felt over an area up to 10x larger than a similar magnitude earthquake on the West Coast? @CBSPhilly pic.twitter.com/4eLGmv7xv2 While the earthquake only lasted for about 13 seconds, it was enough time to scare folks across northern New Jersey and into parts of New York and Pennsylvania as well. While the number is unofficial, the USGS reports that over 6,900 people felt this morning's tremor. There were reports from as far away as the Hudson Valley and Cape May that claimed to have felt the tremor. The good news is that no damage or injuries were reported. According to the USGS, earthquakes that rate this low on the Richter Scale, usually do not cause property damage and most of the time will not cause any injuries. However, in these types of events, the injuries that do happen are usually caused by items falling off shelves and landing on people, rather than structural problems. When quakes move into the 5.0 or higher magnitude range, that is when property and structural damage typically happens. While the East Coast is definitely not known for its earthquakes, it does not mean that we do not feel them from time to time. In fact, this is the third quake to have its epicenter near Freehold since the 1970s. The most recent earthquake near Freehold was June of 1992, when a 3.1 magnitude quake hit. Before that, a 3.5 magnitude tremor occurred in 1979. On average, the urban corridor of New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Northern Delaware sees a smaller earthquake, like the one this morning, every two to three years. However, about one or two times a century a moderately strong earthquake will strike in the region. The last earthquake that was felt in the region and considered moderately strong -- 5.0-5.9 on the Richter Scale -- occurred in August 2011. Its epicenter was in Louisa, Virginia and rated as a 5.8 on the Richter Scale. That quake was felt as far north as Central Pennsylvania and the Delaware Valley even though we are over 200 miles from the epicenter.

         Boise, Idaho — A powerful earthquake struck north of Boise Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting that they felt shaking. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 6.5 temblor hit just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.  More than 2 million people live in the region who could have felt the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana and Salt Lake City, Utah. CBS Boise affiliate KBOI-TV says reports flooded its newsroom and popped up on social media from all over the Northwest and even Canada. Viewers said it lasted between 20-30 seconds. Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke's Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital shook but the quake didn't interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County, about 65 miles south of the epicenter, is on the front line of Idaho's coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation's highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. ""It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,"" he said.  The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. ""Until the next one, I guess,"" Smith said. ""I mean, that's what we do. We're all good."" Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it.  ""I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,"" Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. ""The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I'm sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating."" Greg Hogan, owner of Redwood Cabins in Stanley, told KBOI the quake took him and his 12-year-old son by surprise. ""It was like a heard of rhinos, rhinoceros were running through the house,"" Hogan said. ""My boy's looking at me with his eyes wide open and I just picked him up, grabbed him, and went outside until it settled down. It was a rattler."" "" … It was definitely jolting,"" he said. Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this strength every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay.  That quake was along what scientists call a ""normal fault"" and caused vertical movement, she said. Tuesday's quake appeared to be on an unmapped ""strike-slip fault,"" causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line.  ""This is one that wasn't obvious enough to be mapped before now,"" Jones said.  Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they're less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists.  Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake.  ""An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn't surprise us,"" she said. ""They do every bit as much damage."" People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said.  ""Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,"" Jones said. ""Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous - people die from running in an earthquake. Just get down and try to cover.   Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved."

NASA Facility That Controls 'Perseverance' Launch Got Hit by 4.5 Magnitude Earthquake,2020-07-30 14:18 UTC,https://www.techtimes.com/articles/251468/20200730/nasa-facility-that-controls-perseverance-launch-got-hit-by-4-5-magnitude-earthquake.htm," On Thursday, July 30, the much-awaited launch of the 2020 Mars Rover called 'Perseverance' successfully happened. Before the grand launching, an unexpected problem even happened with the launch or in the NASA facility wherein the launch was controlled. A 4.5 magnitude earthquake occurred in California. Here's what happened.   As the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) prepares for the grand launch of the Mars rover Perseverance, a sudden 4.5 magnitude earthquake occurred in the city near the launching site.  According to Independent UK, the earthquake originally impacted one mile from San Fernando in California. The launching site was happening in the other direction of Florida.  This means that the earthquake did not affect the launching of Perseverance. However, it's still not coasting clear.  Though the earthquake did not actually reach Florida, NASA was still careful about the historical event since the facility that will control the launch of the Mars Rover was located, exactly at the center of the earthquake. The mission's engineer and project manager MiMi Aung observed the said earthquake when reporters asked her about the helicopter set to be released alongside Perseverance.  ""By the way, we just had an earthquake in this room"", she said.  So far, despite the earthquake issue, the United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket carrying the Mars rover was able to withstand all issues and smoothly fly in space. As Tech Times reported, Perseverance will fly on Mars in order to complete the mission of collecting samples from the red planet. These samples will be collected in a chamber inside the machine. Once all set, the samples will be delivered to Earth, in order for scientists to test the materials.  ""We're doing transformative science,"" said Matt Wallace, the deputy project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

         INGLEWOOD (CBSLA) — A magnitude-3.7 earthquake that struck near Inglewood overnight was widely felt throughout Southern California. The earthquake was initially reported by the U.S. Geological Survey as a magnitude 3.8. It struck the unincorporated View Park-Windsor Hills area, near Inglewood, just after midnight at a depth of just over 7 miles. The Los Angeles Fire Department immediately conducted a citywide survey and found no damage done by the earthquake. Mayor Eric Garcetti also tweeted about the earthquake. A 3.8 earthquake shook the L.A. area tonight shortly after midnight. Our @LAFD has activated to conduct its routine survey of the city to assess for any damages. City teams will continue to monitor. Nearby Los Angeles International Airport also tweeted about the quake, but said there were no damages, injuries or impact to operations. An #earthquake was felt at LAX but we have no reports of damage or injuries. Crews are checking all facilities with no current impact to operations. CBS2 Meteorologist Danielle Gersh said she was sleeping but woke up to a jolt, but her dog was not bothered by the earthquake. ""Did you feel it?"" responses to the USGS showed people felt the earthquake as far north as Santa Barbara and south as San Diego.

Scientists study largest earthquake to strike Idaho in decades,2020-04-02 04:40 UTC,https://www.wbko.com/content/news/Scientists-study-largest-earthquake-in-Idaho-in-decades-569300921.html,"Scientists are now studying the largest earthquake to hit Idaho in decades.  Boise State research Professor Dr. Lee Liberty said he was with his family when he felt the magnitude 6.5 earthquake shake the ground for 20 seconds Tuesday night.  Liberty drove to the site of the earthquake in the Challis National Forest on Wednesday. He said he is dropping seismic equipment into the ground to study the aftershocks. “We are deploying seismometers, so what we do is we dig a hole about a foot, to 2 feet deep and put in a sensor the size of a small bucket, and some cables come out of the ground,” said Dr. Liberty. This is not the first big earthquake to hit the region. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck just outside Salt Lake City, Utah two weeks ago. “The question is are they related? They are on related fault systems. These are all part of larger faults extending across the Great Basin, which includes parts of Utah, all of Nevada, parts of Idaho, so in that sense, they are connected,” said Dr. Liberty. Dr. Austin Elliott at the U.S. Geological Survey said aftershocks will continue but people may not even feel them. “That’s completely common after large earthquakes. The potential for a larger earthquake is slightly greater, but still very small…this is a reminder that Idaho like other western states is earthquake country,” said Dr. Elliott. Elliott said Idahoans are lucky because the quake happened in a remote area. He said it is a wake-up call for everyone to have a plan if another earthquake strikes.

Another earthquake hits Puerto Rico. This one was a 5.0,2020-02-04 18:18 UTC,https://fox61.com/2020/02/04/another-earthquake-hits-puerto-rico-this-one-was-a-5-0/," GUAYANILLA, Puerto Rico — It started weeks ago when the first in a long series of earthquakes rocked Puerto Rico. And, the tremors haven’t stopped. Another quake struck Tuesday more than four miles beneath the ocean floor off the island’s southwest coast. The United States Geological Survey initially reported it as a 5.3 magnitude but quickly downgraded it to 5.0. The most powerful – a 6.4 magnitude earthquake – struck the U.S. territory on Jan. 7. Puerto Ricans have felt thousands of tremors since then. In January, an earthquake destroyed one of the island’s most incredible natural wonders. The soaring stone arch known as Punta Ventana – “Window Point” – collapsed into the ocean. So far, there is no word from the island on any additional damage caused by Tuesday’s earthquake.

         An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 rocked eastern Turkey on Friday, killing at least 18 people and causing some buildings to collapse. The quake injured more than 500 and left approximately 30 trapped in toppled buildings, Turkish officials said.  Elazig is some 465 miles east of the capital, Ankara. Governor Cetin Oktay Kaldirim told NTV television that three people died in the province. State-run Anadolu Agency quoted Governor Aydin Barus as saying five other people died in his nearby Malatya province. At least 225 people were injured in Elazig and 90 in Malatya. Kaldirim said a fire broke out in a building in Sivrice but was quickly brought under control. People in Elazig whose homes were damaged or were too afraid to go indoors were being moved to student dormitories or sports center amid freezing conditions. Earlier, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told NTV television that rescuers were trying to reach survivors after a four- or five-story building collapsed in the town of Maden, in Elazig. Approximately 4-5 buildings collapsed in Sivrice, where two people were hurt, he said. Local administrator Cuma Telceken said up to seven people are believed to be trapped inside two collapsed buildings in Maden. Television footage showed rescuers searching for survivors among debris. Rescue teams from neighboring provinces were dispatched to the affected areas, Anadolu Agency reported. Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said troops were on standby to help if needed. The Kandilli seismology center in Istanbul said the quake measured 6.5., while the U.S. Geological Survey gave the preliminary magnitude as 6.7, and said the quake affected not only Turkey but also Syria, Georgia and Armenia. Different earthquake monitoring centers frequently give differing estimates. Turkey sits on top of two major fault-lines and earthquakes are frequent. Two strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey in 1999, killing around 18,000 people. A magnitude 6 earthquake killed 51 people in Elazig in 2010.   Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

At least 14 dead as strong earthquake hits Turkey,2020-01-24 22:58 UTC,https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/24/at-least-14-dead-as-strong-earthquake-hits-turkey/,"Today's e-Edition Get Morning Report and other email newsletters  Get Morning Report and other email newsletters Today's e-Edition  By Umit Ozdal | Reuters ELAZIG, Turkey — A powerful earthquake struck eastern Turkey late on Friday, killing at least 20 people and collapsing buildings in towns near the center of the tremor, which was strong enough to be felt in several neighboring countries. The magnitude 6.8 quake shook Elazig province, about 340 miles east of the capital Ankara, and was followed by dozens of aftershocks. Sixteen people were killed in Elazig and four more in the neighboring province of Malatya, Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said early on Saturday. Some 920 injured were in hospitals in the region, it said. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said emergency workers were searching for 30 people under the rubble. State broadcaster TRT showed footage of dozens of workers in the dawn light using shovels to dig out a partly collapsed building in Elazig. Windows were smashed and balconies from at least four stories had crashed to the ground. Teams worked through the night with their hands, drills and mechanical diggers to remove bricks and plaster from the ruins in the city where the overnight temperature dipped to -8 degrees Celsius. “Our houses collapsed … we cannot go inside them,” said a 32-year-old man from the town of Sivrice, epicenter of the quake which struck shortly before 9 p.m. “In our village some people lost their lives. I hope God will help us,” said the man, who gave only his first name, Sinasi. “Our animals died. Our families gathered around the fire to spend the night, covered with blankets,” Sinasi said as he and a relative tried to warm themselves by a small fire. State media in Syria and Iran both reported the earthquake was felt in those countries. Local media in Lebanon said the cities of Beirut and Tripoli also felt the quake. Soylu described it as a “Level 3” incident according to the country’s emergency response plan, meaning that it called for a national response but did not require international help.   “I wish God’s mercy to our brothers who lost their lives in the earthquake, and urgent healing for those who were injured,” President Tayyip Erdogan said on Twitter. Turkey has a history of powerful earthquakes. More than 17,000 people were killed in August 1999 when a 7.6 magnitude quake struck the western city of Limit, 55 miles southeast of Istanbul. About 500,000 people were made homeless. Related Articles

         A magnitude 5.9 quake shook Puerto Rico on Saturday, causing further damage along the island's southern coast, where previous recent quakes have toppled homes and schools. Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority said outages were reported across much of southern Puerto Rico and crews were assessing possible damage at power plants.  Thousands have stayed in shelters and slept on sidewalks since Tuesday's earthquake, which killed one person, injured nine others and damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and several schools and businesses in the island's southwest region. Since December 28, there have been nearly 2,000 earthquakes in Puerto Rico, 60 of which were felt. Scientists warned this week it was impossible to predict when the tremors would stop. The tremors are the latest blow to a community that is still feeling the lasting devastation of Hurricane Maria.   Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved."

Magnitude 6.3 earthquake strikes Croatia; 1 death reported,2020-12-29 14:55 UTC,https://www.wpri.com/news/us-and-world/magnitude-6-3-earthquake-strikes-croatia-1-death-reported/,"WPRI.com Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — A strong earthquake hit central Croatia on Tuesday, causing major damage to homes and other buildings in a town southeast of the capital. Authorities said a girl was killed and at least 20 people were injured in the quake. The European Mediterranean Seismological Center said a magnitude 6.3 earthquake hit 46 kilometers (28 miles) southeast of Zagreb. Initial reports said the earthquake caused wide damage, collapsing roofs, building facades and even some entire buildings. The same area was struck by a 5.2 quake on Monday and several smaller aftershocks were felt Tuesday. Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people southeast of the capital that was hit hardest by the earthquake. At least 20 people were hospitalized with injuries, two with serious ones, they said. “The center of Petrinja as it used to be no longer exists,” Croatria’s state HRT television said in its report. “One girl died and there are injuries and people inside collapsed buildings.” “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT TV. “This is like Hiroshima – half of the city no longer exists.” “The city has been demolished, the city is no longer livable,” he said. “We need help.” Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake. “They are searching through the rubble to see if there is anyone else there,” Plenkovic said. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable.” He said the army has 500 places ready in barracks to house people, while others will be accommodated in nearby hotels and other available places. “No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” the prime minister said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that she spoke with Plenkovic and instructed an envoy to travel to Croatia as soon as possible. As a Mediterranean country, Croatia is prone to earthquakes, but not big ones. The last strong quake struck in the 1990’s when the picturesque Adriatic coast village of Ston was destroyed. Regional TV channel N1 reported live Tuesday from Petrinja that a collapsed building had fallen on a car. The footage showed firefighters trying to remove the debris to reach the car, which was buried underneath. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the car and carried into an ambulance. Fallen bricks and dust littered the streets, and many houses were completely destroyed. The Croatian military was deployed in Petrinja to help with the rescue operation. Croatian seismologist Kresimir Kuk described the earthquake as “extremely strong,” far stronger than another one that hit Zagreb and nearby areas in the spring. He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky, old buildings and to move to the newer areas of the city because of the aftershocks. In the capital, people ran out into the streets and parks in fear. Many reportedly were leaving Zagreb, ignoring a travel ban imposed because of the coronavirus outbreak. The earthquake was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia and Slovenia. It even was felt as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported. Authorities in Slovenia said the Krsko nuclear power plant was temporarily shut down following the earthquake. The power plant is jointly owned by Slovenia and Croatia and located near their border.

Little girl rescued from rubble after 65 hours in Turkey as earthquake death toll hits 85,2020-11-02 13:23 UTC,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/turkey-earthquake-girl-rescued-izmir-survivors-trapped-rubble-today/,"Watch CBS News

         Izmir, Turkey — Frantic search and rescue efforts continued Monday in Turkey's western city of Izmir, with the rescue of a little girl from the destruction caused by an earthquake three days earlier providing a glimmer of hope. But the toll was devastating; the magnitude 7.0 earthquake that struck on Friday morning had officially claimed at least 91 lives by Monday. Almost 900 more were injured, and many people were still missing. Rescuers were still racing to reach survivors trapped under the rubble of five different apartment blocks in Izmir on Monday. Dozens of people remained missing, local rescue agencies said, and family members gathered around the crumbled buildings hoping for any sign of loved ones.  Rescue workers managed to pull a 3-year-old girl out of one levelled building, saving her after she was left trapped under rubble for 65 hours. Elif Perincek became stuck with her three siblings and her mother in their family home when the quake struck. Her mother and twin sisters were rescued earlier, but her 7-year-old brother died.  Video on Turkish television showed rescue workers and TV reporters shedding tears of joy when the little girl was pulled from the crumbled concrete on Monday. But the agonizing wait continued for many other families.   Yesim Emir, a 29-year-old dentist, was believed to be stuck under a collapsed 8-storey building. Fighting back tears, her mother Sibel Suruc told CBS News on Saturday that the family was clinging to hope, ""praying she will come out alive.""   At least 106 people had been pulled out of the rubble alive by Monday, but there was still no sign of Emir.  The country's Disaster and Relief Agency said more than 5,700 personnel from state and local government agencies and civil society groups had joined the rescue efforts. Rescue workers were taking significant risks, sliding through cracks and climbing over of crushed concrete and steel of demolished buildings to reach survivors.  Burak Galip Akkurt was among them. He said survivors of past disasters had been found alive even after five days buried under debris.  ""We never give up hope. It is for the team, but also those who are waiting outside,"" he said.  There were lucky escapes when the quake struck, as well. Zeki Soysal watched the building where he had a shop partially crumble in front of his eyes. He said he didn't care that he had lost his business and was ""just grateful to be alive.""    More than 5,000 people were stuck living in tents, as at least 58 buildings had either collapsed or been critically damaged. Many residents were simply too fearful to return to their homes amid strong aftershocks. More than 1,000 aftershocks had been recorded by Monday following the initial temblor on Friday. Schools in the city were to remain closed all week.   Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to ""heal the wounds"" of the disaster before winter arrived.  Emergency accommodation in the form of a shipping container city was being built to accommodate at least 1,000 people.    The epicenter of the quake was in the Aegean Sea, roughly 10 miles off the Turkish coast. The most severe damage occurred in Izmir, but two teenagers on Greece's Samos Island were also killed. Turkey sits on active fault lines and has experienced major earthquakes in the past. A magnitude 7.5 earthquake killed more than 17,000 people in 1999.  Friday's earthquake struck as Turkey was already struggling to cope with a rising number of COVID-19 cases. Health minister Fahrettin Koca said he understood the difficulty of practicing social distancing in crowded tents and other temporary relief centers, but he still warned of the coronavirus threat. ""We urge all our citizens to continue carrying out precautions against the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. ""We cannot give in to the pandemic while we deal with the aftermath of the earthquake.""   Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved."
Huge crack appears in hill after 5.1 earthquake in North Carolina. What does it mean?,2020-08-11 11:24 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/11/huge-crack-appears-hill-after-earthquake-north-carolina-what-does-it-mean/,"(The Charlotte Observer) - That “crack” spotted in a hillside after Sparta, North Carolina, suffered a 5.1 earthquake Sunday may be a lot less ominous than some people feared. It shocked tourists in town for the weekend, but some locals say it predates the quake. Vacationer Travis Simpson-Hunt describes a scene out of a disaster movie when he recalls birds taking flight seconds before the earthquake and the sound of a train roaring through his cabin. But the damage he saw was just as disturbing. This includes a “crack” in a hillside that prompted drivers to pull over and take photos. “There was this big one (crack) and a small one below it. And then lots of cracks the width of my foot going across the road,” Simpson-Hunt said. “It was not far outside of town.” The family packed up after only one day in town and headed back to Pennsylvania, he said. The exact location of the gash in the hill has not been revealed, but at least one landowner says its not new. Its age isn’t known, but some in Sparta say it’s not a crack, but a rut where cows have tread on a family’s farm outside of town. The gash is definitely not an actual fault line crack, the U.S. Geological Survey says. “Faults do not open up during an earthquake,” it reports. Gaping cracks forming in quakes and swallowing things up are among the biggest myths associated with earthquakes, according to a report by the University of San Diego. “Certainly, earthquakes can cause cracks to form in the Earth,” the university reported. “However, these cracks are generally quite small and only rarely do they exceed a meter or two in width. And certainly these cracks don’t again close up and swallow somebody whole.” The U.S. Geological Survey says the 5.1 earthquake originated at a depth of 2.3 miles, and was the strongest of at least seven quakes that rattled the area over 24 hours. Experts say damage was more wide spread in the community than expected, because it was a relatively “shallow” earthquake. More than 100,000 people reported feeling the earthquake, the USGS reported Monday. Copyright 2020 The Charlotte Observer. All rights reserved."
"""Sadness, that sums it up in one word"" says VFW member after Sparta NC VFW damaged after 5.1 magnitude earthquake",2020-08-10 21:20 UTC,https://www.wxii12.com/article/sparta-nc-vfw-damaged-after-51-magnitude-earthquake/33565617,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. As we learn more about that 5.1 magnitude earthquake that rocked the state, we are getting a closer look at some of the damage. At the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 7034 in Sparta, the Commissioner of Insurance, along with other officials, surveyed the damage.    Folks at the VFW in Sparta said they are very concerned about two things, the serious damage to the structure and funding to help with repairs. As you step inside VFW Post 7034 in Sparta, the damage is extensive.   “When you see something like this that you’ve worked so long and hard, you regressing instead of progressing, it's sad,” said Doug Blevins, a member of the National VFW and a past state and post commander.  The building, which houses the VFW along with a museum in its basement, was built in 1947 and has endured countless weather events over the years. For veteran Doug Blevins, the VFW symbolizes determination.   “Not giving up and giving back to the community. We all served, we all fought for the community and now we are able to come home and give something back to the community,” said Blevins.  And that damage was also seen firsthand by the Commissioner of Insurance and other emergency management officials who toured the VFW. Commissioner Mike Causey said the damage is far more extensive than he realized.  “I urge people to check with their insurance agent and look into flood insurance, earthquake coverage, make sure you are covered  for wind and hail damage,” said Causey.  Thomas Owens, who is also a member of the VFW in Sparta, said the structural damage to the building is serious.    “To walk in here and see everything in the floor, a lot of things damaged, and then when you start seeing the cracks in the walls and the floors, that’s where it really got serious,” said Owens. And as the VFW tries to figure out what’s next with no earthquake coverage, they are asking the community for help in the hopes that they will be able to repair this decades-old building for generations to come.   “We’ve been there before, we can do it again. We will be building back,” said Blevins.

"Mercury Pollution has Reached the Deepest Trench, Plus the Mystery of California Earthquake Swarm Answered",2020-06-23 07:03 UTC,https://www.techtimes.com/articles/250540/20200623/mercury-pollution-has-reached-the-deepest-trench-plus-the-mystery-of-california-earthquake-swarm-answered.htm," Pollution in the sea is nothing new, but scientists have yet to realize the extent of the damage man's activities on land has done.  According to the experts, the substance they detected is known as methylmercury, which is the toxic form of mercury and could easily accumulate in certain animals, including the crustaceans and fishes living in the trench that reaches a depth of up to 36,000 feet. Although the experts say that mercury could be released by natural phenomena like volcanic eruptions, most of the mercury they detected in the trench resulted from human activities like metal mining and production.  In a research led by Joel Blum from the University of Michigan, the team acquired samples from the fishes and crustaceans in Mariana Trench from the depths of around 23,000 to 33,000 feet, located near the Philippines and the Kermadec trench in New Zealand. They detected mercury in the samples they gathered with the chemical signature of the substance, indicating that it came from the atmosphere and ended up in the water through the rain. Blum did say that some of the mercury they have found in the samples might have occurred naturally, but the researchers believe most of it most likely came from human activity. Additionally, the researcher said the mercury emission from humans had exceeded natural emission by three-fold. ""The key finding is that mercury released by humans and deposited from the atmosphere to the surface of the oceans is being transported to the most remote and deepest environments in the ocean,"" Blum said. According to Science Alert, experts in the field were able to unearth the mystery's answer by creating a 3D model of the fault zone with the help of a machine-learning algorithm. Based on their study, they found that some fluid might be the culprit, probably carbon dioxide in liquid form or water, which possibly breached a barrier of the underground rock and changed the balance of pressure and the friction along the fault line. This could have led to a series of minor tremors in the area. Unlike a significant earthquake wherein one major event is followed by minor tremors, an earthquake swarm does not have any significant event. The Cahuilla swarm, as it is known, occurred near Mt. San Jacinto in southern California.   Sign up for our free newsletter for the Latest coverage!  "

Magnitude 6.0 earthquake causes further damage in Puerto Rico,2020-01-11 14:11 UTC,https://fox8.com/2020/01/11/magnitude-6-0-earthquake-causes-further-damage-in-puerto-rico/,"Fox 8 Cleveland WJW Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A magnitude 5.9 quake shook Puerto Rico on Saturday, causing further damage along the island’s southern coast, where previous recent quakes have toppled homes and schools.  Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority said outages were reported across much of southern Puerto Rico and crews were assessing possible damage at power plants. Bárbara Cruz, a prosecutor who was in the southern coastal city of Ponce when the new quake hit, said concrete debris hit the sidewalk as buildings continued to crumble. “Everyone is out on the street,” she said. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The quake, which initially had been calculated at magnitude 6.0, was the strongest shake yet since a magnitude 6.4 quake — the strongest to hit the island in a century — struck before dawn on Tuesday, knocking out power across Puerto Rico and leaving many without water. More than 2,000 people remain in shelters, many fearful of returning to their homes, and others unable to because of extensive damage. Hundreds of quakes have shaken the island since the new year, though most were too slight to be felt. NASA reported Friday that the quakes had moved the land in parts of southern Puerto Rico as much as 5.5 inches (14 centimeters), based on satellite images before and after the temblors. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, told The Associated Press that he expects still more aftershocks as a result of the latest large one. “It’s going to re-energize an unstable situation,” he said, adding that seismologists are studying which faults were activated. “It’s a complex zone.” Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans are still without power and water, and thousands are staying in shelters and sleeping on sidewalks since Tuesday’s earthquake. That temblor killed one person, injured nine others and damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and several schools and businesses in the island’s southwest region.

         Guánica, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico is under a state of emergency after it was hit by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake. At least one person is dead and millions are without power. Many people are on edge, bracing for more aftershocks. Maria Quiñones Santiago was jolted awake Tuesday morning and said her home in Guánica was crushed. She told CBS News her home isn't safe so she plans to sleep in a parking lot. There have been over 900 tremors there since December 28, according to the Puerto Rico Seismic Network. The famous natural wonder on the coast, Punta Ventana, was destroyed by Monday's earthquake. ""It was like a horrible noise, basically you're like I don't know, like something exploded and then after that just everything started shaking. Between the shaking and everything breaking, I didn't know what was worse,"" said resident Samantha Cortez. Governor Wanda Vázquez Garced is urging people to remain calm but remains vigilant. She said you can replace property, but you can't replace lives. But the governor acknowledged Tuesday that Puerto Rico does not have an earthquake preparedness plan. It's been just over two years since Hurricane Maria hit the U.S. territory.  David Begnaud is the lead national correspondent for ""CBS Mornings"" based in New York City.

Strongest Earthquake Yet Destroys Another Puerto Rico Landmark For The 2nd Day In A Row,2020-01-07 05:00 UTC,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2020/01/07/strongest-earthquake-yet-destroys-another-puerto-rico-landmark-for-the-2nd-day-in-a-row/,"A man carries a St. Jude statue from the Inmaculada Concepcion church ruins that was built in 1841 ... [+] and collapsed after an  earthquake hit the island in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico on January 7, 2020. - A strong earthquake struck south of Puerto Rico early January 7, 2020 followed by major aftershocks, the US Geological Survey said, the latest in a series of tremors that have shaken the island since December 28. The shallow 6.4 magnitude quake struck five miles (eight kilometers) south of the community of Indios, the USGS said, revising down its initial reading of 6.6. (Photo by Ricardo ARDUENGO / AFP) (Photo by RICARDO ARDUENGO/AFP via Getty Images) The strongest in a series of earthquakes reaching back weeks jolted Puerto Rico Tuesday morning. Measuring a magnitude 6.4 on the Richter scale, the tremor damaged homes and businesses, knocked out power to a significant portion of the island and killed at least one person. The temblor comes just a day after a 5.8 quake Monday that caused the collapse of the popular natural rock formation Punta Ventana or Window Point. Tuesday’s stronger quake destroyed the Immaculate Conception church in the community of Guayanilla, a local landmark and tourist attraction originally built in 1841.  “The preliminary location of this earthquake is within about 12 km of the January 6, 2020, M 5.8 earthquake,” the US Geological Survey wrote in a report. “Over the past several weeks, hundreds of small earthquakes have occurred in this same region, beginning in earnest with a M 4.7 earthquake late on December 28 and a M 5.0 event a few hours later.” The USGS warns that more aftershocks should be expected. On Monday after the magnitude 5.8 quake, the office had advised that there was about a four percent chance of a stronger earthquake striking. Following Tuesday’s 6.4 magnitude tremor, the USGS now says there is a nine percent chance of an even stronger quake over the next week. Notably, though, the forecast for aftershocks stronger than magnitude 5.0 is 90 percent. Debris from a collapsed wall of a building litters the ground after an earthquake struck Puerto Rico ... [+] before dawn, in Ponce, Puerto Rico, Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020. (AP Photo/Carlos Giusti) Tuesday’s quake generated far more widespread damage than the less intense tremors over the past two weeks, which is bad news for an island still struggling to recover from a pair of hurricanes in 2017 that led to widespread flooding and destruction across the US territory. The earthquake is expected to be the most damaging on the island in a century. On Tuesday morning, Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced signed a state of emergency declaration, activating the National Guard. Puerto Rico is vulnerable to seismic activity thanks to being squeezed between two tectonic plates. The North America plate subducts beneath the Caribbean plate along the Puerto Rico trench on the north side of the island. To the south, the Caribbean plate’s crust slides beneath Puerto Rico. The recent earthquakes have all been shallow, but seismic activity in the area does come with a risk of tsunamis, and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that small tsunami waves of less than a foot were observed.

The USGS originally estimated the earthquake was 4.0 to 4.2 magnitude. Dr. John Ebel, a research scientist at Weston Observatory, said the magnitude of the quake can change once inspections are conducted. He pegged it at 3.6 before the USGS updated its estimation. Earthquakes of that magnitude occur in New England roughly once a year, Ebel said, but they’re often in locations where they go unnoticed by the general public.  There’s a possibility of aftershocks over the next few days, according to Ebel, but they will likely be weaker than the initial quake and the tremors may not be felt by everyone.

         LOS ANGELES (CBSLA/AP) — Android users in California will no longer need to download an app to get alerts about earthquakes. California's earthquake early warnings will be a standard feature on all Android phones, bypassing the need for users to download the state's MyShake app in order to receive alerts, the California Office of Emergency Services said. The state worked with the U.S. Geological Survey and Google, the maker of Android, to build the quake alerts into all phones that run the commonplace operating system. The deal was expected to be announced Tuesday. ""This announcement means that California's world-class earthquake early warning system will be a standard function on every Android phone — giving millions precious seconds to drop, cover and hold on when the big one hits,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. The technology does not predict earthquakes. It is designed to quickly take data from seismic sensors and send warnings to potentially affected areas if a quake of magnitude 4.5 or greater occurs and if the projected shaking at a particular location is at a certain level of intensity. The technology was initially designed to only send out alerts at a magnitude 5 or greater, but that threshold was lowered to 4.5 after the two massive Ridgecrest earthquakes in July of 2019 for which L.A. County residents did not receive any alerts.  In the early morning hours of July 30, a 4.2-magnitude earthquake struck the Pacoima area of the San Fernando Valley. It was felt across the Southland and was followed up by more than 60 aftershocks. Some with ShakeAlertLA, Los Angeles County's version of the MyShake app, reported receiving a notification, while others did not. The MyShake technology -- developed by the USGS and the University of California, Berkeley -- was released in early 2019. Warnings produced by the ShakeAlert system are also pushed through the wireless notification system that issues Amber Alerts, meaning some people receive both notifications.

         San Juan — A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck Puerto Rico before dawn on Tuesday and was followed three hours later by an aftershock measuring 6.0. They were the largest in a series of quakes that have struck the U.S. territory in recent days and caused heavy damage in some areas. The mayor of the southern city of Ponce, Mayita Meléndez, tweeted that a 77-year-old man was killed. She also told WAPA television that eight people were injured. Ponce is near the quake's epicenter.   Puerto Rico's power authority tweeted that one of the country's main power plants, which sits near the epicenter, had been damaged, but officials expected to restore power to the island later Tuesday.  Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico's Seismic Network, told The Associated Press he expects aftershocks to continue ""for some time.""    A tsunami alert was initially issued for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands but was later canceled.   Puerto Rico's governor, Wanda Vasquez, told station Radioisla she was closing government offices for the day and urged citizens to remain calm and not check damage to their homes until daylight.  Albert Rodríguez, who is from the southwest town of Guánica, said the tsunami sirens went off before officials canceled the alert. He said there is widespread damage in his neighborhood. ""The road is cracked in the middle and it lifted up,"" he said. The mayor of Guayanilla, Nelson Torres, told NotiUno radio station that the church in the public plaza of his town collapsed.   CBS News correspondent David Beganud says he's been told of damage in Guánica and Yauco, a southwestern city, including the collapse of some homes and of Yauco's main bridge. Agence France Press said people wrote on social media that they were shaken awake by quake's force. One woman tweeted that she'd been ""wrenched from sleep"" and said, ""Everybody is awake & scared all over.""  A 5.8-magnitude quake that struck early Monday morning collapsed five homes in the southwest coastal town of Guánica and heavily damaged dozens of others. It also caused small landslides and power outages. The quake was followed by a string of smaller temblors.  The shaker collapsed a coastal rock formation that had formed a sort of rounded window, Punta Ventana, that was a popular tourist draw in the southwest town of Guayanilla.  Residents in the south of the island have been terrified to go into their homes for fear that another quake will bring buildings down.   He said the quakes overall come as the North American plate and the Caribbean plate squeeze Puerto Rico.  One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, a magnitude 7.3 that struck near the island's northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.

         NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/CNN) -- A 4.0 magnitude earthquake struck near Bliss Corner, Massachusetts, on Sunday morning, according to preliminary information from the US Geological Survey. The quake was felt more than 100 miles away, in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Sound Beach, New York, on Long Island, the USGS says. According to a USGS map, the quake struck off Mishaum Point, a peninsula in southeastern Massachusetts that extends into Buzzards Bay. The epicenter appears to be about four miles south-southwest of Bliss Corner, which is located in the town of Dartmouth, just south of New Bedford and about 35 miles southeast of Providence, Rhode Island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, and the USGS said there is a low likelihood of casualties or economic losses. There is no threat of tsunami, the National Weather Service says. Small earthquakes strike New England and Long Island roughly twice a year, while moderate ones hit the region every few decades, the USGS says. The most recent New England quake to cause considerable damage was a 5.6 magnitude that shook central New Hampshire in 1940, the survey says.

         Istanbul — Covered in dust but otherwise healthy, three-year-old Ayda Gezgin was pulled from the rubble of an 8-storey building on Tuesday, four days after a magnitude 7 earthquake battered her home city of Izmir in Turkey. It was the second dramatic rescue of a toddler in as many days, but while the joy of finding the little girl alive kept hope alive for desperate families, it was tinged with tragedy.  Rescuers on the scene said Gezgin survived because she was laying next to a washing machine that shielded her from debris when her apartment building collapsed. They said she smiled when she was found. Video showed her asking for her mother as she was carried to an ambulance, but the girl's mother was one of 105 people killed by the quake. Fidan Gezgin died in the rubble of the same building her daughter escaped from on Tuesday. The official death toll could still rise as there were an undetermined number of people still believed to be missing under destroyed buildings in the hard-hit city. Turkey's Deputy Health Minister said Gezgin was in stable condition and her vital signs were normal.  More than 1,000 people were injured by the quake in Izmir, and rescuers were still racing Tuesday to find any other survivors under the ruins of at least five apartment buildings in the city, which is Turkey's 3rd largest.  Family members gathered around the crumbled buildings, hoping for any sign of loved ones.  More than 100 people have been pulled alive from 17 buildings across the city, where rescue operations began immediately after the earthquake.   Another 3-year-old girl was rescued after 65 hours under the rubble of different apartment building on Monday. She was reunited with her mother and twin sisters, who also escaped the debris. Her brother died.    Some pets have also managed to survive the collapse of their homes. Firefighters recovered four kittens on Tuesday from the same building where Gezgin was found, Izmir mayor tweeted.     But despite the stories of survival, the earthquake has left many families devastated. The body of Yesim Emir, a 29-year-old dental assistant, was recovered from the same destroyed building on Monday.  Fighting back tears, her mother Sibel Suruc had told CBS News on Saturday that the family was clinging to hope, ""praying she will come out alive."" Almost 8,000 search and rescue workers and volunteers and 25 rescue dogs were deployed to the area to assist in the aftermath of the quake.    More than 5,000 people were stuck living in tents, as at least 58 buildings had either collapsed or been seriously damaged.  Many residents were simply too fearful to return to their homes amid strong aftershocks. More than 1,000 aftershocks had been recorded by Monday following the initial temblor on Friday.

         Izmir, Turkey — Search-and-rescue efforts continue in Turkey's western city of Izmir, where a magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed at least 64 people and injured more than 900 others when it struck early Friday morning. Rescuers are racing against time to reach survivors trapped under rubble on eight different apartment blocks. Dozens of people are still unaccounted for, local agencies say, and families gathered around the crashed buildings on Sunday, hoping to find their loved ones. Yesim Emir, a 29-year-old dentist, was thought to have been stuck under an 8-story building when it collapsed. Fighting back tears, her mother Sibel Suruc said her family had been waiting to see if she survived. ""I am praying she will come out alive,"" she told CBS News.  So far, 104 people have been pulled out of the rubble alive, Turkey's environment and urbanization minister said.    The country's Disaster and Relief Agency reported more than 5,700 personnel from state agencies, local governments and civil society groups had been mobilized for rescue work. Hundreds of them were also called for food distribution, psycho-social help and damage control for buildings. Local TV stations showed fearless rescue workers sliding through the cracks of crashed buildings to reach survivors.  Burak Galip Akkurt is one of them. He said survivors of past disasters had been found alive even after five days of being buried under debris.  ""We never give up hope. It is for the team, but also those who are waiting outside,"" he said.   There were lucky escapes when the quake struck, as well. Zeki Soysal watched the building where he had a shop partially crash in front of his eyes. He said he doesn't care that he lost his business, and is ""just grateful to be alive.""    More than 2,000 people will spend another night in tents. Many fear to go back inside their homes as aftershocks continue, with more than 900 recorded in the last two days. Schools in the city will also be closed next week.  Forty-one buildings were listed as heavily damaged. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to ""heal the wounds"" before winter arrives.  The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Aegean Sea, roughly 10 miles off the coast of Turkey. The most severe damage occurred in Izmir, but two teenagers on Greece's Samos Island were also killed.  A small tsunami flooded the streets of the town of Seferihisar on the Turkish coast, killing a woman in a wheelchair, local media reported.   Turkey sits on active fault lines and experienced major earthquakes in the past. A magnitude 7.5 earthquake killed more than 17,000 people in 1999.      The most recent quake came as Turkey struggles with an increasing number of COVID-19 cases. Health minister Fahrettin Koca said he understands the difficulty of practicing social distancing in crowded tents or other temporary relief centers, but still warned against the coronavirus threat. ""We urge all our citizens to continue carrying out precautions against the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. ""We cannot give in to the pandemic while we deal with the aftermath of the earthquake.""   Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved."
"Deadly earthquake strikes Turkish coast, Greek island",2020-10-30 18:09 UTC,https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/10/30/deadly-earthquake-strikes-turkish-coast-greek-island/,"Today's e-Edition Get Morning Report and other email newsletters  Get Morning Report and other email newsletters Today's e-Edition  By Zeynep Bilginsoy and Elena Becatoros | Associated Press ISTANBUL — A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 19 people and injuring over 700 amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected by the quake, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 17 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, including one who drowned, and 709 were injured, according to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Among the dead were the wife and two children of the secretary-general of the Turkish Medical Association’s Izmir branch, the group said. On Samos, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying “Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children.” At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. Search-and-rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble, including one survivor who was found about six hours after the quake. Emergency teams continued digging after nightfall and cranes lifted concrete slabs from the wreckage.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul’s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey’s largest. Video on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer urged residents to not enter damaged buildings and to be mindful of social distancing and mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Clouds of dust or smoke rose from several spots as buildings collapsed in the quake. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter — roughly 10 kilometers — potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks and warned that buildings could collapse in a strong aftershock. The government and cities like Istanbul sent more than 3,000 rescue personnel to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens. France offered assistance to both countries. The secretary of state for European affairs tweeted France’s “full solidarity with Greece and Turkey” and said “we are ready to offer the necessary aid.” The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos along with a search-and-rescue team, paramedics and engineers. Some islanders planned to spend the night in emergency tents for fear of aftershocks. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. “We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,” Turkey’s Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. “This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We’re ready to help if Greece needs it.” Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, tweeted that he had phoned Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together.” Erdogan responded to the tweet with his thanks and offered his condolences. “Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,” he wrote. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and NATO allies. Becatoros reported from Athens.

"'Well, this is Iceland': Earthquake interrupts Prime Minister's interview",2020-10-20 20:35 UTC,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/20/europe/iceland-earthquake-interview-scli-intl/index.html,"
      Iceland’s Prime Minister was interrupted by an earthquake while filming an interview on Tuesday – but managed to shrug off the intrusion and finish her answer.
   
Katrin Jakobsdottir was discussing the impact of the pandemic on tourism with the Washington Post when her house started to shake, visibly startling the Icelandic leader.
   
      “Oh my god, there’s an earthquake,” she said with a gasp. “Sorry, there was an earthquake right now. Wow.”
   
      But Jakobsdottir quickly pivoted back to the matter at hand, laughing: “Well this is Iceland” and continuing her response to the question.
    
      “Yes I’m perfectly fine, the house is still strong, so no worries,” she later added.
   
      Jakobsdottir, 44, has been Iceland’s Prime Minister since 2017.
   
      The 5.6 magnitude earthquake struck on Tuesday afternoon 10 kilometers southwest of Hafnarfjordur, a coastal town near the capital of Reykjavík, according to the United States Geological Survey, which measures quakes worldwide.
   
      The tremble led to reports of damage around the capital. Earthquakes are common in Iceland, which boats a sweeping landscape dotted with dozens of volcanoes. 
    
      As the camera shook, a still-smiling Ardern told Newshub AM Show host Ryan Bridge, “We’re just having a bit of an earthquake here, quite a – quite a decent shake here.”

          CBS Los Angeles reports that the focal point of the earthquake was almost the same location as the magnitude-5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquake in 1987, according to seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones. Friday's quake is one of the largest to hit the Los Angeles Basin in a few years. There were reports felt in La Habra, Long Beach, Oxnard, Ontario, Pasadena, near the Beverly Hills area, and other regions throughout LA County.  Some residents said they felt jolts from about three seconds to possibly up to a minute long.  All 106 fire stations in the city of Los Angeles activated, each checking their areas for damage, according to Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph M. Terrazas. Approximately two aftershocks at magnitudes 2.1 and 1.6 were reported, Jones told CBS LA.  Jones said that 5% of the time, an initial earthquake may actually be a foreshock that is preceding a larger earthquake. There is also an approximately 50% chance that an aftershock around 3.0 magnitude strength could be felt, according to Jones. There were no reports of damages or injuries in the city of LA on Friday night, Chief Terrazas said. The Los Angeles Police Department also said there were ""no significant incidents to report"" related to the earthquake, but urged residents to prepared for potential aftershocks and only use 911 for emergencies.

"A new earthquake warning system, powered by Google, comes to California",2020-08-13 08:22 UTC,https://www.myarklamiss.com/news/national-news/a-new-earthquake-warning-system-powered-by-google-comes-to-california/,"KTVE - myarklamiss.com Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.     California (NBC) (08/13/20)— Android phones will be used to sense earthquakes around the world and may one day be able to provide global warnings, with the first mass alert system unveiled Tuesday in California, Google announced.  Google, which helped develop Android, worked with California and the U.S. Geological Survey to build the quake alerts into all phones that run the commonplace mobile operating system.  Android users who have enabled location services and are near a quake of magnitude 4.5 or greater will receive a full-screen earthquake warning telling them to drop to the floor and seek cover. The screen also will provide estimates of the quake’s magnitude and distance from the user. The alert is based on the projected shaking at a particular location and a certain level of intensity.  Depending on their distance from a quake, people could get several seconds or perhaps a full minute of warning. The warnings are powered by California’s ShakeAlert system, which uses signals from more than 700 seismometers installed around the state that can sense seismic waves. However, users won’t need to download the state’s MyShake app in order to receive the alerts.  That application, developed by the University of California, Berkeley and launched last year, has been downloaded by only about 1 million of California’s 40 million residents. By contrast, many millions of people own Android phones. “This announcement means that California’s world-class earthquake early warning system will be a standard function on every Android phone — giving millions precious seconds to drop, cover, and hold on when the big one hits,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. IPhone users won’t receive the alerts through Apple’s operating system, but they can download the MyShake app. Also Tuesday, Google announced that Android phones will begin detecting earthquakes from around the world through their motion-sensing accelerometers. “Your Android phone can be a mini-seismometer, joining millions of other Android phones out there to form the world’s largest earthquake detection network,” according to a Google blog post. More than 2 billion devices run the Android operating system. Hundreds of millions of people live in earthquake-prone areas, but many countries lack the resources to build detection and alert systems, Google said. The information will be used at first to provide fast and accurate information on Google Search, but Google said it could begin sending out earthquake alerts next year.

Magnitude 5.8 Puerto Rico Earthquake Destroys Famous Landmark,2020-01-06 05:00 UTC,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2020/01/06/magnitude-58-puerto-rico-earthquake-destroys-famous-landmark/," The island of Puerto Rico was jolted awake early Monday morning by an earthquake registering 5.8 on the Richter scale. The tremors have already been followed by a number of aftershocks, and all the shaking has caused the collapse of the popular natural rock formation Punta Ventana or Window Point.  In addition to sending the top of Punta Ventana into the ocean, the temblor damaged homes in nearby Guanica, sent rockslides into roads and caused power outages, according to the Miami Herald. The Monday morning quake is the strongest from a series of nerve-rattling tremors that have shook the island in recent weeks, including one registering 5.0 magnitude on December 29. “This is one of the strongest quakes to date since it started shaking on Dec. 28,” Angel Vazquez, the emergency management director for the southern coastal city of Ponce, told The Associated Press. “It lasted a long time.” One resident whose home collapsed described the scene as “hell.”  This latest natural disaster comes as the island is still struggling to recover from the catastrophic impacts of Hurricane Maria in 2017. The earthquake struck on Three Kings Day, when many businesses and offices are shut for the day. So far, no casualties are reported, but authorities are warning residents to brace for more aftershocks. The US Geological Survey estimates there is just a four percent chance that Monday’s quake will be followed by an even stronger one in the coming days and weeks. Developing story... "

         A 4.5-magnitude earthquake hit Puerto Rico on Thursday in the latest of a rare string of quakes that has frightened many in the U.S. territory. The most recent quake occurred eight miles south of Guayanilla at a shallow depth of four miles and was felt in the capital of San Juan and elsewhere in Puerto Rico, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. No immediate damage was reported. ""We haven't stopped shaking,"" said Ángel Vázquez, emergency management director for the southern coastal town of Ponce. ""It's the first time something like this happens."" The flurry of quakes began the night of December 28, with a 4.7-magnitude quake followed by a 5.1-magnitude one that hit near Puerto Rico's south coast and sent dozens of panicked people into the streets. Goods fell off supermarket shelves, cracks in homes were reported in some coastal towns, and a large rock fell and blocked a road. No injuries were reported. Since then, more than 1,100 earthquakes have occurred in that region. The majority have not been felt, except for the 4.2-magnitude one that hit December 31 and the one on Thursday. ""I've spent 29 years with Puerto Rico's Seismic Network, and it's the first time I observe this kind of activity,"" director Víctor Huérfano told The Associated Press. ""There's no way to predict when it's going to end, or if it's going to lead to a major event.""  ""In general, the force behind all of this is the North American plate and the Caribbean plate squeezing Puerto Rico,"" he said. A similar cluster of quakes occurred last year along Puerto Rico's northwest coast following a 6.0-magnitude earthquake in late September that led to more than 1,200 quakes in that area, Huérfano said. One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a 7.3-magnitude quake struck near the island's northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.

         A powerful 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck the Aleutian Islands area off the Alaskan peninsula late Tuesday, prompting a tsunami warning for cities and towns within 200 miles of the epicenter. Police in Kodiak urged residents to rush to higher ground ahead of the tsunami's possible arrival. Aftershocks were being felt. The tusnami warning was canceled within about four hours. But a tsunami that measured 0.8 feet in the city of Sand Point was generated, reports CBS Anchorage affiliate KTVA-TV. Jeremy Zidek, with the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, told the station Sand Point sounded sirens twice and evacuated, but it wasn't clear what, if any, damage occurred. He said evacuees were told to wait for word from local officials before returning home.      ""Based on the preliminary earthquake parameters ... hazardous tsunami waves are possible for coasts located within 300 km of the earthquake epicenter,"" the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. The warning covered South Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands. There was no tsunami threat for coastal areas of Canada and the U.S., the center said. The quake was felt hundreds of miles away.  Tsunami warning in kodiak AK pic.twitter.com/pBio9lnWDF Joe Vigil, an anchor/reporter at KTVA, tweeted that boats were leaving the Kodiak harbor for higher ground and lines were forming at gas stations. He said sirens went off again after an aftershock.  ""Bed and curtains were going. Felt like a very long quake!"" a witness in Homer, Alaska, 400 miles from the epicenter, said on the quake monitoring website msc-csem.org.  Alaska is part of the seismically active ""Pacific Ring of Fire.""  Alaska was hit by a 9.2-magnitude earthquake in March 1964, the strongest ever recorded in North America. It devastated Anchorage and unleashed a tsunami that slammed the Gulf of Alaska, the US west coast, and Hawaii.  More than 250 people were killed by the quake and the tsunami.

         A magnitude 3.1 earthquake struck in East Freehold, New Jersey, early Wednesday morning, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Residents took to social media to express their shock at the rare occurrence as numerous reports of shaking have been reported across the state and in New York City. Hundreds of people as far away as Philadelphia and Long Island, New York, contributed to the USGS' ""Did You Feel It?"" map, reporting only weak or light shaking and no damage.    Woah my whole house just shook Everyone is piping up in Jersey right now about an earthquake but I felt that in Brooklyn too that earthquake dead felt like a tom and jerry scene where they run under the carpet but the carpet was my house ""It would be very surprising for us to see anything more than you know, damaged shelves or picture frames falling off of windows,"" said Robert Sanders, a geophysicist with the survey.     NJ.com reports that on Aug. 23, 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake in central Virginia shook buildings in New Jersey. It was one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded in the eastern U.S. East Coast earthquakes are far less common than in the West, but they tend to be felt over a broad area. ""The waves are able to reverberate and travel pretty happily out for miles,"" said U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Susan Hough. The USGS said the earthquake was centered 1.25 miles south, southeast of the center of East Freehold. It hit just before 2 a.m. ""That's a fairly uncommon event magnitude for quakes in this area,"" Sanders said. Since 1970, there have been two other quakes within 10 miles of this location, a 3.5 in 1979 and a 3.1 in 1992, he said.     Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved."

(WKRG) — Milton resident Stu Jackson was at Opie’s Kool Stop Cafe and Coffee Shop Thursday morning when the ground and walls started shaking. “I started to get a little concerned because you don’t feel typically the ground move that strongly here,” Jackson, a veteran and radio personality, said. A 3.8 magnitude earthquake hit Pollard, Alabama about 10 a.m. Thursday morning, which is about 14 miles away from the shop. The cafe’s owner, Lori Elder, said she was talking to Jackson when she felt the rumbles. “All of a sudden, we feel something shaking and at first I think it’s just my girls upstairs bringing in a delivery,” Elder said. “Next thing I know I can feel it under my feet.” The earthquake was felt all across the Florida/Alabama state line. There were some reports as far away as East Milton. Flomaton resident Louise Stacey said she didn’t feel the earthquake, but it did knock down a tree branch onto her shed. “It’s kind of scary,” Stacey said. “It’s kind of weird isn’t it? You never know what’s going to happen.” Jackson, who works at WPFL radio, said he took many calls from local residents like Stacey. He said he’s lived in northern Santa Rosa County for many years, but the earthquake Thursday was the strongest he has ever felt. “When you feel the ground move, you can automatically tell this is something serious,” he said. There have been no reports of major damage at this time. LATEST STORIES Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

An earthquake rocked Alleghany County, near the Virginia/North Carolina line, Sunday morning.  The quake measured as a 5.1 magnitude on the Richter scale. The depth of the quake is measured at about two miles. The quake could be felt in many areas including as far north as Lynchburg, Virginia; as far south as Atlanta, Georgia; as far east as Greenville and as far west as Nashville, Tennessee, according to reports from the US Geological Survey.  According to WXII 12 News' Meteorologist Brian Slocum, the area had roughly four earthquakes in all, starting Saturday evening. There are currently no reports of any damage, but there could be some damage near Sparta because of the magnitude of the earthquake. ""Just woke up to a shaking house in Mt.

"California's Earthquake Swarm was Triggered by Fluid Spillage, AI Algorithm Says",2020-06-23 06:04 UTC,https://www.techtimes.com/articles/250542/20200623/californias-earthquake-swarm-was-triggered-by-fluid-spillage-ai-algorithm-says.htm," Using 3D modeling and machine learning, scientists claim they have solved the mystery of the tiny earthquakes that rumbled daily under Cahuilla, California, from early 2016 to late 2019 - nearly four years. Some kind of natural fluid, such as water or liquid carbon dioxide, is likely to be the culprit. As a new study points out, it undoubtedly breached a barrier in the underground rock, altering the pressure and friction equilibrium along the fault line, and contributing to a long sequence of minor tremors. The study can be seen in the Science journal.  The techniques deployed here could prove vital in understanding and predicting future earthquakes. Like the one that happened near Cahuilla, both major quakes and smaller swarms add up to tens of thousands of individual occurrences. Around 22,000 mysterious earthquakes rumbled Southern California since 2016. The behavior has confounded scientists for years.  ""What we're learning is that you really need to understand the fault in three dimensions to get a clear picture of why earthquake swarms occur."" Ross and his colleagues used neural networks to examine thousands of seismic events, ranging from 0.7 to 4.4 in magnitude. The analysis revealed a deep, narrow 3D fault line extending down approximately 8 kilometers (5 miles). The model showed an underground reservoir's likely presence. It was initially cut off from the fault zone before it leaked through and triggered the tremors. Spotting this was only made possible by high-resolution simulation of the team. If the work is completed, it sheds light when viewed in profile on a narrow, 50-meter long fault zone with steep curves. It was those curves, Ross says, that revealed the explanation for seismic activity in the area for many years. The study says the leading potential explanation for the swarms was groundwater circulation or a slow slippage on an active fault, called fault creep. ""The detail here is incredible,"" seismologist Elizabeth Vanacore from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez, who wasn't involved in the research, told Maya Wei-Haas at National Geographic. ""This type of work is cutting edge and really where the science is going."" Swarms like the one studied here typically don't contain any major quakes. They are also much less predictable than the big earthquakes, which usually begin with a major shock followed by slowly declining aftershocks. What made this particular swarm fascinating is it lasted too long -- more like a swarm in slow motion. Other swarms are likely to last days, weeks, or months. The scientists say it is now winding down, probably because the fluid has reached an impermeable barrier. The next step is to test the simulation technique further afield, across southern California and elsewhere - it could be that further earthquake swarms are responsible for natural fluid injections, which seismologists would study using this methodology. ""These observations bring us closer to providing concrete explanations for how and why earthquake swarms start, grow, and terminate,"" says Ross.

"Devastating Puerto Rico earthquake stirs fear, uncertainty for relatives around Philly",2020-01-07 18:25 UTC,https://www.inquirer.com/news/earthquake-puerto-rico-relief-local-efforts-maria-quinones-sanchez-20200107.html,"Philadelphia Councilmember Maria Quiñones-Sánchez, who was born in Puerto Rico, is joining with others starting to plan relief efforts. “So many infrastructure problems still remain from past disasters,” she said The earthquake that hit Puerto Rico before dawn Tuesday left a crack in the wall of the house where Camden City Council Member Felisha Reyes-Morton’s mother has lived for years. Elsewhere in Santa Isabel, on the island’s southern coast, other family members are without power, relying on spotty WiFi connections for information on social media. “People are confused,” said Reyes-Morton, who has aunts, cousins, grandparents, and other relatives living within 25 miles of where the 6.4 magnitude quake hit. “It’s hard for the government to communicate at a time like this, with no electricity and damaged roads. There is fear and a lot of uncertainty.” As natural disasters have pummeled Puerto Rico, many have fled the island for Philadelphia, drawn by its relatively low cost of living and thriving Puerto Rican community. There were about 134,000 Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia as of 2017, nearly 50% more than two decades earlier. An additional 23,000 live in Camden, about a third of the city’s population.  Gladys Carrión, a middle school teacher at Julia de Burgos School in Philadelphia’s Fairhill section, has two adult sons living in Yabucoa, on the island’s east coast. When she spoke with them a few hours after the quake on Tuesday, both said they were fine and urged her to keep calm. She’s still worried after aftershocks and other ripple effects. “I feel helpless with this situation, after all we’ve been through,” she said. Philadelphia City Councilmember Maria Quiñones-Sánchez, who was born in Puerto Rico, had been planning a trip there this week to visit family. Her relatives are safe, she said. Meanwhile, she and others are starting to plan how to help with relief efforts. After Hurricane Maria in 2017, the local Latin American community joined with other groups like churches and synagogues to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, she said. “So many infrastructure problems still remain from past disasters,” she said. “The electric grid is still very fragile. A lot of things have been normalized; it’s not unusual to lose power or water. People are more nonchalant about it. That becomes oppressive day after day. It’s very sad.” Vanessa Colón Almenas, a reporter for Puerto Rico’s Centro de Periodismo Investigativo (Center for Investigative Journalism), said that island residents were waiting in long lines for gas, as they did after Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and that the ground had been shaking off and on for the last week and a half, leading many to fear that more quakes could be ahead.  Eight people were injured in Ponce, Mayor Mayita Meléndez told WAPA television, and police confirmed that 73-year-old Nelson Martínez Guillén had died in the quake. Power went out on the island as plants shut down to protect themselves, with two suffering minor damage. Water systems were also shut down, buildings collapsed, and major highways caved in. Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced issued an executive order Tuesday to activate the National Guard, stating that “the earthquake caused even more significant damage to critical infrastructure, life and property, including roads, bridges, schools, homes and other related damages.” This story contains information from the Associated Press."

         A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 14 people and injuring hundreds amid collapsed buildings and flooding, officials said. A small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir, the city in western Turkey that was the worst affected, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least 12 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, including one who drowned, and 419 were injured, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. On Samos, where a tsunami warning was issued, two teenagers died after being struck by a wall that collapsed. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted condolences, saying ""Words are too poor to describe what one feels before the loss of children."" Another eight people were reportedly treated at the local hospital for light injuries. Izmir Governor Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people were rescued from wrecked buildings, with four destroyed and more than 10 collapsed. Others suffered less severe damage, he said, but did not give an exact number. A man told the Reuters news agency he couldn't think when the ground was shaking. ""All you try to do is to go out,"" he said. ""Everywhere was collapsing down, luckily our building was intact. We were really panicked and managed to go out at the very last minute."" Search and rescue efforts were underway in at least 17 buildings, the Turkish disaster agency said. Turkish media showed rescuers pulling people from the rubble. Smoke rose from several spots. The U.S. Geological Survey put the earthquake's magnitude at 7.0. The Kandilli institute said it had a magnitude of 6.9. It is common for preliminary magnitudes to differ in the early hours and days after a quake.  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it was also felt across the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul's governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey's largest. Videos on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferihisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted that 38 ambulances, two ambulance helicopters and 35 medical rescue teams were working in the city of Izmir. The disaster agency and Turkish Red Crescent were in Izmir, while Istanbul and other cities sent in rescue teams. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks. He said residents of affected areas must be careful not to enter buildings that might have been damaged in the initial quake, as they could collapse in a strong aftershock. On Samos, damage was reported to buildings and roads, and residents were warned to stay away from the coast for fear of a tsunami. Water rose above the dock in the main harbor of Samos and flooded the street. Residents also were told to stay away from buildings amid aftershocks.  The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, headed to Samos, as were a search and rescue team, paramedics and engineers. In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity. ""We pray that there is no further loss of live in Turkey or Greece and we send our best wishes to all those affected on both sides of the earthquake,"" Turkey's Communications Director Fahrettin Altun tweeted. ""This tragedy reminds us once again how close we are despite our differences over policy. We're ready to help if Greece needs it."" Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, tweeted that he had phoned Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ""to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together."" Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and NATO allies.   Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved."

      It was a long, dizzying week to be a Californian.
   
      The Golden State has been trying to contain the surge of coronavirus cases that started in the summer while dozens of wildfires are burning and smoke is making it hard to breathe. Then, as if not enough crises had collided, Southern California was caught in the clutches of yet another hazard – an earthquake. 
   
      Here’s more about what people in California faced last week:
   
      As more than 19,000 firefighters scrambled to contain multiple blazes in the state, they had to mourn one of their own, officials said. 
   
      A firefighter was killed Thursday in Southern California’s El Dorado Fire, the blaze sparked this month by a botched gender reveal party, according to the San Bernardino National Forest Service.
   
      The state has seen more than 3.4 million acres scorched so far this year, killing 26 people and reducing hundreds of homes to ashes. 
   
      Numerous communities were ordered to evacuate after the Bobcat Fire in Los Angeles County exploded to 91,000 acres, fueled by strong winds.
   
      Fire officials have warned that warn and dry conditions could elevate the danger of fire over the coming days. 
   
      Smoke from the devastating wildfires has stretched for miles, creating hazardous air conditions in California and nearby states. 
   
      The air was so full of smoke in San Francisco earlier this week that it ranked among the top big cities with worst air quality in the world, according to IQAir, a group which tracks global air quality.
   
      The smoke has impacted other cities, including Los Angeles and even Yosemite National Park, which the National Park Service closed to all visitors last week because conditions were in the unhealthy and hazardous range.
    
      The state appears to be making progress to slow down the spread of coronavirus, but the threat lingers. 
   
      Hospitalizations have dropped 22% in the past two weeks and the percentage of tests coming back positive is down to 3.6% after a surge in cases over the summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news briefing on Wednesday.
   
      “We are moving forward and seeing a decline in the rate of spread and transmission of Covid-19,” Newsom said.
    
      But wildfires have become a challenge for health officials. Newsom said access to state’s mobile testing sites has been impacted by air quality issues.
    
      Pictures were rattling on the wall, plants were knocked over and some people woke up to beds shaking. 
   
      An earthquake hit near the city of El Monte – east of downtown Los Angeles –late Friday night,  but it was felt widely in San Diego, Valencia and the San Fernando Valley areas, the US Geological Survey said. 
    
      While there were no reports of serious injuries or damage, it was a reminder for those in the greater Los Angeles area that the earthquake risk is far from over.
    
      While experts can’t fully predict quake aftershocks, Jones says, the chances of a subsequent larger quake is usually less than 5%.

         FREEHOLD, N.J. (CBSNewYork) -- There was a shocking wake-up call for many in New Jersey way before the dawn Wednesday as an earthquake shook homes and rattled nerves. ""It just shook,"" Freehold Township resident Renee Brookins told CBS2's Vanessa Murdock. ""My entire house was shaking. I thought someone broke in,"" added 15-year-old Alexandra Cappello. ""The wife, the dog, myself, jumped out of bed,"" Freehold's Bob Liamero said. A 3.1 magnitude earthquake centered near Monmouth County's Freehold Township woke a lot of folks, including Amy Carr. In fact, it was her dogs acting nutty that woke her.  ""I went to wake up my husband and he said, 'Oh, you just a bad dream, go back to sleep,'"" Carr said. Both did just that, but in the morning Ryan Carr decided to check his surveillance video. ""I went back to 2 a.m. and you hear a loud bang,"" he said. ""I thought it was an explosion. I thought maybe a house blew up,"" Liamero said. ""I might have thought it was a truck hitting something,"" added Scott Wolman of Freehold.  There were so many reports of hearing that alarming sound, so Murdock asked John Armbruster, a seismologist with Columbia's Lamont Dougherty Earth Observatory, what it was. ""You're hearing the rocks breaking and moving,"" Armbruster said. Thankfully nobody was hurt and no property was damaged. The quake occurred about three miles into the bedrock beneath the Garden State along a fracture or fault, said Art Lerner-Lam, deputy director at Lamont Dougherty. ""This earthquake was in fact felt quite broadly, all the way down to Camden and up through New York and Westchester County,"" Lerner-Lam said. Experts said one of the most surprising things about the earthquake is that is seems so surprising to many. ""Every year or two the New York City area would have something like that,"" Armbruster said. A magnitude 4 happens every 20-30 years. The most recent centered in Ardsley, N.Y. in 1985. A magnitude 5 is the strongest ever felt in the region, and it happens every 100 years or so. The last was in New York City in 1884. ""In a pure mathematical sense, New York is overdue for a magnitude 5 earthquake,"" Armbruster said. Which would cause more than just a rude awakening. ""We felt it, too -- 2020, what else is new?"" Brookins said. There are still a few months to go, we shall see. You can get the latest news, sports and weather on our brand new CBS New York app. Download here.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

         A powerful 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck the Aleutian Islands area off the Alaskan peninsula late Tuesday, prompting a tsunami warning for cities and towns within 200 miles of the epicenter. Police in Kodiak urged residents to rush to higher ground ahead of the tsunami's possible arrival. Aftershocks were being felt. The tusnami warning was canceled within about four hours. But a tsunami that measured 0.8 feet in the city of Sand Point was generated, reports CBS Anchorage affiliate KTVA-TV. Jeremy Zidek, with the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, told the station Sand Point sounded sirens twice and evacuated, but it wasn't clear what, if any, damage occurred. He said evacuees were told to wait for word from local officials before returning home.      ""Based on the preliminary earthquake parameters ... hazardous tsunami waves are possible for coasts located within 300 km of the earthquake epicenter,"" the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. The warning covered South Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands. There was no tsunami threat for coastal areas of Canada and the U.S., the center said. The quake was felt hundreds of miles away.

Alaska is part of the seismically active ""Pacific Ring of Fire.""  Alaska was hit by a 9.2-magnitude earthquake in March 1964, the strongest ever recorded in North America.

         ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP/CBS SF) -- A powerful 7.8 earthquake struck the Alaska Peninsula late Tuesday, triggering a tsunami warning that sent residents fleeing to higher ground before it was called off without any damaging waves. Hundreds wore masks against the spread of the coronavirus as they gathered in shelters.   ""No reports of any damage,"" Kodiak Police Sgt. Mike Sorter told The Associated Press early Wednesday morning. ""No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal."" The quake triggered tsunami warning for a South Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands that was called off early Wednesday about two hours after the quake. Tsunami warning sirens could be heard blaring in videos posted on social media as residents heeded warnings to evacuate. On Kodiak Island, the local high school opened its doors for evacuees, as did the local Catholic school, the Anchorage Daily New s reported. ""We've got a high school full of people,"" said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. ""I've been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,"" he told the Daily News. ""Everything's as calm as can be. We've got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,"" he said. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later called off the tsunami threat for other U.S. and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America as well. ""There was actually even no reported wave activity for our area,"" Sorter said of the tsunami that was eventually canceled. According to the USGS, since 1900 there have been six other earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 and higher within 155 miles (250 km) of Tuesday's quake. The largest of those was a 8.2 quake in 1938. The Alaska-Aleutian Trench was also where a magnitude 9.2 quake in 1964 was centered.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

'It's really devastating': Recovery efforts underway for earthquake victims in Puerto Rico,2020-01-08 17:34 UTC,https://www.wesh.com/article/its-really-devastating-recovery-efforts-underway-for-earthquake-victims-in-puerto-rico/30444576,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. Puerto Rico is still reeling from a pair of destructive earthquakes that occurred over the last two days. Much of Puerto Rico is still without power as engineers work to restore it in phases. Terrified of sleeping indoors as aftershocks continue, some people put mattresses in their front yards while others spent the night under white tents and tarps.  The biggest of the two quakes was a 6.4 magnitude, and is one of the largest felt there in a century. It left homes destroyed, displaced hundreds of people and recovery could be more than $3 billion. The earthquakes come after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in September 2017.  Some people in southern Puerto Rico said the earthquakes' damage was worse. Overnight, President Donald Trump approved FEMA assistance for the island. The effects of the earthquakes are also being felt in Central Florida. WESH 2 News spoke with people who have family and friends on the island.""It's very hard for the family down here to see what's going on in Puerto Rico. Everybody's scared. Nobody's sleeping. It's very hard,” Marangely Lopez said. At Melao Bakery in Orlando, a popular Puerto Rican restaurant, many people have their minds on their family and friends now suffering again without power and other basic resources. ""Every time I call my mom and she cries, she's just hysterical. She's scared,” Lopez said. Lopez lives in Puerto Rico and came to Florida to visit her children to ring in the new year. With her mother and two of her kids on the island, she's planning to go back as soon as she can. ""It's very hard. It's just hard, because we want to be there, but we can't. And they're going through a lot,” Lopez said. ""It's really devastating,” said Johnattan Lozado, who moved to Orlando from Puerto Rico six years ago and still has lots of family and friends there. “Because we just had like, the disaster with Hurricane Maria, the island is still recovering. I still knew people that still didn't have electricity. With these earthquakes, that just adds a layer of difficulty to like, get everybody back to speed,” Lozado said. Some people say the earthquakes and the threat of more make this even worse than Maria.""It's horrible because when a hurricane is coming, they'll let you know, and you know how to prepare and what to do, but an earthquake, it's not the same thing,” Lopez said.

Those were some of residents’ initial thoughts when a 3.8 magnitude earthquake hit near the Alabama-Florida state line. “Standing and just chatting with my coworkers and all of a sudden there was a quick vibration and then I looked around, and it happened again within a few seconds,” said Kamal Hossain.  With the earthquake not bringing catastrophe along with it, he was happy to jest, telling his coworker, “It’s probably that big guy walking around.” Down the street at Opie’s Cafe and Coffee Shop, the quake rattled the sign above the cash register. “All of a sudden we feel something shaking and first we think it’s my girls upstairs because they’re bringing in delivery,” said owner Laurie Elder. “And the next thing I know, I can feel it under my feet.”

A section of US 95 will close from June 3-17 for roadway repairs to fix damage caused by the May 15 6.5-magnitude earthquake. Drivers will be detoured to State Route 360 and US 6 to get around construction just north of Coaldale Junction. The Nevada Department of Transportation says $2.43 million in repairs will take two weeks. About 2,300 vehicles use that section of road every day, NDOT estimates.  The highway has been in use since reopening later in the day after the earthquake, but the half-mile section of US 95 requires further repairs for 3-inch gaps opened by the quake.

         TONOPAH, Nevada (CBS SF/CNN) -- A series of earthquakes ranging in magnitude of 6.5 to 4.9 rocked western Nevada in rapid-fire succession early Friday, awakening residents in some communities in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The initial quake struck about 4.7 miles deep, the USGS said, and at least six sizable aftershocks were recorded shortly thereafter, including two with estimated magnitudes of 5.4. According to the USGS, shaking from the largest Tonopah quake was felt as far away as Oakland, San Jose and other East and South Bay communities. Several people in Fresno reported swaying lights and being awakened by the jolt.  Across the region, residents took to Twitter to respond to the quake. @NVEarthquakes whoa! Just felt an #earthquake in Reno. This was 6 minutes AFTER the quake as felt in Sparks.

""There have been almost 8,000 'Did you feel it' reports, with people logging into USGS to report it,"" Laustsen said. Esmeralda County Sheriff's Deputy Jacob Stritenberger felt the main earthquake and it was the biggest one he's ever experienced, he said. ""North- and southbound is undriveable around mile marker 89,"" Stritenberger said. ""According to people who called it in, it's buckled really bad."" Part of U.S. 95 -- the main highway between Las Vegas and Reno -- was closed as state troopers and sheriff's deputies from Esmeralda and Mineral counties checked the highway and state Route 360 for possible damage, the Mineral County sheriff's office said. Nevada Highway Patrol photos showed cracks on U.S. 95 that Trooper Hannah DeGoey said were caused by the earthquake. No injuries were reported and crews were working to reopen the highway. Keith Hasty was working at the Super 7 gas station on Main Street in Tonopah told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the quake rattled his store. ""It really shook a lot of groceries off the shelves,"" Hasty said. He said he hadn't heard of any damage but the temblor did startle the local residents. ""We have a lot of locals coming in saying their TVs were shaking, they felt it,"" Hasty told the paper. ""No damage that I've heard of.

State congressional candidate takes a break from campaigning to help earthquake victims in Puerto Rico,2020-01-31 01:11 UTC,https://www.wtnh.com/news/international/state-congressional-candidate-takes-a-break-from-campaigning-to-help-earthquake-victims-in-puerto-rico/,"WTNH.com Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       (WTNH) — The 5th District Congressional seat in Connecticut – currently held by Jahana Hayes (D) – is up for grabs this year. But despite the fact that the election is less than a year away, one candidate is taking a break from campaigning to help residents living in earthquake-ravaged Puerto Rico. Less than a month after a magnitude 6 earthquake rocked Puerto Rico, recovery assistance is still desperately needed. Ruban Rodriquez, the Director of Connecticut’s American Latino Coalition, and a Republican candidate for Connecticut’s 5th District, recently visited the island and says “when you go there personally and you see with your own eyes what is going on there, it is heartbreaking.” Rodriquez told News 8 the most difficult part is seeing families and knowing they lost everything. Not in one day – but in ten seconds. On his visit to the island, Rodriquez worked with the non-profit ‘Helping Hands’ to bring 16 pallets of water, food, baby diapers, and clothes for families affected, including his own. Just got another 4 pallets of water for Peñuelas PR. We continue the work for our people in Puerto Rico. Helping hands for Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico Somos Gente working hard in the island. @SenadorCruz @NYSLatinos @wandavazquezg @AlbertorioHec Rodriquez says earthquake after-shocks continue and are fast and furious. “It just happens so fast that you don’t even have time to run outside.” Rodriquez says the focus now is making sure the kids get a proper education. The schools down there are destroyed completely. Rodriquez and his group brought 27 domes for teachers to use as classrooms so the children don’t lose the entire school year. Engineers have reportedly inspected a majority of the island’s more than 850 public schools. At least 50 were declared not safe.  Rodriquez says there is no greater calling then helping your community – even if its thousands of miles away. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

"After another Puerto Rico earthquake, the U.S. keeps ignoring 3 million Americans | Opinion",2020-01-29 14:30 UTC,https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/puerto-rico-earthquake-aid-us-territory-20200129.html,"For all that they give to our country, the Americans of Puerto Rico are so often ignored because they reside in a territory, not a state. Millions of Americans are being systematically forgotten and mistreated by our government and its leaders on a bipartisan and daily basis, lost and left behind in the latest political controversy or policy squabble. Imagine if, God forbid, the state of Iowa was hit with two Category 5 storms in the span of a few weeks that would destroy essential infrastructure, cause billions of dollars in damages, and lead to an estimated 3,000 casualties within a year. Imagine just over two years later, while Iowa is still struggling to recover from those storms and facing a multi-year humanitarian crisis, the state gets jolted by a series of earthquakes, leaving thousands without homes, electricity, and drinking water. Imagine the current Republican administration delaying, then restricting, billions of dollars in lifesaving aid to Iowa, and the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination never mentioning the state during a two-hour nationally televised debate. One would have to imagine these scenarios because this would never actually happen to the great state of Iowa — and its population of three million people, six electoral votes, and its first-in-the-nation caucuses. It would be presidential political malfeasance to forget about Iowa, especially in a presidential election year. Iowa’s two senators and four House representatives would never allow for this to happen. Our social media and 24/7 news environment would hold our national leaders accountable and just as assuredly never allow this to happen. This should never happen in 2020. Yet it is happening right now to over three million Americans in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico’s population is roughly the same as that of Iowa. After suffering through two catastrophic hurricanes in 2017 that caused great destruction, Puerto Rico has recently faced an onslaught of earthquakes that further damaged an already devastated island.  The Trump administration recently released a much-delayed and much-needed $16 billion of disaster relief and prevention aid package to Puerto Rico. However, the money came with a number of restrictions, including a bar from any amount being spent on the electric grid, despite years of rolling blackouts on the island. The funds were released after much public outcry and a series of earthquakes that crippled the island’s already damaged infrastructure. On the other side of the aisle, the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination recently held a nationally televised debate, where over the course of two hours and the discussion of numerous topics, the plight of Puerto Rico was never mentioned once. This is not to suggest that both sides of the political spectrum bear equal blame for inattention and inaction toward Puerto Rico at the national level. Rather, this is to suggest that too often, Puerto Rico is readily forgotten by our national leaders on a bipartisan basis. Puerto Rican Americans serve our country in all levels of government. They are civil servants and enlisted soldiers, congressional representatives and Senate staffers, assistant U.S. attorneys and a United States Supreme Court Justice. Yet for all that they give and sacrifice for our country, the Americans of Puerto Rico are so often ignored because they reside in a territory, not a state. American territories like Puerto Rico possess a second-rate political status relative to states. Puerto Rico does not have any U.S. senators, voting House representatives, or electors in the Electoral College, despite being more populated than 21 states. They are subject to American laws and regulations with little to no say over them. They fight and die on behalf of our country, but have no right to vote for their commander in chief. Our national leaders can do better by Puerto Rico and its people. We can remember them, account for them, and protect them like we do Iowans, Pennsylvanians, Californians, Floridians, and the citizens of all our states through our politics and policies. We can start by publicly acknowledging the serious problems facing Puerto Rico on the floors of power in Washington, D.C., as well as on the floor of a national debate stage. The Democratic Party should hold a debate or forum for its leading presidential candidates on the island to bring national attention to the issues facing Puerto Rico. We can and should provide much-needed funding, expertise, and other governmental support as quickly as possible to the island as we would if a humanitarian crisis was occurring in any of our 50 states. We can and should do better by the people of Puerto Rico, if for no other reason than the simple fact that they are our fellow Americans. And lest we need a cold political reason for doing better, we should remember that over a million former residents of Puerto Rico now live in Florida, a state with 29 votes in the Electoral College. Tom C.W. Lin is a professor of law at Temple University’s Beasley School of Law and the author of a recent California Law Review study on the plight of Puerto Rico and the other American territories."

         A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck south of Cuba and northwest of Jamaica, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It was centered about 76 miles north-northwest of Lucea, Jamaica, CBS Miami reported. There were no initial reports of damage or casualties. The quake was centered about 6 miles beneath the surface of the water. The National Weather Service initially issued a tsunami threat for the coasts of Jamaica, Belize, Cuba, Honduras, Mexico and the Cayman Islands, but called off the alert around 4 p.m. ET. There was concern there could be tsunami waves reaching about 1 to 3 feet above the tide level. The quake was so powerful some Miami residents felt their buildings shake. ""I was sitting at my desk in Aventura, I felt motion similar to feeling light-headed,"" a resident who asked to remain anonymous told CBS Miami. ""It didn't stop and my coworker asked if the building was moving."" A CBS Miami chopper flew over buildings as hundreds of people were apparently evacuating into the streets.   The Stephen P. Clark building in downtown Miami has also been closed as a precaution, police said. They said some buildings in the Brickell area were evacuated, but there were no reported injuries and there are no road closures. Raquel Perez, an employee at the Don Soffer Clinical Research Center on the University of Miami Medical Campus was on the seventh floor when she felt the quake. ""Not everyone noticed it in my office. I was sitting at my desk and felt my chair swaying. Then, I noticed the cords of our window blinds swaying back and forth. It didn't look like it was windy outside, so I couldn't figure out why the building was swaying, but it was,"" Perez told CBS Miami. ""It actually made me a little dizzy. Ten minutes later, someone in our office said they also felt movement and found a report online of an earthquake,"" she added.    Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved."

Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, speaking at a televized news conference near the epicenter of the quake, said 39 people had been rescued from the rubble of collapsed buildings, including a woman recovered 14 hours after the main tremor. Rescue workers were continuing to search for people buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings in Elazig province and neighboring Malatya, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said earlier. Emergency workers and security forces distributed tents, beds and blankets as overnight temperatures dropped below freezing in the affected areas. Mosques, schools, sports halls and student dormitories were opened for hundreds who left their homes after the quake. Advertisement “The earthquake was very severe, we desperately ran out (of our home),” Emre Gocer told the state-run Anadolu news agency as he sheltered with his family at a sports hall in the town of Sivrice in Elazig. “We don’t have a safe place to stay right now.”  AFAD said it was followed by 228 aftershocks, the strongest with magnitudes 5.4 and 5.1. At least five buildings in Sivrice and 25 in Malatya province were destroyed, said Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum. Hundreds of other structures were damaged and made unsafe. Soylu said 18 people were killed in Elazig and four in Malatya. Some 1,030 people were hurt. Speaking at the same news conference, Koca said 34 people remain in intensive care. Television footage showed emergency workers removing two people from the wreckage of a collapsed building in the town of Gezin. Another person was saved in the city of Elazig, the provincial capital, and two more from a house in Doganyol, Malatya. Advertisement A prison in Adiyaman, 110 kilometers (70 miles) southwest of the epicenter, was evacuated after being damaged in the quake. AFAD said 28 rescue teams had been working around the clock. More than 2,600 personnel from 39 of Turkey’s 81 provinces were sent to the disaster site. “Our biggest hope is that the death toll does not rise,” Parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop said. Communication companies announced free telephone and internet services for residents in the quake-hit region, while Turkish Airlines announced extra flights. Soylu said emergency work was proceeding under the threat of aftershocks. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Twitter overnight that all measures were being taken to ""ensure that the earthquake that occurred in Elazig and was felt in many provinces is overcome with the least amount of loss."" Neighboring Greece, which is at odds with Turkey over maritime boundaries and gas exploitation rights, offered to send rescue crews should they be needed. Elazig is some 565 kilometers (350 miles) east of the Turkish capital, Ankara. Turkey sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent. Two strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey in 1999, killing around 18,000 people. A magnitude 6 earthquake killed 51 people in Elazig in 2010.

LOCALS STEP UP FOR PUERTO RICAN EARTHQUAKE RELIEF,2020-01-23 05:01 UTC,https://www.rocklandtimes.com/2020/01/23/locals-step-up-for-puerto-rican-earthquake-relief/,
Earthquake-damaged buildings cripple Puerto Rico,2020-01-17 05:13 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/16/us/puerto-rico-earthquake-damaged-buildings/index.html,"
      The Ponciana Condominium building here is one of the most distinctive in the island’s second-largest city. It’s a 12-story structure, just south of downtown, with medical and commercial units on its first three floors and residential units on the remaining nine.
   
      But after a series of tremors and aftershocks that have rattled Puerto Rico’s southern coast since December 28, the tower now sits empty. 
   
      Ponce authorities declared it uninhabitable shortly after a mandatory evacuation prompted by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake left cracks and fissures on three sides of the building. Ivette Campos says her elderly aunt was one of those residents who were quickly evacuated.
   
      “They kicked all the residents out as well as people in the doctors’ offices, and nobody truly knows what’s going to happen with the building,” Campos said.
   
      Mayor María E. Meléndez said that there are areas in Ponce that “were severely affected and we estimate the damage to be above $200 million, in addition to the losses sustained by businesses that have had to shut their doors.”
   
      The Ponciana is one of 23 condominium buildings in Ponce that have sustained structural damage, according to Ángel Vázquez Torres, the local emergency management agency’s director.
   
      Vázquez told CNN the same happened with an additional 404 houses in the city.
    
      The fear is that if there’s another major earthquake, some of these structures may collapse, trapping residents or worse.
   
      “Our structural engineers evaluated those sites and indicated to us which ones we had to declare uninhabitable, and we’re trying to keep people away from them,” Vázquez told CNN.
   
      Authorities say there also are countless buildings and houses that may have sustained damage that is not visible during the nearly three weeks of daily tremors and aftershocks that have happened in Ponce and towns located on the island’s southern coast.
    
      The work of detecting the damage in Ponce, Guánica, Guayanilla and Yauco is only beginning.
   
      It’s another great challenge for Puerto Rico, a US territory that has yet to recover from the devastating effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which killed nearly 3,000 in September 2017.
   
      Buildings that had been damaged by the hurricanes simply collapsed or were left in worse shape by the earthquakes and aftershocks. The same happened to other infrastructure, such as roads and bridges.
   
      Deciding what to do next with damaged buildings is still an open question for Puerto Rico. Repairs will be costly and demolishing houses and buildings declared uninhabitable will also cost millions of dollars.
   
      After days of waiting, the island got some good news about funding to begin the recovery process. President Donald Trump on Thursday afternoon approved a declaration of a major disaster in Puerto Rico.
   
      The declaration provides federal funding for six municipalities on the southern coast.
   
      Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced expressed gratitude. “We thank the @POTUS for his commitment helping relieve the suffering of our fellow citizens.”
   
      Alex Amparo, the top official in the region for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), describes the challenge Puerto Rico now faces in military terms.
   
      “We’re in a constant battle, I mean, we’re in a fight right now.  The ground is still shaking. I think you saw earlier we had a 5.2 and at the same time we have people who have lost homes,” Amparo said.
   
      While the full extent of the damage continues to be assessed, authorities have to take care of more pressing needs. 
   
      There are currently 30 shelters on Puerto Rico’s southern coast, holding 8,023 people who were affected by the earthquakes.
   
      Shelters in the cities of Yauco, Peñuelas, Guánica, Guayanilla and Ponce provide food, showers, air-conditioned rest areas, psychological counseling and medical services.
   
      Some of those displaced are residents who are too afraid to return home for fear a wall or the roof will collapse.
   
      But many others are families whose homes are now in ruins, people who are wondering whether they will receive housing assistance from the government or whether they will have to fend for themselves.
   
      Luis Vélez told CNN that he and his extended family of more than 20 people, including a disabled uncle, have been living at a shelter opened by local authorities at Ponce Vocational School. 
   
      “We’re going to stay here until the ground stops shaking,” Vélez said. “We got back on our feet after Hurricane María and, with God’s help, we will do the same after this series of earthquakes is over.”

But, earlier this week, he said he lived through a nightmare and he shared his story exclusively with News 8. “You feel helpless because what do I do?” Lopez said. “My family’s all around me. If something happens what do I do? I can’t protect them.” Lopez and his family were visiting relatives in Puerto Rico when the earthquake hit after 4 a.m. Tuesday. They were all asleep. “It sounded like a roar,” he said. “It was like the devil. It was unbelievable. That’s what woke us up. Then the house…just like someone picked it up and just shook it.” The next day, he and his family were in the car racing towards the airport to try and get back to Waterbury. But, Lopez said falling rocks were tumbling from mountainsides onto Puerto Rico’s main highway. “It’s terrifying,” he said. Along the way, he passed houses and cars that sustained a lot of damage. Fortunately, his relatives’ house was not significantly damaged.   Now that he’s back safe in Waterbury, he sees himself getting involved in a possible effort to help the people of Puerto Rico recover from yet another blow from Mother Nature. “We’re going to try to do what we can to do our part,” he said.

Puerto Rico Earthquake Aftermath Worsens; Government Overwhelmed,2020-01-10 08:47 UTC,https://www.voanews.com/usa/puerto-rico-earthquake-aftermath-worsens-government-overwhelmed,"

 GUAYANILLA, Puerto Rico — More than 2,000 people in shelters. Nearly 1 million without power. Hundreds of thousands without water. The aftermath of a 6.4-magnitude earthquake that killed one person, injured nine others and severely damaged infrastructure in Puerto Rico’s southwest coast is deepening as the island’s government says it is overwhelmed. Many in the affected area are comparing the situation to Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that hit in September 2017, as hundreds of families who are unable to return to their damaged homes wonder where they’ll stay in upcoming weeks and months as hope fades of electricity being restored soon. “We have to remain outside because everything inside is destroyed,” said 84-year-old Brunilda Sanchez, who has been sleeping outdoors in a government-supplied cot in the southwest coastal town of Guanica. “We don’t know how long we’ll have to stay here.” Trump declares emergency U.S. President Donald Trump declared an emergency in Puerto Rico several hours after Tuesday’s quake hit, a move that frees up federal funds via the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency for things ranging from transportation to medical care to mobile generators. But some local officials worry the help won’t arrive soon enough. “FEMA is a very bureaucratic agency and it moves very slowly. So slowly that we’re still waiting for federal funds from Maria,” Daniel Hernandez, director of generation for Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, told The Associated Press. He said FEMA has pledged to bring mobile generators to bolster the company’s biggest plant, which is near the island’s southern coast where the quake hit and is severely damaged. Hernandez said it’s unclear how quickly the plant can be repaired, noting that a damage assessment is ongoing, although some officials estimated it could take up to one year to repair. Complicating efforts to restore power are strong aftershocks, with more than 40 earthquakes with a 3.0-magnitude or higher occurring since Tuesday’s quake, according to experts. Every time it shakes, personnel have to evacuate and further damage to the plant’s infrastructure is feared, Hernandez said. Power company director Jose Ortiz said he expects nearly all customers to have electricity by early next week, adding that extremely preliminary assessments show that at least $50 million in damage occurred. Highway closes, aftershocks fill shelters On Thursday, transportation officials closed a portion of one of Puerto Rico’s busiest highways because of what they called serious structural failures related to the quake. Both directions of Highway 52 that runs from the capital of San Juan to the southern coastal city of Ponce were indefinitely closed near Ponce. Meanwhile, those aftershocks have led to a rise in the number of people seeking shelter in southwest Puerto Rico as government officials continue to inspect homes and public housing complexes. Fernando Gil, secretary of Puerto Rico’s Housing Department, urged people to stay with family or in shelters if they felt unsafe in their homes as the government relocated more than two dozen people from damaged residences. “Meanwhile, we will continue to identify what kind of help is needed to support all affected families,” he said. Schools damaged The future of hundreds of schoolchildren in the island’s southwest region also is uncertain as officials delayed the start of classes that was scheduled for Thursday. A three-story school in Guanica that houses nearly 450 children alone saw its first two floors flattened by the quake. There were no children in the school at the time. Education officials said 24 schools were affected by the quake but that teams of engineers were inspecting all of the island’s schools. They said it’s too early to say when classes might start. While officials say it’s too early to provide an estimate of total damage, they say hundreds of homes and businesses were affected by Tuesday’s quake and the 5.8-magnitude one that preceded it on Monday. Teresa Arroyo, a 47-year-old resident of the southern town of Penuelas, said her home is heavily damaged but she plans to stay there. “Where else am I supposed to go?” she said. “Everyone is depressed. This is serious.” "

         Guánica, Puerto Rico — A 5.8-magnitude quake hit Puerto Rico before dawn Monday, unleashing small landslides, causing power outages and severely cracking some homes. It was one of the strongest quakes yet to hit the U.S. territory that has been shaking for the past week. There were no immediate reports of casualties but there was significant damage in the town of Guánica. An Associated Press photographer captured an image of at least two vehicles crushed by a house that collapsed in the earthquake.   Residents took to social media to report the ""strong temblor.""  Triste despertar para familia que acaba de perder su casa a causa de el fuerte sismo que ocurrió hoy en el sur de Puerto Rico. Gracias a Dios estas personas y sus hijos están bien. pic.twitter.com/REcucvTuYY Power outages were reported in some parts of Puerto Rico following the quake, Angel Vazquez, emergency management director for the southern coastal city of Ponce, told The Associated Press. ""This is one of the strongest quakes to date since it started shaking on Dec. 28,"" he said. ""It lasted a long time."" Helicopters buzzed overhead as terrified residents jumped up from their folding chairs every time the earth shook, yelling at others to stay away from power lines. Few people dared go back inside their homes, but José Quiñones, 54, had no choice. His 80-year-old mother had heart problems and was lying in bed. Dozens of people in a neighborhood called Hope in the southwest town of Guánica walked around with their phones and yelled out the magnitude of the latest earthquakes as they tried to calm children who were forced to open their presents on Three Kings Day, a religious holiday, on streets and sidewalks. ""This is hell,"" said Alberto Rodríguez, 43, whose home collapsed on its side as the smell of gas filled the air. ""We haven't slept... you can't remain calm here. Guánica is no longer a safe place."" Less than a block away, Silvestre Alicea surveyed his home whose foundation collapsed on his bright blue 1977 Toyota Corolla, a prized possession. He jumped from his balcony as the home collapsed. Alicea had lived in New York for years until he retired to Guánica two years ago to live in the home he spent 15 years building. He doesn't have insurance. In this working class neighborhood, people shared soda and snacks as they sought shelter from a harsh sun, careful to stay away from homes whose columns and foundations were heavily cracked. At a hotel in the southwest coastal town of Guanica, people panicked as they tried to flee in their cars, only to realize that large boulders were obstructing the only highway heading north to the capital of San Juan, attorney Jose Francisco Benitez told the AP. ""There was a state of panic,"" he said. ""There were even people in their underwear walking around the hotel."" Many already had bags packed in their cars with a change of clothes, food, water and medicine.  Some like Noelia De Jesús, 69, and her husband, who uses a wheelchair, didn't know where they would spend the night. Government officials who inspected their home earlier in the morning said it was unsafe to live in and advised them to stay elsewhere. ""Everything broke, including the TV,"" she said. ""This is horrible."" Puerto Rico doesn't have a public earthquake warning system, except for sirens that are supposed to ring in case of a tsunami. Residents in this neighborhood criticized the government for what they believe is a lack of action. Dr. Sindia Alvarado, who lives in the southern coastal town of Penuelas, said she was petrified. ""My entire family woke up screaming,"" she said. ""I though the house was going to crack in half."" The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico's southern region began the night of Dec. 28, with quakes ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to 5.1. Previous quakes of lesser magnitudes in recent days have cracked homes and led to goods falling off supermarket shelves.  One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a 7.3-magnitude quake struck near the island's northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.

         A minor earthquake struck off the coast of Massachusetts on Sunday morning, rattling buildings across southern New England but causing no reports of damage or injuries. The magnitude 4.0 quake struck about 5.5 miles off the coast of Bliss Corner, Massachusetts, in Buzzards Bay  shortly after 9 a.m. Sunday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, the federal agency that tracks earthquakes. It struck at a depth of about 9 miles. Residents on Cape Cod and across much of eastern Massachusetts reported feeling the earthquake shortly after it struck, CBS Boston reports, adding that there have been no indications of damage.

(KOLD News 13) - Numbers keep adding up and the amount of fatalities due to the earthquake in Turkey, on Friday, is now over 30 and the number of people injured is well over 700. Turkish authorties continue to search under rubble and under collapsed buildings for victims. On Saturday, Oct. 31, rescue teams lifted a teenager out of the remnants of a devastated apartment block. The earthquake’s epicenter was traced to the coast of the Aegean Sea and it’s magnitude, according to Turkish authorities, measured 6.6 on the Richter Scale. Other seismology experts said it measured 6.9. The earthquake toppled buildings in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, and triggered a small tsunami in the Seferihisar district and on the Greek island of Samos.  Many people spent the night out in the streets, too frightened to return to their homes, even if they sustained no damage- due to the hundreds of aftershcoks that followed the main event. Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Copyright 2020 KOLD News 13. All rights reserved."
Major Earthquake Retrofit Work Complete At Lake Merced Pump Station,2020-10-17 00:51 UTC,https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/10/16/hetch-hetchy-earthquake-retrofit-lake-merced-pump-station/,"Watch CBS News

          / CBS San Francisco
         SAN FRANCISCO (KPIX 5) -- It all started with a 2002 state law demanding quake-resilient water delivery. Nearly $5 billion later, San Francisco has retrofit the system from Hetch Hetchy to the city, just now crossing the finish line on the shore of Lake Merced. ""We take water from elevation here of approximately 30 feet, and we boost it to an elevation of 385 feet for Sunset Reservoir and 495.5 feet for Twin Peaks Reservoir,"" said Brahman Conci, Operations Superintendent at the Lake Merced Pump Station. Seventy million gallons a day can move through these pumps. And now, the station that houses them feels more like a bunker, complete with a high-pressure, epoxy grout injection foundation. ""So this facility was rebuilt,"" Conci explained. ""And was seismically hardened. ""And then the facilities themselves are generally designed to withstand about a 7.0 magnitude earthquake,"" Conci went on to say. And for everything, there is redundancy, from the pumps to the power, with two 2-megawatt generators that are used to operate the pumps when we lose utility power. The facility can also manage all of the city's water systems including the high-pressure tanks used during major fires like the one by Van Ness back in July. ""We used our Jones Street tank, and we went up to our Ashberry Street tank, and now we're flowing water all the way from Twin Peaks, all the way down here,"" SFFD Deputy Chief of Operations Victor Wyrsch said about that day, describing the reliance on the city's emergency system. If absolutely necessary, the pump station itself can become a redundancy for firefighters, with the ability to pull from the 2.2 billion gallons of water in Lake Merced. ""We would start one of these pumps, and allow us to pump that lake water to either Sunset reservoir or Sutro Reservoir for fire suppression,"" Conci said of the emergency scenario. ""In the event we did that, that is a non-potable source that you've now put into a potable source so it will change the potability. We would have to issue a boil water order."" Conci described it as ""the nuclear option."" As for the reservoirs, they have been rebuilt as well over the past 20 years. The city says its water system is now ready for whatever is coming.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the temblor was centered 1.86 miles southwest of Yorba Linda at a depth of 5.46 miles.  According to seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones, the quakes were not on any of the big mapped faults. If you felt ""2 sharp jolts"", you were feeling the P and S waves. The time between them tells you how far you are from the hypocenter. Distance = 5 miles x (S-P time). If they were 1 seconds apart, you are 5 miles away - including depth. Since it was 5 miles deep, you'd be on it. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

         A 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Magna, Utah, Wednesday morning, according to the United States Geological Survey. The temblor knocked out power for tens of thousands and operations at Salt Lake City International Airport came to a halt. It is the largest earthquake to hit the state since a 5.9 magnitude quake struck southern Utah in 1992, according to Utah Emergency Management.The quake  was felt across Salt Lake County and in Ogden and as far away as Wyoming, CBS affiliate KUTV reports.  Utah Governor Gary Herbert asked people on Twitter to stay away from Salt Lake City's downtown area ""while crews assess damage,"" unless they work in public safety, or are an essential employee. According to the governor, the earthquake damaged both the state's department of health lab and its coronavirus hotline.  ""The (Utah Department of Health) state lab is assessing damage and currently down. The poison control center has been evacuated and the (Utah Coronavirus) hotline is down,"" Herbert tweeted Wednesday. Utah has 51 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins.  No deaths or injuries have been reported but KUTV aired footage showing damage in downtown Salt Lake City early Wednesday. Our @KUTVMorgan is live on @KUTV2News showing #earthquake damage in downtown Salt Lake City. pic.twitter.com/PSGtlF25Gc Rocky Mountain Power tweeted around 8 a.m. local time that it is aware of a ""large scale power outage in the Salt Lake Valley Area impacting approximately 55,000 customers"" due to the earthquake.  ""We currently are assessing damages and will restore power as soon as possible,"" the utility said.  Salt Lake City International Airport said in a tweet the road to the airport was closed following the quake. ""Please do not come out to the airport,"" it tweeted. The Federal Aviation Association released a statement saying it had evacuated the airport's control tower, and had issued a ""ground stop"" order to divert any inbound air traffic to other airports.  Airport authority is currently conducting a ""runway inspection,"" according to the FAA.  ""The Salt Lake City International Airport is currently not operational.

At least 11 aftershocks, coming about two to four minutes apart, had been felt by 8 a.m. local time in the Salt Lake City area.  According to the U.S. Geological Survey, since the initial earthquake there have been eight magnitude three or higher earthquakes, which are strong enough to be felt. The USGS aftershock forecast predicts that over the next week ""there is a 6% chance of one or more aftershocks that are larger than magnitude 5.7."" A series of smaller aftershocks, magnitude 3 or higher, are also likely.  ""The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily,"" according to USGS.

Millions Going Hungry in Haiti 10 Years After Devastating Earthquake,2020-01-18 17:50 UTC,https://www.voanews.com/americas/millions-going-hungry-haiti-10-years-after-devastating-earthquake,"

 The World Food Program is appealing for $62 million to provide life-saving food assistance over the next six months to 700,000 people suffering from severe hunger in the Caribbean island of Haiti. Millions of Haitians still lack proper shelter, food and other basic necessities 10 years after a devastating earthquake killed 300,000 people and displaced one-and-one-half-million. The World Food Program says one in three Haitians need urgent food assistance in both rural and urban areas. It says one million of them are suffering from severe hunger, causing rates of acute malnutrition to rise.  WFP spokeswoman Elizabeth Byrs says her agency is scaling up its operation to provide emergency food aid to hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable people.  “Ten years after the earthquake, WFP is still concerned about a decline in food security, with 3.7 million people severely food insecure and affected also by rising prices, drop in agricultural production, and social unrest, of course, which has heavily disrupted economic activity in Haiti,” Byrs said. Anti-government riots last year disrupted the ability of humanitarian agencies to bring food and other aid to people in the impoverished country. Byrs says the WFP responded to this emergency by providing food to more than 230,000 of the most vulnerable. She says it also furnished 300,000 school children with daily food, including hot meals. Byrs says donors have contributed $5 million since WFP launched its emergency appeal in December. That means the agency still needs $57 million to continue its life-saving operation for the next six months.   "

Public health emergency declared in Puerto Rico after deadly earthquake and aftershocks,2020-01-09 17:37 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/09/us/puerto-rico-earthquake-thursday/index.html,"
      Power is expected to be slowly restored to all homes in Puerto Rico over the coming days in the aftermath of a 6.4 magnitude earthquake that left many residents sleeping outside their homes and more than 2,000 others in shelters.
   
      The strongest and likely most damaging of hundreds of temblors that have struck the island since December 28 hit before dawn Tuesday. It left one man dead and caused dozens of homes and other structures to crumble. 
   
      With three major power plants expected to return to service between Thursday and Saturday, Puerto Rico Electric Energy Authority CEO Jose Ortiz said the entire US territory – with about 3 million residents – could have power by the weekend. A fourth plant could begin operating by Sunday, he said. 
   
      “The target is for Saturday to have everybody with power,” Ortiz told CNN Thursday. 
   
      Power has now been restored to about 700,000 of Puerto Rico’s 1.4 million utility customers across the island, according to Ortiz. 
   
      For many Puerto Ricans still rebuilding after 2017’s Hurricane Maria claimed thousands of lives and left much of the island in the dark for months, the uncertainly following the latest disaster recalls the post-storm trauma. 
    
      “We are concerned about potential impacts of this week’s earthquakes on the lives of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico. Across HHS, we have worked closely with the territory’s health and human services authorities on disaster recovery and will continue to do everything we can to help ensure the health and well-being of people across the island,” he said. 
    
      Tuesday’s earthquake was centered off Puerto Rico’s southern coast, six miles south of Indios. Terrified of sleeping indoors as aftershocks continue, neighbors put mattresses in their front yards while others spent the night under white tents and tarps. 
    
      Noelia de Jesus has been sleeping at an outdoors shelter with her granddaughters, terrified of returning to her home in Guanica.
   
      It’s the third time that a natural disaster leaves her without a place to live. Like her, many Puerto Ricans lost their homes when Hurricane Maria hit and Hurricane George struck in 1998.
   
      The Puerto Rico Department of Housing said  2,204 people have sought refuge in 18 shelters. 
   
      Residents and officials have repeatedly said the impact from the quakes surpasses the devastation that Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm when it hit the island, delivered two years ago. 
   
      “With the hurricane, you knew when and at what time it would arrive,” Guayanilla resident Tatiana Rodriguez, 28, said, adding of the quakes, “This, you don’t know at what time it’s going to happen.”
   
      The town of 18,000 located near the southern coast hasn’t been getting regular updates, she said. Residents are disinclined to leave their homes because they don’t know what areas are safe. Rodriguez worries that recovery will be difficult, especially for those hit hard by Maria, she said. 
   
      “There are a lot of people that started from zero because of Maria,” she said. “(They’re) starting again from zero.”
   
      Classes won’t resume across the island until crews inspect all schools and confirm buildings are safe for students, education officials announced.
   
      The Agripina Seda School in Guanica suffered major damage, including a partially collapsed, three-story building. 
   
      “Classes in the public school system won’t resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,” Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won’t return to the schools until further notice. 
   
      The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced aid has been made available to supplement local response efforts.
   
      President Donald Trump’s action authorizes FEMA to coordinate all disaster relief efforts and provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures to save lives and protect property.

          / CBS News
         Around a third of Puerto Rico's population remains in the dark amid a series of earthquakes. The island's power authority said 600,000 customers have power, but around 900,000 people still don't know when the lights will return. The power plant in Guayanilla   that generates more than a quarter of the island's power has been severely damaged, and there's disagreement about when it will be back up and running. ""You can see that most of the structure is compromised,"" Angel Perez, the operations manager at the Costa Sur Power Plant, told CBS News correspondent David Begnaud. Tanks used to clean water, the first step in the energy generation process, were knocked over inside the plant. Without those tanks, ""we cannot even think to provide power to anybody,"" Perez said. From those tanks, the water would be sent to even larger tanks outside the plant, which Perez said have also been damaged. ""There is a fracture in the middle, in the base of the tank,"" he said. There also was damage to a control room and a turbine. And with Costa Sur not generating any energy, hundreds of thousands of people could go without power. ""What's the reality? Do you think people are going to have to sort of get used to having power maybe half the day and not having it the other half?"" Begnaud asked Perez. ""We are going to work 24 hours around the clock,"" Perez said. Pressed to be as realistic as possible, Perez said, ""No less than a month.""  But Jose Ortiz, the CEO of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, said the plant ""will be out for probably over a year."" ""How much of this is earthquake-related or how much is it just old equipment that hasn't been cared for and updated?"" Begnaud asked. ""It's both really. To be honest, those plants have over 60 years basically,"" Ortiz said. ""Imagine you have a taxi, 60 years old, and you are required to run that 24/7. That's the kind of business we're running."" When people in Puerto Rico heard Ortiz say it could take a year before the plant was running again, there was a trending hashtag on Twitter calling for him to resign.  Ortiz said he's asking FEMA to supply a special generator that would provide 500 megawatts of electricity, which is more than half of what this entire plant can provide. But as of right now, the emergency declaration President Donald Trump signed doesn't allow FEMA to provide the generators that are needed here.   Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

The agency initially said the quake's strength was 6.2 and 108 kilometers deep. In the coastal city of Calatagan, about 90 kilometers south of Manila and near the epicenter, people attending Mass remained calm as the earthquake hit, police chief Major Carlo Caceres told AFP. ""There was a pause in the church service, but the people did not panic,"" Caceres said. ""This area is quake-prone and people are more or less used to them."" There were no reports of damage or casualties in the area, he added. ""The office furniture and equipment swayed, but nothing was broken,"" said policeman Allan Megano in the nearby town of Balayan.

16-Foot 'Earthquake Fish' Caught After Quakes Strike Coast of Taiwan,2020-12-04 10:40 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/16-foot-earthquake-fish-caught-after-quakes-strike-coast-of-taiwan_3586728.html,"On the same day that two earthquakes hit the coast of eastern Taiwan, a fisherman caught a humungous oarfish measuring over 16 feet (approx. 5 meters) in length. The species is dubbed “earthquake fish” for its habit of rising from the depths before a quake. The impressive catch was sold to a local seafood restaurant. After reeling in the massive oarfish off the Dong’ao coast of Taiwan’s Yilan County on Nov. 6, the fisherman logged its weight as around 99.2 pounds (approx. 45 kg). Chen Kuo-pin, the owner of Fumei Huo Seafood Restaurant, who purchased the fish for 16,000 New Taiwan dollars (US$566), told Liberty Times it was the longest earthquake fish he had ever seen. Local fishermen attested to his statement. Chen explained that fishermen usually cast their nets between early morning and late evening but speculated that the 16-foot behemoth had likely been caught at nighttime. Deep-sea fish do not survive long in tanks or shallow water; fishermen nonetheless claimed that the oarfish was alive when they docked with their trophy catch. Chen, a restaurateur of 55 years, said oarfish are not uncommon in the area. However, most oarfish measure between 3 and 6.5 feet (approx. 1 and 2 meters) in length. The 16-foot beauty, he claimed, was “very rare.” Posting about the epic catch on Facebook, Fumei Huo Seafood Restaurant staffers announced, “Everyone is welcome to come and take pictures and check in.” The oarfish—scientific name Regalecus glesne—is allegedly the world’s longest bony fish, according to National Geographic. It eats tiny plankton, lacks scales, and is completely harmless to humans. The two earthquakes on Nov. 6 that precipitated the 16-foot Taiwanese oarfish’s rise from the deep sea registered a magnitude of 5.4, according to Central Weather Bureau data. Chen’s customers were reportedly blown away by the size of the restaurateur’s purchase. One kilogram (approx. two pounds) of delicate oarfish meat can sell for up to 400 New Taiwan dollars (US$14), Chen told Liberty Times. The meat, he said, is “more tender than tofu,” and is soft enough to be eaten with a spoon after steaming.

Rescuers Pull Girl Alive From Collapsed Apartment 4 Days After Earthquake in Turkey,2020-11-06 08:57 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/rescuers-pull-girl-alive-from-collapsed-apartment-4-days-after-earthquake-in-turkey_3567634.html,"Rescuers in the Turkish city of Izmir pulled a young girl out alive from the rubble of a collapsed apartment building Tuesday, four days after a strong earthquake hit Turkey and Greece and as hopes of reaching survivors began to fade. Wrapped in a thermal blanket, the girl was taken into an ambulance on a stretcher to the sounds of applause and chants of “God is great!” from rescue workers and onlookers. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca identified her as 3-year-old Ayda Gezgin on Twitter. The child had been trapped inside the rubble for 91 hours since Friday’s quake struck in the Aegean Sea and was the 107th person to have been pulled out of collapsed buildings alive. After she was pulled from the rubble, little Ayda called out for her mother in video of the rescue broadcast on television. But Ayda’s mother did not survive. Her body was found amid the wreckage hours later. Her brother and father were not inside the building at the time of the quake. Rescuer Nusret Aksoy told reporters that he was sifting through the rubble of the toppled eight-floor building when he heard a child’s scream and called for silence. He later located the girl in a tight space next to a dishwasher. The girl waved at him, told him her name, and said that she was okay, Aksoy said. “I got goosebumps and my colleague Ahmet cried,” he told HaberTurk television.  Health ministry officials said the girl was in good condition but would be kept under observation in the hospital for a while. She asked for meatballs and a yogurt drink on her way to the hospital, state-run Anadolu Agency reported. Her rescue came a day after another 3-year-old girl and a 14-year-old girl were also pulled out alive from collapsed buildings in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city. “We will not lose hope (about finding survivors) until our search-and-rescue efforts reach the last person under the wreck,” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said following a Cabinet meeting. Erdogan said around 6,700 people who lost their homes or were too frightened to return to them were being temporarily housed in tents. Authorities on Tuesday began assembling container homes for the survivors, he added. Meanwhile, the death toll in the earthquake climbed to 112 after emergency crews retrieved more bodies from toppled buildings in the city. Officials said 138 quake survivors were still hospitalized, and three of them were in serious condition. The U.S. Geological Survey registered the quake’s magnitude at 7.0, though other agencies recorded it as less severe. The vast majority of the deaths and some 1,000 injuries occurred in Izmir. Two teenagers also died and 19 people were injured on the Greek island of Samos, near the quake’s epicenter in the Aegean Sea. The quake also triggered a small tsunami that hit Samos and the Seferihisar district of Izmir Province, where one elderly woman drowned. The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul, as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Hundreds of aftershocks followed. In Izmir, the quake reduced buildings to rubble or saw floors pancake in on themselves; authorities detained nine people, including contractors, for questioning over the collapse of six of the buildings. Turkey has a mix of older buildings and cheap or illegal constructions that do not withstand earthquakes well. Regulations have been tightened to strengthen or demolish older buildings, and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities, but experts say it is not happening fast enough. The country sits on top of two major fault lines, and earthquakes are frequent. Suzan Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey."
"Video shows WWII ""earthquake bomb"" exploding in channel near Baltic Sea",2020-10-14 12:26 UTC,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/world-war-ii-earthquake-bomb-explodes-defusal-poland/,"Watch CBS News 
October 14, 2020 / 8:26 AM
          / CBS/AFP
         A massive World War II bomb exploded during a delicate operation on Tuesday to defuse the five-ton device in a channel near the Baltic Sea but no one was harmed, Polish officials said. The device — nicknamed ""Tallboy"" and also known as an ""earthquake bomb"" — was dropped by the Royal Air Force in an attack on a Nazi warship in 1945. Dramatic drone video shows the detonation spewing water hundreds of feet into the sky, with waves hitting the shore.  It was discovered last year embedded at a depth of 39 feet with just its nose sticking out during dredging close to the port city of Swinoujscie in northwest Poland. More than 6 meters long, it was laden with 2.4 tons of explosives — equivalent to around 3.6 tons of TNT. The navy had said earlier it had ruled out the traditional option of a controlled explosion for fear of destroying a bridge located some 500 meters away. Naval forces used a remote-controlled device to try to ""deflagrate"" the bomb — a technique that if successful burns the explosive charge without causing a detonation, the BBC's Adam Easton reported from Warsaw.   But in the end ""the deflagration process turned into a detonation,"" said Grzegorz Lewandowski, spokesman for the Polish navy's 8th Coastal Defence Flotilla based in Swinoujscie. ""There had been no risk to the individuals directly involved,"" he said, adding that the bomb ""can be considered neutralized."" A Swinoujscie city hall spokesman told AFP he had not heard any reports of anyone injured during the operation by military divers, nor of any damage done to the city's infrastructure. Before the operation began this week, Lewandowski had called it ""a very delicate job,"" adding that ""the tiniest vibration could detonate the bomb"". Around 750 local residents had been urged beforehand to evacuate from an area of 1.6 miles around the bomb, though some had told AFP they would be staying put. Halina Paszkowska had said the ""main danger"" for her was the risk of catching COVID-19 in a sports hall where residents were given shelter during the operation. ""I've lived here 50 years and there have been other bombs, but this is the first time there's an evacuation! Before, we just had to stay indoors,"" she said. Maritime traffic on the navigation channel and surrounding waterways had also been suspended in an area of 16 kilometres around the bomb disposal operation. During World War II, Swinoujscie — at the time Swinemuende, a part of Germany — was home to one of the German navy's most important Baltic bases and was subjected to massive bombardments, said historian Piotr Laskowski, the author of a book on the Royal Air Force raid on Germany's Luetzow cruiser in April 1945. The ship's cannons were being used to hold back the advance of the Red Army in the dying days of the war. On April 16, 1945, the RAF sent 18 Lancaster bombers from the 617th Squadron, known as the ""Dambusters"". The bombers attacked the Luetzow with 12 Tallboys, including the one that failed to explode at the time. Tallboys were designed to explode underground next to a target, triggering shock waves that would cause destruction.   Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved."

Upgrades on 45.5 miles of US Highway 6 and State Route 360 in Esmeralda and Mineral counties will begin on Monday and extend into October. The repaving project will bring longer life to the roads in the form of “chip and scrub seal” treatment, according to the Nevada Department of Transportation. US 6 and SR 360 carry a lot of heavy truck traffic — 450-700 vehicles every day — and the roads served as a detour during on US 95 during road work after a 6.5-magnitude earthquake in the region. “Chip sealing combines layers of asphalt and fine aggregates that helps curtail further roadway deterioration for a smoother and safer driving experience,” said NDOT spokesman Tony Illia. “It’s a cost-effective maintenance solution that extends the highway’s lifecycle.”  A flagger and pilot operation will safely escort motorists through active construction work zones, resulting in minor travel delays.

David Boruchowitz told KSNV-TV in Las Vegas. “Other than that, just a bunch of people shaken up.’’ The quake occurred in a remote area of the state between Reno and Las Vegas, and people from Salt Lake City, Utah, to California’s Central Valley tweeted that they felt it. “It really shook a lot of groceries off the shelves,” Keith Hasty, an employee at a gas station in Tonopah, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Hasty said residents who frequented the store were all talking about the quake. “We have a lot of locals coming in saying their TVs were shaking, they felt it,” said Hasty. “No damage that I’ve heard of.

Scientists closely monitor underwater volcano off Hawaii after rare earthquake swarm,2020-05-13 20:29 UTC,https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2020/05/13/scientists-closely-monitor-underwater-volcano-off-hawaii-after-rare-earthquake-swarm/,"HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Volcanologists are keeping a close eye on their instruments after a rare earthquake swarm off the Big Island the past two days. Twenty miles off the southeast coast of the Big Island, Hawaii’s newest volcano rises 10,000 feet from the ocean floor with its summit about 3,000 feet under the surface. When Loihi starts shaking, scientists pay attention. ""Think of it as a younger version of Kilauea or Mauna Loa volcanoes,"" said David Phillips, deputy scientist in charge at Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. Phillips said there's no significant hazard at the moment, but at one point HVO recorded 14 earthquakes per hour on the Loihi Seamount. “The peak did take place yesterday afternoon, whether it continues to subside or come back is hard to say,” Phillips said. On a seismogram, more than a hundred temblors struck in the 2- to 3-magnitude range, suggesting magma is on the move. Phillips said if the shaking continues, it could signal an eruption — and that could cause a summit collapse. That’s happened before, last in 1996. A significant eruption could even cause a small tsunami. “There would be very little time to respond,” Phillips said. “It would be certainly less than an hour, could be minutes.” But there is no sign of trouble right now. “From everything we’ve seen, there’s nothing like that coming,” Phillips said. The seamount appears to have settled down. Besides the occasional rumble, the most exciting things on Loihi are the creatures that thrive in the hot water nearly a mile deep.

Floridians launch fundraising effort to help Puerto Rico after earthquake,2020-01-09 22:36 UTC,https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-hillsborough/floridians-launch-fundraising-effort-to-help-puerto-rico-after-earthquake,"Menu TAMPA, Fla. — Floridians are working together to help Puerto Rico in the wake of devastating earthquakes.  Multiple organizations, including Course of Action Foundation and Somos Puerto Rico Tampa, are launching ""Tampa Together for Puerto Rico."" “We were all worried about Puerto Rico we all wanted to do something,” said Jeannie Calderin, the founder of Somos Puerto Rico. Calderin has family on the island, including an uncle on the south side where a 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck this week. It was felt across the region and people have felt shaking since. “My uncle is in the epicenter where everything is happening and what they’re saying is people need air mattresses they need tents things like that,” she said.  The organizations said they’ve stayed in touch with local government officials and learned immediate needs include survival kits, hygiene kits, supplies and meals.  “The one thing that we have identified is the most important thing based on lessons learned is there are still roads usable there’s still movement in the island the economy is still moving supermarkets available hardware available,” said Evelio Otera, with Course of Action Foundation. Organizers said rather than collecting items, they are asking for monetary donations they will use to travel to Puerto Rico and make purchases of items there.  “The most efficient way to handle this is by helping the economy in Puerto Rico by sending teams of organizations down there,” said Otera. They said the goal is working smarter, taking lessons from past relief efforts.  “We spent thousands and thousands of dollars shipping things to Puerto Rico and all the difficulties we went through because of the government over there. Things were more difficult so we have to work smarter not harder and make sure with all money we are getting we are going to get to the people immediately,” said Calderin.  This week, President Trump approved Puerto Rico’s emergency declaration. Tomorrow, Florida lawmakers are planning a trip to meet with leaders there.  “Even though they’re going through this these are people and they need their dignity and they need help,” said Calderin. The groups are accepting checks as well as donations through a GoFundMe page. Checks can also be dropped off to the restaurant Rice-n-Beans.  Report a typo"

"Powerful 7.8 earthquake hits Alaska isles, tsunami possible",2020-07-22 07:40 UTC,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/07/22/nation/powerful-78-earthquake-hits-alaska-isles-tsunami-possible/,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A powerful earthquake located off Alaska’s southern coast jolted some coastal communities late Tuesday, and some residents briefly scrambled for higher ground over fears of a tsunami. There were no immediate reports of damage in the sparsely populated area of the state, and tsunami warning was canceled after the magnitude 7.8 quake off the Alaska Peninsula produced a wave of a less than a foot.  Advertisement Because of its location, nearby communities along the Alaska Peninsula did not experience shaking that would normally be associated with that magnitude of a quake, said Michael West, Alaska State Seismologist.  “No reports of any damage,” Kodiak Police Sgt. Mike Sorter told The Associated Press early Wednesday morning. “No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal.” Kodiak is about 200 miles northeast of where the earthquake was centered. The tsunami warning had coastal residents evacuating for higher ground. Social media posts showed long lines of people fleeing towns like Homer and Kodiak while tsunami sirens wailed in the background. On Kodiak Island, the local high school opened its doors for evacuees, as did the local Catholic school, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “We’ve got a high school full of people,” said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. “I’ve been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,” he told the Daily News. “Everything’s as calm as can be. We’ve got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,” he said before the warning was canceled. Advertisement Tsunami warnings are commonplace for people who grew up in Kodiak. “I’ve been doing these since I was a little kid,” LeDoux told the newspaper. “Old news.” Officials at the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, began calling off tsunami advisories and warnings after a wave of only 25 centimeters (.8 foot) was recorded in the community of Sand Point. “I might have expected a little bit more water, but I’m happy that there wasn’t,” said David Hale, the senior duty scientist at the tsunami center. Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that caused damage in the Anchorage area in November 2018. “This earthquake released about 15 times as much energy as that earthquake, said West, the state seismologist. More than a dozen aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or higher were reported immediately after the earthquake, he said by telephone from the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “We got people here who are going be working all night,” West said early Wednesday morning. “These aftershocks will go and go and go and go.” The Alaska-Aleutian Trench was also where a magnitude 9.2 quake in 1964 was centered. That remains the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded. The temblor and ensuing tsunami caused widespread damage and killed 131 people, some as far away as Oregon and California. Alaska is the most actively seismic state. Nearly 25,000 earthquakes have been recorded in Alaska since Jan. 1, according to the center.

Relief drive underway in N.

(WCSC) - The city of North Charleston is teaming up with a Charleston woman who grew up in Puerto Rico to help those affected by the earthquakes there. Sharon Doublin, who now lives in Charleston, says her mother was visiting her at Christmas when the earthquakes happened and kept her from returning to Puerto Rico. Since late December, Puerto Rico has experienced multiple earthquakes, the most severe being a 6.4-magnitude on Jan. 7.  Doublin decided she needed to help. She has been in contact with other family still in Puerto Rico, who told her about an organization taking supplies in the south end of the island. It helps people who have been displaced from their homes or whose homes are damaged.  When Mayor Keith Summey heard that Doublin was collecting supplies at her work, Job Impulse, he immediately decided to help out. The city hosted a drive at Cane Bay YMCA Saturday to collect goods for those who have been displaced from their houses in the south end of Puerto Rico. They collected donations big and small from canned goods and child care supplies to tents, sleeping bags, and blankets. “I am super proud of being part of a city that has a heart for the people,"" Doublin says. ""And that genuinely they don’t care where you come from, or what’s your background, or what’s your nationality, they’re here to help.” The City of North Charleston has offered to pay to ship all of the supplies to Puerto Rico. But it is not too late to help. Job Impulse will continue collecting supplies this week from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. through Friday. The business is located off of Park Forest Parkway in North Charleston. The city plans to ship the supplies to 10 different cities on Jan. 31. Copyright 2020 WCSC. All rights reserved."

Broward Shelter Takes In Pets Rescued From Earthquake-Riddled Puerto Rico,2020-01-19 20:47 UTC,https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/all-about-animals/broward-shelter-takes-in-pets-rescued-from-earthquake-riddled-puerto-rico/2178802/,"Of more than a hundred animals who were rescued from destroyed shelters in Puerto Rico, a Broward shelter has taken in over twenty, and they will be up for adoption soon. Mary Steffen of the Humane Society of Broward said the organization had taken in 9 cats and 18 dogs in their Dania beach shelter on Sunday. The rest of the 120 animals are being flown to shelters in Massachusetts and New Jersey.  Steffen said the animals had to be removed from their shelters in Puerto Rico because, following a series of earthquakes that have taken a severe toll on the island's infrastructure, the buildings were deemed ""uninhabitable.""  The shelters, Villa Michelle Albergues de Animales and Santuario de San Francisco de Asis, suffer from overcrowding as well as damage. They are among the only amimal rescue centers still open in the hard-hit southern portion of the island, according to Steffen. ""The structure has been damaged in foundation, so walls are cracked, the foundations are cracked,"" Steffen said of one of the shelters. ""It was deemed just unsafe, especially with the amount of aftershocks they're having."" Puerto Rico was rocked by a magnitude 6.4 earthquake on January 7, and then again by another 6.0 quake several days later. The rumbles have caused hardship for residents, knocking out power and leaving many without water.   The animal rescue was a joint effort by Wings of Rescue, which flew the animals out, and Greater Good, which provided funding. In order to give the animals a day to rest, they will be available for adoption at the Humane Society of Broward starting on Martin Luther King Day, according to Steffen."
Puerto Rico earthquake aftermath deepens as govt seeks help,2020-01-10 09:49 UTC,https://www.wtnh.com/news/national/puerto-rico-earthquake-aftermath-deepens-as-govt-seeks-help/,"WTNH.com Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       GUAYANILLA, Puerto Rico (AP) — More than 2,000 people in shelters. Nearly one million without power. Hundreds of thousands without water. The aftermath of a 6.4-magnitude earthquake that killed one person, injured nine others and severely damaged infrastructure in Puerto Rico’s southwest coast is deepening as the island’s government says it is overwhelmed. Many in the affected area are comparing the situation to Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that hit in September 2017, as hundreds of families who are unable to return to their damaged homes wonder where they’ll stay in upcoming weeks and months as hope fades of electricity being restored soon. “We have to remain outside because everything inside is destroyed,” said 84-year-old Brunilda Sánchez, who has been sleeping outdoors in a government-supplied cot in the southwest coastal town of Guánica. “We don’t know how long we’ll have to stay here.” U.S. President Donald Trump declared an emergency in Puerto Rico several hours after Tuesday’s quake hit, a move that frees up federal funds via the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency for things ranging from transportation to medical care to mobile generators. But some local officials worry the help won’t arrive soon enough. “FEMA is a very bureaucratic agency and it moves very slowly. So slowly that we’re still waiting for federal funds from Maria,” Daniel Hernández, director of generation for Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, told The Associated Press. He said FEMA has already pledged to bring mobile generators to bolster the company’s biggest plant, which is located near the island’s southern coast where the quake hit and is severely damaged. Hernández said it’s unclear how quickly the plant can be repaired, noting that a damage assessment is ongoing, although some officials estimated it could take up to one year to repair. Complicating efforts to restore power are strong aftershocks, with more than 40 earthquakes with a 3.0-magnitude or higher occurring since Tuesday’s quake, according to experts. Every time it shakes, personnel have to evacuate and further damage to the plant’s infrastructure is feared, Hernández said. Power company director Jose Ortiz said he expects nearly all customers to have electricity by early next week, adding that extremely preliminary assessments show that at least $50 million in damage occurred. On Thursday, transportation officials closed a portion of one of Puerto Rico’s busiest highways because of what they called serious structural failures related to the quake. Both directions of Highway 52 that runs from the capital of San Juan to the southern coastal city of Ponce were indefinitely closed near Ponce. Meanwhile, those aftershocks have led to a rise in the number of people seeking shelter in southwest Puerto Rico as government officials continue to inspect homes and public housing complexes. Fernando Gil, secretary of Puerto Rico’s Housing Department, urged people to stay with family or in shelters if they felt unsafe in their homes as the government relocated more than two dozen people from damaged residences. “Meanwhile, we will continue to identify what kind of help is needed to support all affected families,” he said. The future of hundreds of schoolchildren in the island’s southwest region also is uncertain as officials delayed the start of classes that was scheduled for Thursday. A three-story school in Guánica that houses nearly 450 children alone saw its first two floors flattened by the quake. There were no children in the school at the time. Education officials said 24 schools were affected by the quake but that teams of engineers were inspecting all of the island’s schools. They said it’s too early to say when classes might start. While officials say it’s too early to provide an estimate of total damage, they say hundreds of homes and businesses were affected by Tuesday’s quake and the 5.8-magnitude one that preceded it on Monday. Teresa Arroyo, a 47-year-old resident of the southern town of Peñuelas, said her home is heavily damaged but she plans to stay there. “Where else am I supposed to go?” she said. “Everyone is depressed.

Coronavirus in Japan sees flooding and earthquake victims seek shelter in cars,2020-07-09 10:59 UTC,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-in-japan-sees-flooding-and-earthquake-victims-seek-shelter-in-cars/,"Watch CBS News

         Tokyo — Even in one of the most earthquake-prone countries on the planet, Japan's catalog of misery seems almost biblical in scale right now. As inhabitants in eastern Japan were shaken awake by an early-morning temblor, hundreds of thousands to the country's south and west were hit with record-breaking torrential rainfall.  Japan's jagged and picturesque topography renders it especially vulnerable to flooding disasters.  Experts say global warming has exacerbated the intensity of precipitation during the annual summer rainy season. Historic rainfall had triggered at least 179 mudslides in 23 prefectures as of Thursday, severing roads and causing at least 59 rivers to burst their banks — coursing currents of muddy water through rural towns.  Bucolic villages were forced to await help for days after floods and landslides cut off utilities and access to the outside world. At least 60 were killed in Kyushu, southwestern Japan, with more than a dozen others missing.  Heavy rain is forecast through at least Sunday across the country, with low-lying areas in particular on alert. At least 80,000 members of the Self-Defense Forces, police, fire and other rescue workers have been deployed to help extract victims. The coronavirus pandemic has complicated rescue, recovery and evacuation efforts. Conspicuously missing as Japan confronts this disaster are the usually-reliable brigades of outside disaster aid volunteers, who bring experience and knowhow in removing mud from damaged homes, lead evacuees in exercise sessions and cook hot meals. This time around, both volunteers and local authorities are worried about the infection risk. While in previous years evacuees were urged to bed down in shelters for their own well-being, this year the common wisdom has been turned on its head. One nonprofit group told Asahi TV that ""shelters should be reserved for those with no other alternatives. We are helping one another by staying in our cars."" ""Shachu-haku"" (sleeping in one's car) is trending online in Japan as evacuees flock to shelters, but then stay in the parking lots. Auto supply shops are doing a brisk business in shachu-haku accessories, including stretchy clothes racks that can be fitted over back seats, and inflatable mini-ottomans. Automaker Mazda now sells shachu-haku overnight bags with inflatable mattress, pillow, mosquito netting to stretch across open windows, and compression socks — to prevent the risk of deep-vein thrombosis for those living in cramped quarters.    Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

Updates: 4.2 earthquake/aftershock felt in the Salt Lake Valley,2020-04-15 03:04 UTC,https://kutv.com/news/local/updates-42-earthquakeaftershock-felt-in-the-salt-lake-valley,
Irish Election Produces an Earthquake as Sinn Fein Tops Poll,2020-02-11 07:36 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/irish-election-produces-an-earthquake-as-sinn-fein-tops-poll_3233546.html,"DUBLIN—Ireland braced for weeks of political uncertainty on Feb. 10 after an earth-shaking election that saw the Irish Republican Army-linked party Sinn Fein—long shunned by its bigger rivals—take the largest share of votes. In a surge that upended Ireland’s traditional two-party system, the left-wing nationalist party beat both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, the centrist parties that have governed Ireland since it won independence from Britain a century ago. The vote in Feb. 8 election essentially split three ways, complicating the negotiations on forming a government that lie ahead. Sinn Fein received 24.5 percent of the first-preference votes, besting the two long-dominant parties. Fianna Fail received 22.2 percent of the votes. Fine Gael, the party of incumbent Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, got 20.9 percent. “I think it’s a mess, to be honest with you,” said Pat O’Toole, a public sector worker in Dublin. “I think we’re going to be in a situation again where we are not going to be able to form a stable government in this country. I really don’t know what’s going to happen.” Sinn Fein’s left-wing proposals for tackling Ireland’s housing crisis and creaking health care system proved a powerful draw for young voters in a country that is still dealing with aftershocks of the 2008 global financial crisis, which hammered its debt-driven “Celtic Tiger” economy. Vote counting resumed Feb. 10 to fill all the seats in the 160-seat Dail, the lower house of Ireland’s Parliament. Ireland uses a proportional representation system in which voters rank candidates from first to last, with the lower preferences of elected or defeated candidates redistributed among their rivals. Sinn Fein’s low number of candidates meant, however, that it could fall just short of the largest number of seats when two days of counting nears conclusion later on Feb. 10—likely behind Fianna Fail but potentially above Fine Gael. No party is likely to reach the 80 seats needed for a majority, making some form of coalition inevitable. But forming a stable alliance looks tough. Both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael said before the election that they would not go into a coalition with Sinn Fein because of its links to past violence. Varadkar said Fine Gael’s stance was unchanged. “I say what I mean and I mean what I say,” he said on Feb. 10. But as the scale of Sinn Fein’s surge became clear, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said, “I’m a democrat.” “I listen to the people. I respect the decision of the people,” he told Irish broadcaster RTE. Talks among the parties are likely to take weeks, though some hope a new government can be formed by St. Patrick’s Day on March 17, when the Irish prime minister traditionally visits the White House. Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald suggested her party could try to form a government with the support of independents and smaller parties such as the Social Democrats and Labour. “We want to talk to anyone who is interested in delivering a program for government, that is about getting to grips with the housing crisis and solving it, getting to grips with the crisis in health and giving families and workers a break and giving a new lease of life to government,” she said. The IRA was responsible for murders, bombings, and other violence for decades during decades of violence known as the “Troubles” in Northern Ireland. More than 3,500 people were killed in conflict between forces that sought to reunify Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland and those who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. Supporters of Sinn Fein point out that it has been more than 20 years since Northern Ireland’s 1998 peace agreement and 15 years since the IRA announced the end of its violent campaign. Sinn Fein already sits in government in Northern Ireland as part of a power-sharing arrangement created by the peace process. Eoin O’Malley, associate professor of political science at Dublin City University, said the party’s past meant little to younger voters without memories of living through the Troubles. He said Sinn Fein had offered the clearest message on social problems in Ireland, which include a growing homelessness crisis, house prices that have risen faster than incomes, and a public health system that hasn’t kept up with demand. “It’s a direct analog to the left-wing populism that you see in Greece and in Spain,” O’Malley said. “In many ways, Sinn Fein are offering relatively simple solutions to pretty complex problems. Mary Lou McDonald said she was going to form ‘a people’s government’ as if all the other governments that have been formed in Ireland had no connection with the ordinary people. It is classic populism.” Fine Gael’s third-place showing likely spells the end of the premiership of Varadkar, who has been Taoiseach, or prime minister, since 2017. Varadkar led Ireland during Britain’s lengthy divorce negotiations with the European Union. The outcome of those talks was crucial to Ireland, the only EU country to share a land border with the UK. Many Irish voters think Varadkar and his party handled Brexit well, securing guarantees that people and goods will continue to flow freely between Ireland and the north. But Brexit featured little in an election campaign dominated by domestic problems. Still, Sinn Fein’s triumph could have implications for Ireland and the UK. The party’s struggle for a united Ireland was on the back burner during the election, but the party is calling for a referendum on reunification within five years. That is not something an Irish government can deliver without the support of Britain and Northern Ireland—highly unlikely in the short term. But Brexit looks likely to nudge Northern Ireland’s economy closer to that of its southern neighbor and could increase pressure for a vote on unification. In London, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, said the UK was “following the results of the Irish election carefully.” He insisted that “the close relationship between the UK and Ireland will continue regardless of the election result.” Share this with everyone!"

         TRENTON, N.J. (CBS) - Dozens of New Jersey State troopers will be heading Puerto Rico this weekend to help with recovery efforts after a series of devastating earthquakes struck the island. Gov. Phil Murphy has authorized the deployment of 50 state police troopers. The troopers are scheduled to arrive on Saturday and will return on Feb. 9. During their time in Puerto Rico, they will provide force protection at seven base camps that are currently housing between 2,000 and 5,000 residents. They will also help out at major traffic control posts. ""Puerto Rico continues to be impacted by the destruction caused by Hurricane Maria, and now the island is also facing the aftermath of devastating earthquakes, leaving many families displaced and without a sense of normalcy,"" said Murphy. ""We will always stand with the people of Puerto Rico, and today, I have directed the New Jersey State Police to assist in emergency response efforts in order to help the people of Puerto Rico rebuild their homes and lives."" Before their arrival, a seven-member advance team will fly from Newark International Airport to San Juan International Airport on Wednesday. The team will pick up supplies at the FEMA Headquarters in Caguas before traveling to Ponce to meet with the troopers. ""Our New Jersey State Troopers are always the first to step up and the last to step aside,"" New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in a statement. ""Just as they did in the wake of Hurricane Maria, they are deploying to help the people of Puerto Rico in their time of need. This skilled group will ensure that aid and relief supplies reach the most impacted people and areas of Puerto Rico.""   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

Carlos Correa raising money after another earthquake in Puerto Rico,2020-01-11 16:23 UTC,https://abc13.com/carlos-correa-raising-money-after-earthquakes-in-puerto-rico/5838393/,"WATCH LIVE ""Another earthquake in PR, 6.0! Please keep us in your prayers,"" the Astros shortstop tweeted. INDIOS, Puerto Rico (KTRK) -- A magnitude 6.0 quake shook Puerto Rico on Saturday, causing further damage along the island's southern coast, where previous recent quakes have toppled homes and schools. Houston Astros shortstop Carlos Correa was one of countless people who experienced the impacts. Correa posted about his experience on his social media accounts early Tuesday. ""Scariest day! Woke up to the bed shaking! Power went out! Everybody in the house yelling!"" Correa said on his Instagram account. While Correa and wife, Daniella Rodriguez, make their home in Houston, he visits his home island often. Correa was raised in Santa Isabel, a fishing village located on the southern side of the island. He asked everyone to keep Puerto Rico in their prayers and let everyone know he was raising money through the Correa Family Foundation for earthquake relief.   Another 4.6 aftershock was detected near the island about an hour later, according to the National Weather Service. Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority said outages were reported across much of southern Puerto Rico and crews were assessing possible damage at power plants. Bárbara Cruz, a prosecutor who was in the southern coastal city of Ponce when the new quake hit, said concrete debris hit the sidewalk as buildings continued to crumble. ""Everyone is out on the street,"" she said.  There were no immediate reports of injuries. It was the strongest shake yet since a magnitude 6.4 quake - the strongest to hit the island in a century - struck before dawn on Tuesday, knocking out power across Puerto Rico and leaving many without water. More than 2,000 people remain in shelters, many fearful of returning to their homes, and others unable to because of extensive damage. Hundreds of quakes have shaken the island since the new year, though most were too slight to be felt. NASA reported Friday that the quakes had moved the land in parts of southern Puerto Rico as much as 5.5 inches, based on satellite images before and after the temblors. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico's Seismic Network, told The Associated Press that he expects still more aftershocks as a result of the latest large one. ""It's going to re-energize an unstable situation,"" he said, adding that seismologists are studying which faults were activated. ""It's a complex zone."" Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans are still without power and water, and thousands are staying in shelters and sleeping on sidewalks since Tuesday's earthquake. That temblor killed one person, injured nine others and damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and several schools and businesses in the island's southwest region.

HOUSTON, Texas  (KTRK) -- Houston Astros shortstop Carlos Correa isn't slowing down his efforts to help the people of Puerto Rico recover after devastating earthquakes. Shelters are becoming harder to come by as homes across the island were damaged or destroyed. Through his Correa Family Foundation, tents were collected on Sunday to send over as temporary shelter. Houstonians were also asked to donate sleeping bags, coolers and solar chargers. ""Our families are still there, so we're looking at every single news and media post, and we started seeing a lot of the families out there and sleeping outside of the houses and they just literally are outside with no roof over their heads,"" said donation organizer Lorna Ortiz. Correa was one of the countless people who experienced the quakes earlier this month and posted about his experience on social media. ""Scariest day! Woke up to the bed shaking! Power went out! Everybody in the house yelling!"" Correa said at the time. The Correa Family Foundation's earthquake recovery fund has exceeded its goal, raising more than $22,000 so far.

Dann Cuellar has more on Action News at 11 p.m. on January 8, 2020. PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- More than 250,000 people in Puerto Rico are still without water and half a million have no power in the wake of the multiple earthquakes that have terrorized the southwestern part of the island. The magnitude 6.4 quake that struck before dawn on Tuesday killed one person, injured nine others and knocked out power across the U.S. territory, and more than half a million Puerto Ricans remained without electricity early Wednesday. Tuesday's quake was the strongest in a century. There are a number of people in the Delaware Valley who have been actively monitoring developments in Puerto Rico. Some are in fact now planning to go there to offer assistance to rattled residents-- many of whom are sleeping out on the streets for fear their homes could collapse. Amanda Ramirez, from our partners at Univision, was in the town of Ponce on Wednesday. ""There's more than 200 families that live in this community but most of those people are now staying with family members in other places on the island or have gone to the shelter that the government has put in place,"" Ramirez reported.   Activist Nancy Santiago, who now lives in Puerto Rico but has roots in Philadelphia, says after going through a major hurricane and now earthquakes, many on the island are understandably shell shocked. ""Folks are living in a moment of crisis and trauma that feels never-ending. That level of toxic stress on the body not only makes people physically ill, it makes it hard to get your life back,"" she said. ""Puerto Ricans are very resilient and they have learned to normalize what is power outages, living without water, but they really just seem like they can't get a break,"" added Councilwoman Maria Quinones-Sanchez. She says her home on the island was not damaged and her relatives are safe, but she, like Santiago, plan to fly to Puerto Rico Saturday to help with relief efforts. ""And I'm getting calls, 'What do we do next, what do we do next.' And that's why once I get on the ground, I want to talk to our partners and figure out how we contribute to support,"" she said. For those wanting to contribute, she believes Salvation Army Puerto Rico is key for providing food, water and other emergency services. Santiago says there are other non-profits that people can contribute. ""Hispanics in Philanthropy,  which is the organization I represent, has a whole host of non-profit organizations that we vet and work with on a regular basis,"" said Santiago. A delegation of emergency responders from the Salvation Army here will also be leaving for Puerto Rico Thursday to offer their assistance as needed.

      The beefy ex-cop sleeps in a twin-size trundle bed a few inches off the hardwood floor. His wife, their 17-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son rest on the attached full-size bed, and their 16-year-old son turns in on the upper bunk.
   
      Another couple and their 10-year-old son share a queen-size bed in the next room.
   
      Three other families sleep on hulking inflatable mattresses that, when propped up during the day, block out the sunlight in the dining and living rooms. 
   
      This is life these days for more than a dozen of Jodie Roure’s relatives who fled a swarm of earthquakes that have hit Puerto Rico since late December. They cram her two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan’s Hamilton Heights neighborhood, forcing Roure to split them up to manage their stress.  
   
      “The tension buildup was so bad that I had some stay with another family member,” said Roure, 49, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “You have 14 to 16 people in less than 1,000 square feet.”
   
      Since the ground started shaking on December 28 – leaving at least one person dead, causing dozens of buildings to crumble, and cutting power and water to swaths of the island – terrified families have been fleeing Puerto Rico.  
   
      Stunned residents, fearing the worst, have abandoned homes for cars and vans, for mattresses dragged onto sidewalks and sprawling tent-covered encampments.       
   
      For Roure’s relatives, the daily lines outside her lone bathroom aren’t so bad in comparison.
   
      “The other day I told my husband to get me a bucket because I couldn’t wait,” Mirta Santiago Cortés, 67, said with a laugh.
   
      There also are discussions about polarized island politics. Meal preparation and cleanup duties. And agreeing on what to eat each night. 
   
      “We’ve had our arguments,” said Santiago’s daughter, Sharon Quiñones Cortés, 46, who came with her to New York with her own husband and their young son, Sebastian.
   
      It’s not the life they’d chose. But, at least for now, it beats the seismic terror. And they’re not alone. 
   
      It’s too early to quantify the scope of this latest diaspora.
   
      Even before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, an unprecedented migration had begun from the Caribbean island to the mainland United States. It was fueled in part by the US commonwealth’s prolonged financial crisis. Then, tens of thousands more departed after the deadly storm, moving to every US state, from Florida to Alaska. 
    
      Santiago, waiting for a pot of coffee to brew in the small kitchen in Hamilton Heights, came to the mainland this month with 16 relatives, all with one-way tickets on the same flight. She said her sister and husband – whose home in Puerto Rico was destroyed – also left in January to stay with family in Chicago. 
   
      Another relative, Miguel Rodriguez, said eight more family members from the island – including his mother, his daughter and grandchildren – moved from Puerto Rico to his Orlando home two weeks ago. 
   
      “We’re struggling,” he said by phone.
   
      The Rev. Jose Rodriguez, an Episcopal priest in Orlando whose church helped people who fled after Maria, said hundreds of families affected by the earthquakes have arrived in Central Florida. 
   
      “We’re all grasping at straws as to what to do with the earthquake families,” he said. “Obviously, it isn’t as large of a movement as after Hurricane Maria. … But these are hundreds of households who are homeless, who are suffering from PTSD, who have been hit by two traumas – Hurricane Maria and now the earthquakes.”
   
      That trauma is palpable in Roure’s overcrowded Manhattan apartment. 
   
      While Sebastian, 10, said he now feels safe, he worries constantly about the fate of friends who stayed behind. 
   
      “I feel bad for them,” he said. “They can’t travel here. Their families are trying to find where to live.”
   
      Quiñones, his mother, said the boy has insisted on sleeping in the same bed as his parents since the first quake in December. 
   
      She and her husband, Ismael, 51, are both accountants and left their home in Guayanilla, on the southern Puerto Rican coast. Before boarding the flight with Santiago, they’d lived less than a mile from Inmaculada Concepción church, which partially collapsed. Sebastian was preparing for his First Communion in May. 
   
      “He doesn’t know the church collapsed,” Quiñones said. “We thought it would be too much to tell him.”
   
      The town’s Costa Sur Power Plant, which produced more than a quarter of Puerto Rico’s electricity, was severely damaged. Most residents have moved outdoors, especially after a magnitude 6.4 earthquake on January 7, the strongest to hit the island of about 3 million US citizens in more than a century.
   
      “Sebastian would start crying at night. Every night,” his mother recalled. “The biggest quakes came at night. I would hear him praying for his friends. … He would ask God to spare us from the earthquakes each night.”
   
      They only decided to leave Puerto Rico because of Sebastian, said Quiñones and her husband. 
   
      “If we return, we will not go back to Guayanilla,” she said. “He doesn’t want to return to the house.”
   
      The couple said they will live off their savings for now. They have taken leave from their jobs with the local government and will handle tax return preparation for private clients remotely. 
   
      “Our final decision will be based on how our son adapts to school here,” said Ismael Quiñones, whose father, four sisters and 19-year-old daughter from a previous marriage remain in Puerto Rico.   
   
      “We invested so much over the years in our home,” his wife said. “It’s hard to walk away.” 
   
      Alejandro Quiles, 40, a retired police officer from the southern coastal town of Guánica, left the island on that same January 14 flight with his wife – another of Santiago’s daughters – Jeannette, 41, plus their daughter and two sons – Ronalys, 17; Alejandro, 16; and Alexander, 7.
   
      “It’s like the walls were screaming,” Quiles said of the recurring earthquakes.
   
      “You’re constantly thinking about the next one,” his son, Alejandro, said. “Will it be bigger? It’s not something you forget.”
   
      The impact of the uncommon and unpredictable quakes are, for some, worse than the hurricane’s aftermath. 
   
      “You can’t compare this to Maria,” Quiles said. “After the storm ended, you felt safe and knew there would be a recovery. In this case, we don’t know when we’ll have more earthquakes.”
   
      Quiles finally decided to lock up and park the truck from which he sold food at the entrance to the beaches of Guánica in front of his home, which sustained some damage. A house two doors down crumbled to the ground.
   
      “You go to sleep each night thinking about what’s going to happen,” Quiles said. “Where will we go? Should we stay here? It’s stressful not being able to control your life.”
   
      His daughter, Ronalys, is a high school senior. She was applying to colleges – but those plans are now on hold. 
   
      “So many people are not as fortunate as we were,” Quiles said. “We’re safe now, but in every other sense – economically, in terms of stability – we’re in limbo.”
   
      Days after the first earthquake in late December, his mother-in-law, Santiago, simply couldn’t spend another moment in Guánica, the town that took the brunt of the damage from the earthquakes. 
   
      “It was like the walls were coming down,” she said of the persistent aftershocks. 
   
      “I was worried about her state of mind,” said her 37-year-old son, Hernan Cortés Quiles. “I told my sisters, ‘We need to get mom off the island.’ If I didn’t do something, I felt I was going to lose her.”
   
      Santiago and about a dozen other family members first moved to Cortés’ apartment in the southwestern town of San Germán, which was also feeling the quakes.  
   
      “They were crying all the time,” Cortés said of his relatives. “No one wanted to be under a roof. They were sitting outside under the hot sun all the time. They seemed very vulnerable.”
   
      Santiago had told her son she would not leave the island without him and her three daughters. So, Cortés, who works for a health plan, said he charged 14 one-way tickets to New York on a credit card at $180 each. Three others covered their own flight costs.
   
      He completed the purchase, though, before telling family in New York they’d be coming. 
   
      So, Cortés called Roure.
   
      “I said, ‘Mami is not well,’” he recalled, referring to Santiago. “She said yes.”
   
      He drove Santiago home to Guánica to pack her bags. After 10 minutes, she broke down in tears. 
   
      “She said, ‘Get me out of this house.’” he said. “I was surprised. She lived in that house all her life.”
   
      Roure and relatives in New York put money together for expenses. She stocked the refrigerator. She used her connections as an activist for post-Maria medical relief efforts on the island to secure donations of winter clothing.  
   
      “We’ll figure it out because we’re resilient,” she said. “But people need to understand there are thousands of families across the United States in the same situation that no one is noticing. They are US citizens. Many fought in our wars and served our country.”
    
      The island has been rocked in recent years by a string of natural disasters, prolonged power outages, economic stagnation, corruption scandals and peaceful anti-government protests that resulted in Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s resignation in July.
   
      “These events have created a deep sense of insecurity among many residents of the island, which has in turn fueled the outmigration to the US mainland,” said Jorge Duany, a professor of anthropology at Florida International University.
   
      “Unless the Island can recover quickly from its embattled situation, it will maintain a high rate of migration, and the population will likely continue to decline in the near future.”
   
      In the weeks and months after Maria – which claimed thousands of lives – nonprofits and local, state and federal agencies on the mainland mobilized to respond to the influx of hurricane survivors. 
   
      “Since you don’t have people dying now, there is not the same sense of urgency,” said Amílcar Antonio Barreto, a professor at Northeastern University. 
   
      “So, those that decide to move to the US mainland, they’re largely going to be left to their own devices and the beneficence of their own family members.”
   
      Duany added, “The growing demand for bilingual teachers, counselors and other staff is one challenge faced by many local schools. Local governments will likewise feel more pressure in their housing and job markets as a result of the increasing exodus.”
   
      As family members filled out applications for Social Security cards to replace ones they left behind, Roure talked on the phone with a Catholic Charities representative about the help they need.
   
      “Housing is the priority right now,” she said. “They need (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits. Health insurance and mental health. They have PTSD. We have four school-aged children. I have two senior citizens who can use senior support centers. They don’t have all their documents.”
   
      “I’m going to speak to a supervisor, and we’ll put our heads together to see what can be provided,” the representative said.
   
      “They want to work,” Roure continued. “These are all people that work. They’re not here to live off the system. The kids need therapy. They’re traumatized. My aunt is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.”
   
      Barreto, who is Puerto Rican, was in San Juan for a conference earlier this month during some of the temblors. He felt a foreboding among residents that was new. 
   
      “It was almost like an internalized trauma,” he said. “It’s more emotional when people, for example, talk about this relative or that relative who moved to the US mainland or elderly relatives who are like, ‘It used to be great to have all the grandkids around, but they’re all now on the mainland.’ The sense of community and cohesion that folks had has eroded a bit.”
   
      On the day Roure’s relatives arrived from Puerto Rico two weeks ago, she took them to an awards ceremony where she was honored for her medical relief efforts after Maria. They were exhausted and hungry.  
   
      “‘I appreciate this award,’” she remembered telling a crowd of community activists and local elected officials.
   
      “‘But we have the same problem right now. We have a new crisis. I want to recognize my family,’” she recalled saying as her 17 relatives stood up. “’They just arrived from Guánica. What can we do for people like them?’”
   
      “The room,” she said, “was in tears.”

Dogs saved from earthquake-ravaged Puerto Rico up for adoption in New Jersey,2020-01-21 18:48 UTC,https://abc7ny.com/pets-animals/dogs-saved-from-quake-ravaged-puerto-rico-up-for-adoption-in-nj/5867869/,"WATCH LIVE Toni Yates reports on the dogs who were evacuated from earthquake-ravaged Puerto Rico. MADISON, New Jersey (WABC) -- As Puerto Rico continues to feel the devastating effects of a series of earthquakes, dogs who were evacuated from the island have arrived in New Jersey to search for fur-ever homes. More than 100 animals from the earthquake-stricken island arrived at Morristown Airport on Sunday and taken to various shelters in the area. The animals were taken from the shelters that were bursting at the seams with homeless animals after the disaster. ""There is probably over half a million stray dogs on the island of Puerto Rico and the shelter system is tremendously overburdened,"" said Eric Larnick with the Sato Project. The Sato Project works with other rescue agencies to bring animals to the States from the island. ""A lot of families have been displaced, they've been without power and lost their homes, and they've been forced to make a really tough decision -- they have to surrender their pets,"" Larnick said. Ten dogs and four cats were taken to St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center where they will soon be available for adoption. ""This is what happens when there are disasters, the interest and the excitement,"" St. Hubert's COO Michelle Thevenin said. ""We see this in all the natural disasters."" Officials thanked The Sato Project and Wings of Rescue for sponsoring the life saving flight. The recent 6.4 magnitude earthquake killed one person and caused more than an estimated $200 million in damage. More than 7,000 people remain in shelters since the quake, and according to The Sato Project, there are as many as 500,000 stray dogs on the island. The Sato Project is planning another flight on Feb. 9. ---------- * More New Jersey news * Send us a news tip * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts  * Follow us on YouTube Simone Biles, Jonathan Owens tie the knot Police search for gunman in Bronx shooting that left teen injured  Man accused of murdering brother, disposing of body"
Chef Jos Andrs activates charity to serve meals in Puerto Rico after earthquake,2020-01-07 19:12 UTC,https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/477170-chef-jose-andres-activates-charity-to-serve-meals-in-puerto,"Chef José Andrés on Tuesday activated his charity to serve meals to the people of Puerto Rico after two massive earthquakes struck the island in as many days. World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit organization founded by the celebrity restauranteur that has developed a reputation for providing free meals to those affected by natural disasters, tweeted that the Chefs for Puerto Rico team began cooking shortly after “being shaken awake this morning.” After being shaken awake this morning, WCK’s #ChefsForPuertoRico team activated and is cooking for those affected by the major earthquakes! Lunch is going out the door now, kitchens are being activated in Yauco & Ponce, and our food trucks are on the way. More updates soon! pic.twitter.com/21Hvgfnwdd — World Central Kitchen (@WCKitchen) January 7, 2020  That is the second powerful earthquake to hit the U.S. territory after roughly 10 days of seismic activity and temblors. A 5.8 magnitude earthquake on Monday toppled the Punta Ventana, a famed natural stone arch along Puerto Rico’s southern coast.  The AP reported that power plants shut down to protect themselves from damage, leaving residents in the dark. World Central Kitchen wrote that they will be distributing solar lamps to families with the help of their partner, Hispanic Federation.  — World Central Kitchen (@WCKitchen) January 7, 2020 Florida Sens. Marco Rubio (R) and Rick Scott (R), as well as Resident Commissioner Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon (R), sent a letter to President Trump on Tuesday urging him to accept Puerto Rican Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced’s request for a disaster declaration. Vásquez told the AP that roughly 300,000 households remained without running water on Tuesday afternoon. She added that she had not yet spoken to the president, though the White House said he has been briefed on the situation.  “Administration officials, including FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, have been in touch with the Governor and her team today, and we will continue to monitor the effects and coordinate with Puerto Rico officials,” a Trump spokesman said.   — José Andrés (@chefjoseandres) January 7, 2020 The chef, a Spanish immigrant who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2013, canceled his planned restaurant in Trump’s D.C. hotel after Trump referred to Mexican immigrants as rapists and other criminals during his 2015 campaign announcement. The Trump Organization sued Andrés for breach of contract and he countersued, but the parties eventually settled the dispute. Andrés and his charity served thousands of meals in Puerto Rico after the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017. He was also forcefully critical of Trump’s handling of that disaster.

Florida Senator Rick Scott on situation in Puerto Rico after earthquake,2020-01-10 22:28 UTC,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article239179983.html, 
"Earthquake damage could leave major Puerto Rico power plant out of action for a year, official says",2020-01-09 22:33 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/09/us/puerto-rico-electric-power/index.html,"
      A crucial Puerto Rico power plant damaged in this week’s earthquakes could be out of operation for more than a year, the head of the island’s electricity authority told CBS News. 
   
      Power has been restored to about 50% of customers after a series of earthquakes since December 28, an official with the utility said Thursday. 
   
      With three major power plants expected to return to service between Thursday and Saturday, Puerto Rico Electric Energy Authority CEO Jose Ortiz said the entire US territory – with about 3 million residents – could have power by the weekend. A fourth could begin operating by Sunday, he said. 
   
      “The target is for Saturday to have everybody with power,” Ortiz told CNN. 
    
      Another complicating factor is the fact the plant’s equipment is decades old, Ortiz said. 
   
      “To be honest, those plants have over 60 years, basically,” he said. “Imagine you have a taxi, 60 years old, and you are required to run that 24/7.” 
   
      The plant’s operations manager, Angel Perez, appeared to differ on the timeline in a separate interview with CBS, saying it would be “no less than a month.” He said they would work “24 hours around the clock” to get the plant back up and running.
   
      Officials are expected to hold a news conference to provide an update on their efforts to restore power.
   
      Hundreds of tremors have struck Puerto Rico since December 28, with Tuesday’s 6.4 magnitude quake being the strongest and likely the most damaging. The quake, centered off the southern coast, left one man dead and caused dozens of homes and structures to crumble.

Sparta hit by 2.2 magnitude tremor morning after 5.1 magnitude earthquake felt across North Carolina,2020-08-10 13:32 UTC,https://www.wnct.com/news/north-carolina/sparta-hit-by-2-2-magnitude-tremor-morning-after-5-1-magnitude-earthquake-felt-across-north-carolina/,"WNCT Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. — The morning after Sparta endured a 5.1 magnitude earthquake, the town was hit by an aftershock.   The mayor of Sparta, Wes Brinegar, issued a state of emergency on Sunday after a 5.1. earthquake that was felt across North Carolina rattled the town.   The mayor says there is widespread minor damage to homes with structures and chimneys being knocked off.  He has been visiting homes and businesses throughout the day.  Many local business in Sparta are closed because of damage caused by the earthquake.  The town was under construction at the time the earthquake hit.  A streetscape project has been under construction for a year now. The mayor says if the 100 year-old waterline was still in the ground, it would have been disastrous. Three homes made of rock were damaged, and the three families living in the homes had to be relocated because the homes are no longer safe to live in after the earthquake moved them off the foundation by four to six inches.  As of Sunday, Sparta had felt up to 11 shakes since Saturday with four of them registering over 2.6 magnitude.  There have also been six to seven minor shakes throughout Allegheny County Sunday afternoon. The mayor says the town is “not out of the woods yet.”   Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. Sunday’s 5.1 earthquake is the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. A viewer in Pfafftown told us, “Around 8 a.m. this morning, our bedroom shook. We thought a tree had fallen but then heard it was an earthquake.” Experts with the United States Geological Survey are telling people to “be ready for more earthquakes” since aftershocks will continue near the mainshock. “The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,” the website reads. Throughout next week, there is a 4 percent chance that one or more aftershocks will be larger than magnitude 5.1, according to the USGS forecast. Smaller earthquakes are more likely through next week. The chance of a magnitude 3 or higher earthquake is 56 percent. Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily. USGS experts say this earthquake could be part of a sequence.

Please enter a search term.       PETRINJA, Croatia (AP) — A strong earthquake in Croatia destroyed buildings and killed at least seven people Tuesday southwest of the capital, displacing scores of area residents or making them afraid to sleep indoors as emergency teams searched for those still missing by nightfall.  Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. Another six people were killed in nearly destroyed villages close to the town, according to HRT state television. At least 26 people were hospitalized, six with serious injuries, officials said, adding that many more people remained unaccounted for. In Petrinja, cries could be heard from underneath destroyed houses. One woman was found alive some four hours after the quake. Emergency teams used rescue dogs in the search for survivors, while family members looked on in despair. “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT. “This is like Hiroshima – half of the city no longer exists.” Firefighters worked to remove the debris from a collapsed building that fell on a car. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the vehicle and carried into an ambulance. The town was left without electricity or running water as officials scrambled to set up temporary accommodation for all of the displaced residents in need. Residents fearing another earthquake seemed poised to spend the night outside their homes. Petrinja resident Marica Pavlovic said the quake felt “worse than a war.” “It was horrible, a shock. You don’t know what to do, whether to run out or hide somewhere,” she told The Associated Press. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable,” Plenkovic said. He said the army has 500 places ready in barracks to house people, while others will be accommodated in nearby hotels and other places. “No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” the prime minister said. Officials also toured a damaged hospital in the nearby town of Sisak, which was also badly hit. Plenkovic said the patients will be evacuated in army helicopters and ambulances. Health officials said a baby was delivered in a tent in front of the hospital in the aftermath of the earthquake. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that she spoke with Plenkovic and instructed an envoy to travel to Croatia as soon as possible. As a Mediterranean country, Croatia is prone to earthquakes, but not big ones. The last strong quake struck in the 1990s when the picturesque Adriatic coast village of Ston was destroyed. The Croatian military was deployed in the quake-hit region to help with the rescue operation. Croatian seismologist Kresimir Kuk described the earthquake as “extremely strong,” far stronger than another one that hit Zagreb and nearby areas in the spring. He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky old buildings and move to newer areas of the city because of aftershocks. In the capital, people ran into the streets in fear. The earthquake was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia and Slovenia. It was felt as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported. Authorities in Slovenia said the Krsko nuclear power plant was temporarily shut down following the earthquake. The power plant is jointly owned by Slovenia and Croatia and located near their border. ___ AP writers Dusan Stojanovic and Jovana Gec in Belgrade, Serbia, contributed to this report.

6 months later: How is Utah doing after largest earthquake in years?,2020-09-05 23:00 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/9/5/21420001/6-months-later-utah-assistance-after-magna-earthquake,"Danny Colosimo cuts sausages into pieces at Colosimo’s Standard Market in Magna on Friday, Sept. 4, 2020. Yukai Peng, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — Nearly six months after a magnitude 5.7 earthquake shook the Wasatch Front, some residents and business owners are still working to pick up the pieces of their lives —and their homes.  The earthquake struck on March 18, its epicenter just north of Magna, and was followed by dozens of smaller aftershocks. It was the largest earthquake Utah’s experienced in decades and came in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has only served to exacerbate the difficulty of rebuilding. Even months after the disaster, the damage is still evident while walking through Magna, according to Greg Schulz, a town administrator.  In response to the earthquake, President Donald Trump issued a Major Disaster Declaration on July 9, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has since distributed $480,890 in grant money to help residents repair and rebuild, according to Joe Dougherty, a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Public Safety.  A wall that was broken during an&nbsp;earthquake in March has been repaired at Colosimo’s Standard Market in Magna on Friday, Sept. 4, 2020. Yukai Peng, Deseret News A corner of Colosimo’s in Magna is missing after a 5.7 magnitude earthquake hit the area early Wednesday, March 18, 2020. Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News It is the first time in state history that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has offered Utah residents financial aid under its Individual Assistance Program, he said.  The application period for the federal money ends Tuesday. So far, 542 applications have been approved and more are still being processed, according to Dougherty. Additionally, the U.S. Small Business Administration has approved 43 homes for low-interest loans that total $835,800, as well as one business which received $4,900, he said.  Yet even those figures could be a far cry from the actual monetary damage incurred by Utah’s private sector. Estimating total costs when not everyone applies for aid and when that aid doesn’t cover certain expenses, such as broken dishes or damaged household appliances, is difficult.  “Really, all we’ll really be able to tell you is not how much damage we had but how much money has been approved for homeowners right now,” Dougherty said.  Government officials have a better idea of the financial toll on public infrastructure, which is currently estimated around $100 million, according to Dougherty. But unlike individual Utahns, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is not providing relief for Utah’s public sector. This is partially a function of just how prepared Utah’s government was for an earthquake.  Much of the state’s public infrastructure is well insured against earthquakes — a natural precaution for a state with a fault line running through it, according to Dougherty. But such precautions lower the chances of Utah receiving federal aid.  “FEMA cannot reimburse — like, by law — they can’t reimburse a state for damages if the state had insurance for those damages, right? Because then the state would be getting a double payment,” Dougherty said.  Accordingly, Utah was denied federal aid on July 17. However, the state appealed the decision on Aug. 15, asking for hazard mitigation assistance, which would allow the government to rebuild damaged buildings in a more fortified manner. Government officials also think uninsured buildings may have taken more damage than initially reported.  “We are asking for a deeper dive to figure out if there are damages that weren’t covered by insurance that could be covered by the federal government,” Dougherty said.  If public assistance is granted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will reimburse eligible expenses at a rate of 75%, and state and local governments will be responsible for the rest of the costs.  A Colosimo’s Standard Market sign that fell down during an&nbsp;earthquake&nbsp;in March is pictured in Magna on Friday, Sept. 4, 2020. Yukai Peng, Deseret News Regardless of the federal government’s decision — which should come in the next month or so — Dougherty is grateful for their efforts.  “FEMA has to work under certain guidelines, and we’ve always appreciated the work that they’ve done in our state. Because what FEMA is doing is representing the help of the rest of the American people, because those are taxpayers’ dollars. It’s like, ‘Hey, Utah had the disaster this time? How can the American people help?’ FEMA is the agent for making that help happen.” “The night before the earthquake, my brother Charlie and I were talking about how lucky we were that we had a product during the virus that was still sought out and still wanted and still bought,” said Danny Colosimo, who is part of the family that runs Colosimo’s Original Standard Market & Sausage Factory in Magna. “Then we get up the next morning, and the earthquake hit, and we just looked at each other” in shock.  Schulz said several businesses in Magna have had to close because of the tumultuous events of 2020. If COVID-19 was an unforeseen difficulty, then the earthquake was the “dagger” for many businesses.  “I hate to say the die was cast, where there was no way to recover, so they moved on,” he said.  Still, others have managed to keep going, working through both crises by modifying the way they do business, at least temporarily.

Yukai Peng, Deseret News Danny Colosimo piles sausages onto a cart before putting them into boxes at Colosimo’s Standard Market in Magna on Friday, Sept. 4, 2020. Yukai Peng, Deseret News Colosimo’s sausage factory and store, which has been open for decades, hasn’t let the earthquake keep it down.  “We really never stopped,” Colosimo said. “We had some wholesale work that we had to do, and we kept producing for people who would literally come to the back door and want sausage.”  The store sustained significant damage during the initial quake, and the owners had to receive county approval before letting customers back inside. They paid the cost for repairs out of pocket, which totaled tens of thousands of dollars. As far as Colosimo knows, their application for federal money is still being looked at.  The Magna community was supportive throughout the crisis, however, and Colosimo said several people called and offered money, and another individual even tried to start a GoFundMe page for the store.  “When they called they cared more about our safety than they did when we would be able to produce more,” he said, “which is worth all the money in the world.” Residents of Magna may receive another financial boost in the coming weeks as the community pursues a listing to the National Register of Historical Places, an effort which was spurred by the earthquake, according to Schulz.  “Magna just has such a great history; they have such a great stock of historic buildings, that it was kind of shock that none of that had really been listed on the national register before, with the exception of The Empress Theatre on Main Street,” said Christopher Merritt, a state historic preservation officer with the Utah Division of State History. With the structural damage the town sustained, Merritt hopes the community can rebuild in such a way that maintains a sense of history.  There are currently around 1,400 buildings and 50 historic districts in the state. Being on the register comes with financial perks that could aid a community trying to rebuild, according to Merritt. “Once it’s listed, every property that is identified as significant is eligible now for a tax credit, so that is a blanket versus each business owner trying to list their own personal business,” he said.  The Magna Town Council will review the proposal in the coming weeks, then a Utah Division of State History board will review it, and finally it will be passed to the U.S. National Park Service for approval. “We had a lot of damage in the earthquake, but there was a lot of opportunity. And Magna in particular has really seized upon that as a way to put their arms around their cool history, their cool building stock,” Merritt said. “Which is so cool that we’re taking this sad event with lots of property damage but being able to turn it into something very positive for that community.” As it turns out, two negatives may actually equal a positive. And an earthquake during COVID-19 could have a silver lining. While the pandemic has slowed construction efforts somewhat, according to Schulz, it may have protected people during the earthquake itself.

Allred, Deseret News  One certainty about life on the Wasatch Fault is tectonic activity.  Utah experiences hundreds of earthquakes a year, according to Dougherty. Though tremors as large as the earthquake in March are rare, even greater ones could be building beneath the surface.  “Utah has the potential for something upwards of 7.0, that’s what the Wasatch Fault is capable of producing,” he said. “The shaking from that would be so much more intense, there would be so much more damage. And that’s why that individual responsibility, that individual preparedness, is so critical to our state.” He hopes the earthquake in March acts as a wake-up call for residents of the Beehive State. And since Utah doesn’t have any state assistance programs for such disasters, personal responsibility is paramount.  “We can start building those really good habits of preparedness so that we are ready to act appropriately when the next earthquake happens,” Dougherty said. “And notice I said not if, when the next earthquake happens.” He recommends doing a few simple things to start preparing for an earthquake.  First is keeping a flashlight and a pair of shoes by your bed. He said people often cut their feet during an earthquake by stepping on shattered glass. Keeping water and food storages in your house as well as an emergency kit stocked with needed medications is also a good idea.  Additionally, he asked people to text loved ones before calling during an emergency situation, as doing so takes up less bandwidth. Perhaps most importantly, he emphasized the importance of getting earthquake insurance. Similar to how the state has been able to rebuild without burdening Utahns and without the federal government’s money, personal insurance policies give individuals self-reliance.  “I will always have earthquake insurance, and I will tell all of my friends to have earthquake insurance,” he said. “And some of them have started buying policies because I am willing to go tell them about the peace of mind and the safety that my family feels if an earthquake destroys my home.” Copyright © 2023 Deseret News Publishing Company.

Sparta hit by 2.2 magnitude tremor morning after 5.1 magnitude earthquake felt across North Carolina,2020-08-10 13:53 UTC,https://www.fox46.com/news/sparta-hit-by-2-2-magnitude-tremor-morning-after-5-1-magnitude-earthquake-felt-across-north-carolina/,"Queen City News Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. — The morning after Sparta endured a 5.1 magnitude earthquake, the town was hit by an aftershock.   The mayor of Sparta, Wes Brinegar, issued a state of emergency on Sunday after a 5.1. earthquake that was felt across North Carolina rattled the town.   The mayor says there is widespread minor damage to homes with structures and chimneys being knocked off.  He has been visiting homes and businesses throughout the day.  Many local business in Sparta are closed because of damage caused by the earthquake.  The town was under construction at the time the earthquake hit.  A streetscape project has been under construction for a year now. The mayor says if the 100 year-old waterline was still in the ground, it would have been disastrous. Three homes made of rock were damaged, and the three families living in the homes had to be relocated because the homes are no longer safe to live in after the earthquake moved them off the foundation by four to six inches.  As of Sunday, Sparta had felt up to 11 shakes since Saturday with four of them registering over 2.6 magnitude.  Get breaking news alerts with the Queen City News mobile app. It’s FREE! Download for iOS or Android There have also been six to seven minor shakes throughout Allegheny County Sunday afternoon. The mayor says the town is “not out of the woods yet.”   Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. Sunday’s 5.1 earthquake is the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. A viewer in Pfafftown told us, “Around 8 a.m. this morning, our bedroom shook. We thought a tree had fallen but then heard it was an earthquake.” Experts with the United States Geological Survey are telling people to “be ready for more earthquakes” since aftershocks will continue near the mainshock. “The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,” the website reads. Throughout next week, there is a 4 percent chance that one or more aftershocks will be larger than magnitude 5.1, according to the USGS forecast. Smaller earthquakes are more likely through next week. The chance of a magnitude 3 or higher earthquake is 56 percent. Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily. USGS experts say this earthquake could be part of a sequence.

"Weird, Z-shaped faults could trigger a large earthquake on California's San Andreas Fault",2020-07-17 15:11 UTC,https://www.livescience.com/weird-faults-trigger-san-andreas-earthquake.html,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Two big earthquakes at Ridgecrest last year have increased the chances of a San Andreas Fault quake. It's impossible to know when the San Andreas Fault will erupt with its next big earthquake — a temblor that could impact the nearly 13 million people who live in the Los Angeles metro area — but it appears that two other nearby faults might have some say in that matter. The San Andreas Fault is part of a giant ""Z"" of faults; the top of the ""Z"" consists of the Ridgecrest Fault, the middle is the Garlock Fault and the bottom is the southern part of the famous San Andreas. If the ""top-of-the-Z"" Ridgecrest Fault were to have a really big earthquake (at least a magnitude 7.5), that could trigger an earthquake on the ""middle-of-the-Z"" Garlock Fault, which, in turn, could cause a massive earthquake along the ""bottom-of-the-Z"" San Andreas, a new study finds.  These successive earthquakes wouldn't necessarily happen all at once, but over a period of time (perhaps even decades) as stress builds up and gets transferred from one fault to the next, said study co-author Ross Stein, a geophysicist and the founder and CEO of Temblor, Inc., a company that models and assesses earthquake risks.  ""What we are describing isn't likely and it's a kind of an earthquake chain reaction,"" Stein told Live Science. ""But what we've learned over the last four months is chain reactions really do happen in nature. And if we are unprepared, as we were in COVID, they have enormous consequences."" There are so many faults (and earthquakes) in California because that's where the Pacific Plate grinds against the North American tectonic plate. However, the San Andreas Fault, which snakes roughly 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) from the Salton Sea to the Mendocino Coast, is notorious because it caused the deadliest earthquake in the nation's history; the 1906 magnitude-7.8 San Francisco earthquake killed an estimated 3,000 people.  The new analysis of this possible ""earthquake chain reaction"" suggests that another large San Andreas rumbler near Los Angeles is now 3.5 to 5 times more likely than scientists previously thought, thanks to the Ridgecrest quakes.  The Garlock Fault is relatively quiet; it hasn't released a significant earthquake in about 500 years. But if the Garlock Fault ruptures within about 30 miles (45 km) of its junction with the San Andreas Fault, it could raise the likelihood of a San Andreas quake to the southeast — the so-called Mojave section — by a factor of about 150, Stein and study co-author Shinji Toda, a professor of natural disaster research who specializes in seismology at Tohoku University in Japan, wrote on the Temblor blog.  ""We thus estimate the net chance of a large San Andreas earthquake in the next 12 months to be 1.15%, or 1 chance in 87,"" they wrote in the post.  Such an earthquake could be catastrophic. Were a magnitude-7.8 earthquake to hit the southern San Andreas Fault, it could cause more than 1,800 deaths, 50,000 injuries and $200 billion in damage and other losses, according to a 2008 report from the U.S. Geological Survey.    ""Ridgecrest was a humbling experience,"" Stein told Live Science. ""I think anybody would have told you that given how well mapped California is, that any fault that can [release] a 7.1 would have been known. And it was unknown."" The 2019 earthquakes along Ridgecrest added stress along the Garlock Fault, according to information gleaned from satellite data, Stein said.    However, the area's big earthquakes don't happen like clockwork, so it's challenging to know when the next powerful one might hit, Stein noted. So, to forecast when the next massive earthquake might strike, Stein and Toda developed a new forecasting method. (To be clear, a forecast is not the same as a prediction, because it's impossible to predict earthquakes. Instead, forecasts look at probability, or the chance that an earthquake of a certain magnitude might happen in a given place and time period.) This machine-learning model looked at how stress was transferred by earthquakes and used past earthquakes to test its accuracy. In fact, the model shows that the June 2020 Ridgecrest earthquakes fit into the forecast for the region. The model showed — in part because of the added stress from the recent Ridgecrest earthquakes — that the Garlock Fault has a 2.3% chance of producing a magnitude-7.7 earthquake in the next year, or a 1 in 43 probability. This chance is 100 times higher than the 0.023% chance given by the Third California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF3), a forecast that is put out by the Southern California Earthquake Center and the California Geological Survey and released in 2017. And, this possible magnitude-7.7 (or even a magnitude-7.5) earthquake along the Garlock Fault, the model shows, could trigger a large earthquake along the Mojave section of the San Andreas Fault, Stein said.    Even so, it's good that the public and public-policy experts be aware of this chance, however small, Stein said. It could also serve as a gentle reminder that people living near the San Andreas Fault should retrofit their houses to make them earthquake-ready, assemble earthquake-preparedness kits and buy earthquake insurance, Stein said.  ""If you're a homeowner and you've been on the fence about earthquake insurance [because] it's too expensive,"" keep in mind that your risk just went up by a factor of 3.5 to 5, Stein said. It doesn't appear that insurance companies are raising rates because of this study, ""so you're basically getting insurance at a colossal discount,"" he said.   —New photos of Pakistan's earthquake island released  Other geophysicists have pointed out that the new study's model doesn't account for the Earth's intricacies. For instance, the model doesn't incorporate the complexities of fluid interactions, which can change stresses on faults over time, nor does it factor in the different types of rock in that region, Pablo Gonzalez, a geophysicist with the University of Liverpool in England, who was not part of the study, told National Geographic (opens in new tab). Stein said that since the study came out in the journal Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America on July 14, he's talked with a number of colleagues who have pointed out issues with the model. Many of these issues are addressed in the study's supplementary data, he said, but even so, models can never completely mimic real-world situations. ""I feel that what we are saying is speculative and it's uncertain, and we acknowledge that and we understand that,"" Stein said. ""But the flip side of that coin is [that] the consequences of this are so important that we should try to estimate it, and this should start a discussion of what we should be putting in our models of earthquake occurrence.""

"Inside the newsroom: The earthquake hit, and that's when the action really started on a week unlike any other",2020-03-22 02:48 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/3/21/21187228/magna-earthquake-salt-lake-coronavirus-covid-19,"Israel Garcia is forced to exit his mobile home from a window after it was damaged in a 5.7 magnitude earthquake centered in Magna on Wednesday, March 18, 2020. Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News SALT LAKE CITY — Saturday morning in Salt Lake City the streets weren’t just quiet. They were empty, save a few souls carefully keeping their distance from one another. On Main Street there were no cars. Four homeless men guarded the corners of the block. Whether intended or otherwise, they were a good 50 feet apart. I ventured outside to walk to the corner pharmacy to pick up a prescription, one of the approved outings in this time of isolation. Also acceptable are quick shopping trips for groceries and a walk for fresh air, as long as we all honor the no-closer-than-six-feet rule. Social distancing is king, and if you don’t abide by its rule you’ll likely be greeted with a justifiable glare. Saturday was the end of a remarkable week for the nation, made more remarkable for Utahns startled by a 5.7 magnitude earthquake on Wednesday morning. It was a violent shaking in the town of Magna — with a direct line through downtown Salt Lake City — that brought down bricks, broke windows and further unnerved an already nervous populace. Much of our news staff had already been working remotely last week. They were immediately dispatched from their homes to trouble spots and to work the phones. Initial information was posted to our website from Herb Scribner, working a quick-hit trending desk posting immediate information on the magnitude of the quake and where it was located.   Pat Reavy working on breaking news also immediately engaged for those first crucial minutes. Both were under the direction of Content Director Aaron Shill and News Director Brian West.

Steve Griffin, Deseret News Unified Fire Chief Dan Petersen talks during a press conference at the Salt Lake County Emergency Coordination Center in South Salt Lake on Wednesday, March 18, 2020, following a 5.7 magnitude earthquake&nbsp;that was centered in Magna. Steve Griffin, Deseret News That was the start of the day and the reporting began as soon as the shaking stopped with news reporters contributing paragraph by paragraph. Other nonbreaking news teams joined in, checking hospitals, schools and the infrastructure of the state. Lois Collins from our in-depth team began working on a piece about wide-felt anxiety from such a troubling week. And throughout the day our news teams and the combined effort of the Deseret News and KSL newsroom reported record traffic to our websites, deseret.com and KSL.com.  KSL NewsRadio became an immediate source of information, despite the initial loss of power to our newsroom. We ran on auxiliary power until restoration about 5 p.m. that day. KSL-TV reporters went live for hours, initially broadcasting from a parking lot as they too overcame power issues.  “The number of minutes spent by readers at news sites increased 46 percent from the same period ending a few days ago last year, and overall visits rose 57 percent, according to a study of more than a dozen general news websites by comScore, a media measurement company.” The difficulty with such a news week is that we know this is only the beginning. Social distancing and the necessity of work-from-home will tax the entire country. The next stories  will be about job losses and the rise in COVID-19 cases locally.  This is straining alternative weekly newspapers like Salt Lake City Weekly and Monterey County Weekly, and has brought dozens of layoffs already across the country to journalists working at weeklies in Seattle, California and elsewhere that are out of business due to the loss of advertising from restaurant, club and entertainment venues shuttered by the coronavirus. And it’s not just the press that is facing such dramatic changes in how jobs are accomplished. Thursday morning, economist Natalie Gochnour, head of the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute and a columnist for the Deseret News, was readying for an appearance on The Hinckley Report with Jason Perry. That’s unusual for a show normally taped Friday mornings. But this week the show’s three guests who would usually sit together on a panel were taped one at a time in separate segments for the half-hour show. “We wanted to make sure we were following the guidance of the CDC and emulating the behavior everyone is doing,” Perry told me last week. “We’re just trying to model the social distancing habits.” That’s happening on morning TV shows like NBC’s “Today” show and ABC’s “Good Morning America,” and it’s happening with the White House press corps, which is screened for good health before entering the briefing room and sitting at distance. In the Deseret News newsroom and throughout the office we’re observing best practices.  Our meetings are done via Zoom or Google Hangouts. We’re glad to be able to do our jobs this way, but it heightens the need for exact communication. We also are more aware of how we are gathering news. Do you send someone to the middle of the airport to interview travelers coming into town? Can we accomplish it from 6 feet away, or be effective reporting by phone? These are questions we’re asking each day as things change in Utah and the country. Just how do we effectively communicate with each other? One last thing. Gov. Gary Herbert called for communication of another sort when he invited Utahns to embark on a weekend of prayer and service, noting that even if one isn’t a churchgoer it will bring a measure of peace.  Following the quake and the rise of COVID-19 cases, more than one person inside the newsroom joked, “What’s next, locusts?” Sadly, locusts are ravaging Africa, with the United Nations describing the swarms in the Horn of Africa as a crisis. Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia are most at risk. Swarms are also in Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and India, and it is threatening the food supply of millions of people. If you’re kneeling down to pray this weekend for Utah, don’t forget to include everyone else.

"Power restored, crews survey damage, geological effects of Utah earthquake",2020-03-19 17:58 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/3/19/21186816/magna-utah-5-7-magnitude-earthquake-salt-lake-airport-flights-power,"Adam Hiscock, Utah Geological Survey hazards geologist, looks at a crack as he assesses earthquake effects at the Great Salt Lake Marina on Thursday, March 19, 2020. Kristin Murphy, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — On Thursday morning the Wasatch Front returned to some normalcy even as cleanup continues amid the rumbling of aftershocks of the previous day’s magnitude 5.7 earthquake.  Flights have resumed at Salt Lake City International Airport, but some airlines are still dealing with the aftermath from as many as 70 flights being diverted Wednesday. “We are trying to get back to normal as soon as possible. I always recommend that customers contact the airlines if their flight is delayed or if there are any cancellations that may impact their travel,” said airport spokeswoman Nancy Volmer.  She added the some of the airlines are still working to get people to their original destination. Structurally, both the airport and the construction site passed inspection, Volmer said.  As for the airport’s air traffic control tower, the Federal Aviation Administration said a thorough structural assessment is still needed. “Air traffic controllers are working with limited capability from an airport ramp tower. The FAA is transporting a mobile tower to SLC in case the primary tower cannot be used for an extended period. The mobile tower was scheduled to arrive Wednesday evening,” an FAA spokesman said in a statement. “The Salt Lake City Terminal Radar Approach Control, which guides aircraft into and out of SLC and other nearby airports, is temporarily operating on a limited basis out of the Salt Lake Air Route Traffic Control Center, which handles higher-altitude traffic,” the spokesman said. John Gleason, spokesman for the Utah Department of Transportation, said as of midday Thursday 13 teams of inspectors had checked out the structural integrity of 291 bridges, out of the 621 bridges identified as existing in the earthquake zone.  “One of our main priorities is checking out all of our bridges to make sure they are in good working order,” he said.  Of the bridges inspected so far, only one was “red-flagged” and taken out of service — the Fort Union flyover ramp to I-215. “We need to get in there and see what exactly needs to be addressed and if it is just surface damage or if something more that we need to get in there and fix,” he said. The team of inspectors are working as quickly as they can to get the rest of the bridges inspected and may be done by Friday night, but Gleason stressed the crews have to be thorough to ensure motorists’ safety. “Never has it been so important that we do have such a strong transportation system,” he said. “The good news and news that people can take away in a day of uncertainty is they can take a lot of comfort in the fact that our roads and bridges are meant to withstand earthquakes like this.” The 3rd and 2nd District courts, which shut down due to the earthquake, were reopened Thursday after all the buildings passed inspection, according to Geoffrey Fattah, spokesman for the Utah State Courts. Canyons School District, too, reported all of its facilities passed inspection and are safe to occupy. Dominion Energy’s supply pipelines also held up, according to spokesman Don Porter. “Obviously nobody wanted this to happen, but for decades we have been building and upgrading the pipelines in our system with the goal that if anything like this ever happened, you would like to know it would survive,” he said.  “This was a pretty good shake,” he said, commending the work of engineers and other professionals involved over the years to ensure pipeline safety.  Dominion Energy typically gets 68 emergency calls a day, but after Wednesday’s earthquake, 1,768 came in, Porter said. “All of our crews went out and by the middle of the afternoon they had taken care of all but 100 of those calls,” he said.

Kristin Murphy, Deseret News The most severely impacted area in terms of natural gas issues was the mobile home park on 7200 West in West Valley City, where the lines to the meters to individual residences were damaged, Porter said. Ten crews are out working there Thursday and could possibly finish with the repairs by day’s end, he added. “They will check them one by one,” Porter said.  The city condemned 49 of the mobile homes that were deemed uninhabitable, he added, and the goal is to get natural gas into the rest of the residences as quickly as possible, especially in light of the cool temperatures. Porter added that Dominion Energy, in light of the coronavirus pandemic, is suspending shutoffs for nonpayment and working to get those that were shut off back on the system.  “It is not that people won’t have to pay their bills. They will have to pay for the gas that they use. We are trying to be a good neighbor. We know people are out of work. We want them to be able to cook and stay warm,” he said. Local American Red Cross teams have been deployed to neighborhoods to assess the damage to homes and offer assistance where necessary. The Red Cross evacuation and information center at Taylorsville High School will remain open until 8 p.m.  If people are unable to come to the center they should call 1-800-REDCROSS. USGS &amp; Michelle Budge Earlier Thursday, the state downgraded from a level one emergency activation to level two, which is a partial activation, according to Joe Dougherty, spokesman for the Utah Division of Emergency Management. Dougherty said there is not a need to have as many state employees for earthquake updates. Because everyone is in the assessment stage, there is not yet a dollar value on the damage the earthquake caused or how many homes and businesses were impacted. Dougherty said the agency continues to be active by coordinating with other government entities and responding to concerns from residents.  “People are continuing to ask questions, and good questions, on social media on what these earthquakes mean,” he said. Readying for preparedness is a good remedy for the anxiety some people might be feeling, he noted.  Dougherty urged residents to go to beready.utah.gov for information on how to be prepared in a natural disaster.  Utah’s liquor stores — which all closed due to the earthquake on Wednesday — reopened with modified hours due to the coronavirus. Terry Wood, spokesman for the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, said there was some breakage from the earthquake, but it was minimal. “Not all stores had bottles come off the shelf,” he said. The agency’s warehouse had some bottles break and a sprinkler rupture which caused some flooding, Wood added. Fears over the coronavirus stoked by the earthquake likely led to the long line at Utah’s busiest liquor store — the one in Cottonwood Heights. Wood said he was there before noon to survey the situation and was amazed at the number of people coming out so early. As inspections continue and rubble clearing goes on, employees of the Utah Geological Survey are carrying out an additional form of surveillance of earthquake impacts. Two teams of geologists mobilized Wednesday to look for evidence of surface fault rupture, liquefaction, lateral spread and other geological effects. “This is an ongoing sequence so earthquake effects from aftershocks may not have been reviewed yet,” said Nathan Schwebach, a spokesman with the parent agency, the Utah Department of Natural Resources. Field teams went to an area north of the Salt Lake airport, along the Jordan River east of the airport, the Baileys Lake area, along I-80 between the airport and Saltair, and to downtown Magna. Schwebach said geologists observed minor lateral spread in some small areas near the Jordan River. The “spread” is where soils can become jelly-like. Lateral spread can occur in areas with shallow groundwater and soils conducive to liquefaction.  He added that monitoring is ongoing, but the spread is of minimal concern.  Teams will continue to monitor aftershocks and will conduct additional field work along the east bench of Salt Lake County looking for rockfall.  The geologists used drones to get aerial views of damage out by Saltair and the Great Salt Lake State Park Marina, which closed its entrance due to a pipeline that ruptured in that area.  The team of geologists will be in the field for some time doing on-the-ground inspections and documenting evidence of lateral spread.  Emily Kleber, a geologist with the survey, said there was some cracking and expanded cracks, but not as much as one might expect. “There’s damage but it is not like the movies,” she said.

A new way to identify a rare type of earthquake in time to issue lifesaving tsunami warnings,2020-01-06 12:06 UTC,https://news.yahoo.com/way-identify-rare-type-earthquake-120632432.html,"Just a few times in a century, somewhere on the globe, a rare “tsunami earthquake” occurs. These are mysterious because, while they’re just medium-sized as earthquakes go, they cause disproportionately large and devastating tsunamis. This type of midsized earthquake is very different than an event like the 2004 earthquake in Sumatra – a very big magnitude 9.2 event which unsurprisingly produced a huge tsunami. The most recent tsunami earthquake happened in 2010. A magnitude 7.8 earthquake off the Mentawai Islands in Indonesia set off a tsunami that was over 50 feet in height in some places – much greater than seismologists would predict based just on the earthquake’s size. 509 people were killed, and 15,000 more were displaced or left homeless. Tsunami earthquakes are particularly destructive and dangerous because the massive tsunami waves can hit local coastal communities within just five to 15 minutes – before officials can issue a warning. But based on our analysis of previously unavailable closeup observations of the 2010 Mentawai event, my colleagues and I think there is a way to determine that an event is a tsunami earthquake in time to warn people that an unexpectedly large wave is on the way. The Earth’s surface is made up of floating tectonic plates that fit together like a slightly imperfect jigsaw puzzle. These plates are moving next to, under or away from each other. In a subduction zone, one tectonic plate is sinking beneath another. This builds up stresses over time and will eventually create an earthquake. Most typical subduction-zone earthquakes occur roughly 10 to 30 miles down, in an area where the rocks are rigid and strong on the fault between the two tectonic plates. Meanwhile, the shallowest area of a subduction zone, closest to the seafloor, is made up of soft sediments that are not very strong. Earthquakes rarely occur only here, because stresses mostly don’t build up in these soft, weak rocks. Geoscientists define an earthquake’s overall size with its magnitude. Earthquake magnitude describes how much “work” is accomplished by the earthquake moving the fault – more work for either more movement, or for moving more rigid rock. Very large earthquakes, like the magnitude 9 Tohoku earthquake in Japan in 2011, are so big that they break the deeper part of the subduction zone, but also continue upwards to break the shallow part of a subduction zone. This rapid earthquake motion moves the seafloor and creates a tsunami. “Tsunami earthquakes” are strange in that they happen almost entirely in the soft, weak section of the fault. Because tsunami earthquakes break such soft rock, they happen slower, and create much more movement on or near the seafloor in comparison to a normal subduction-zone earthquake of the same size that happens in rigid rock. This in turn creates a much larger tsunami than expected. A tsunami earthquake might have the same magnitude as an earthquake that occurs in rigid rock but produces much less of what seismologists call high-frequency energy. Think of breaking a thick slab of concrete – which is strong and would produce an audible bang with both low and high-pitched noise – versus breaking a loaf of bread, which makes almost no sound at all. In the Earth, “sound” is the shaking you feel under your feet. The soft bread break is like a tsunami earthquake that doesn’t release a lot of high-frequency energy, and thus doesn’t create as much shaking as we would expect for its magnitude. Currently, officials rely on knowing an earthquake’s magnitude and location to issue tsunami warnings within tens of minutes. But this doesn’t work in the case of tsunami earthquakes, because the earthquake’s magnitude doesn’t match up with the size of the tsunami it produces. Instead, to figure out whether an earthquake is in fact a tsunami earthquake, scientists compare its seismic magnitude measured from afar with the amount of high frequency radiated energy it produced, as recorded by far away stations.  The problem is that in the past, scientists had never recorded one of these elusive earthquakes closeup in what we call the near-field – within about 180 miles (300 kilometers) or so. Instead, scientists have had to find an earthquake’s energy-to-magnitude ratio using seismic waves that have traveled all the way from the epicenter of the earthquake across the world to where researchers can measure them. This process is relatively slow, so we haven’t been able to identify tsunami earthquakes quickly enough to warn people in time, before the wave hits the coast. Now my colleagues and I have for the first time analyzed data recorded by seismic stations that happened to be near the epicenter of the 2010 Mentawai earthquake. We think we have figured out a new way to identify the danger of a future tsunami earthquake, faster. Our new study used the same concept of comparing the energy released by an earthquake to its seismic magnitude – but based on data from geographically close to the event. Instead of looking at energy measurements recorded at a distance, we used two proxies. To look directly at how much the ground shook, we used seismic stations onshore near the epicenters of 16 earthquakes, including the Mentawai one in 2010. Because the amount the ground accelerates when seismic waves pass through illustrates how much high frequency energy is in the earthquake, this information was a stand-in for the data we would traditionally get from the far-flung teleseismic stations. Low accelerations mean little high frequency energy. For the normal earthquakes we looked at, the accelerations from near-field seismometers were close to what we’d expect for each earthquake’s magnitude. In comparison, the 2010 Mentawai earthquake’s accelerations were closer to what we would expect for a magnitude 6.3 earthquake – whereas the earthquake was actually a magnitude 7.8, and produced a tsunami we’d expect for an event of greater than magnitude 8. We also looked at GPS stations close to the earthquakes. They can show us how much the ground actually moved or was displaced, and measure the earthquake magnitude itself. Using these measurements together allowed us to compare the amount of energy in the earthquake with respect to its magnitude – without waiting for the seismic waves to travel across the globe. Instead, we would have been able to identify a tsunami earthquake immediately by looking at how low the accelerations were on local seismometers in comparison to the magnitude of the earthquake based on GPS readings. We think our finding is really promising because these near-field measurements are available immediately – even while an earthquake is happening. Seismologists could use this approach in the future, to identify a tsunami earthquake right after it happens, and provide warning to the nearby coast before the tsunami wave arrives.

Residents on the Island of Hawaiʻi are accustomed to feeling earthquakes. As the ground shaking subsides and the safety of everyone around is assured, one of the first questions we typically ask is “how big was that earthquake?”
Before seismologists had the equipment to calculate magnitudes, people relied on physical damage and human observations. Such observations could be compiled and analyzed to determine where the shaking seemed most intense and identify the epicenter.
By 1930, Hawai‘i had earthquake report cards that were distributed to the community by HVO staff for people to write detailed information about what they observed during earthquakes.
These report cards became crucial for understanding seismicity while methods for measuring earthquakes were limited or non-existent. The reports helped estimate the sizes of historic earthquakes by comparing how earthquakes were observed in the past to how they are observed today.
Earthquake observations recorded in journals and report cards not only became a portal for scientists to look back in time at the historical seismicity but also provided vital data points that helped determine the intensities of the earthquakes felt in different regions.
ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADIn the early 1900s, Italian volcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli developed a scale to categorize the intensity of shaking from an earthquake based on the effects reported by the impacted community.
This scale has since been adopted in the United States as the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) Scale. The MMI scale is one of the most meaningful earthquake measurements in describing the areal extent and severity of the shaking at the surface.
Different seismogenic regions can produce varying levels of intensity from the same magnitude of earthquake, depending on distance from hypocenter, direction of rupture, underlying geology, and even building design. A single large earthquake might have reports that span the entire I-XII range of the MMI scale.
This is why the MMI scale is the best way to communicate the relative effects among earthquakes. Values are derived from direct observations of the public and will give the best sense of shaking experienced in different regions.
Today, we no longer provide earthquake report cards but instead, you can go online and fill out a “Did You Feel It” (DYFI) report, or even check intensities calculated in your region for older events, based on reported observations.
ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADWhile intensity is a great way to assess the effects in areas around the earthquake, seismologists needed an objective and quick method to determine an earthquake’s size that does not rely on having a populated area around the earthquakes.
In the 1930s, seismologist Charles Richter came up with the first known method to describe earthquake size based on the maximum amplitude measured from specific seismographs (instruments that measure earthquakes) deployed in southern California.
Richter defined a magnitude-3 earthquake as producing a 1 mm (3/64 inch) peak swing on a torsion seismograph located 100 km (62 miles) away from the earthquake epicenter. He used this arbitrary designation to simply define size of a specific event and with the assumption that other earthquakes could be much smaller or much larger, he invoked the logarithmic scaling. Also central to Richter’s work was determining how seismic wave amplitudes varied depending on the distance between the earthquake and recording seismic station.
Richter used a base-10 logarithmic scale, which means that each whole-number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase. But a tenfold increase in what? Does that mean the energy released was ten times bigger?
The tenfold increase on the Richter scale is simply in regard to that max amplitude measurement on the seismogram, or earthquake-record. Energy release is actually portrayed by Richter magnitude logarithmically to approximately base-32, meaning that each whole magnitude increase releases about 32 times the energy.
ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADOther magnitude scales have developed over time with the same principles of taking a physical measurement from the seismogram to produce an objective value, with the intent of emulating the relationship among earthquakes that Richter established.
The next time you feel an earthquake, take the proper safety precautions. Then—instead of asking how big that earthquake was—fill out your DYFI forms and ask yourself what the intensity was based on your observed effects, and see if the associated magnitude is what you expected!
Volcano Activity Updates
Kīlauea Volcano is not erupting. Its USGS Volcano Alert level remains at NORMAL. Kīlauea updates are issued monthly.
Kīlauea monitoring data for the month of September show variable but typical rates of seismicity and ground deformation, low rates of sulfur dioxide emissions, and only minor geologic changes since the end of eruptive activity in September 2018. The water lake at the bottom of Halema‘uma‘u continues to slowly expand and deepen. For the most current information on the lake, go online.
Mauna Loa is not erupting and remains at Volcano Alert Level ADVISORY. This alert level does not mean that an eruption is imminent or that progression to an eruption from the current level of unrest is certain. Mauna Loa updates are issued weekly.
This past week, about 115 small-magnitude earthquakes were recorded beneath the upper-elevations of Mauna Loa; most of these occurred at shallow depths of less than 8 kilometers (about 5 miles). Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements show long-term slowly increasing summit inflation, consistent with magma supply to the volcano’s shallow storage system. Gas concentrations and fumarole temperatures as measured at both Sulphur Cone and the summit remain stable. Webcams show no changes to the landscape. For more information on current monitoring of Mauna Loa Volcano, go online.
There was one event with three or more felt reports in the Hawaiian Islands during the past week: an M2.3 earthquake five miles NE of Honomu at a 22-mile depth on Sept. 27 at 7:35 p.m. HST.
HVO continues to closely monitor both Kīlauea and Mauna Loa for any signs of increased activity. Email questions to [email protected].

3.1 magnitude earthquake shakes part of New Jersey early Wednesday morning,2020-09-09 10:53 UTC,https://www.pennlive.com/nation-world/2020/09/31-magnitude-earthquake-shakes-part-of-new-jersey-early-wednesday-morning.html,"A U.S. Geological Survey map showing the location of a small earthquake near Freehold Township.USGS A brief rumbling woke people up in New Jersey early Wednesday, just after they had returned to work and school following Labor Day weekend. The U.S. Geological Survey reported a preliminary 3.1 magnitude earthquake near Freehold Township. The temblor reportedly happened a little more than a mile southeast of East Freehold just after 2 a.m. Wednesday, the USGS said on its Earthquake Hazards Program website minutes after the event. The National Weather Service’s Mount Holly office tweeted that the small earthquake was felt “in much of central New Jersey.” New Jerseyans in Freehold and beyond posted about the late-night earthquake on social media, checking to see if everyone else felt the same shaking. The rattling woke up some locals who had gone to sleep, while others were startled by the event as they were getting ready to turn in for the night. Some people received earthquake alerts on their phones. New Yorkers said they felt the Jersey event on Staten Island and in Queens. “It sounded like a dump truck being dropped from a few stories up, but about 4-5 blocks away,” a Matawan resident reported on an earthquake-tracking website run by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre in Paris. “It rumbled the floor for about 5 seconds. I could feel from my feet on the floor and through the seat of the chair.” The U.S. Geological Survey reviewed a report of a 3.1 magnitude earthquake just after 2 a.m. Wednesday.USGS The EMSC, which uses an app called LastQuake to gather witness reports, received accounts from people within a 30-mile radius of the earthquake’s origin. “Whole house shook for several seconds at 2 a.m.,” an East Brunswick resident reported. “Initially thought it may have been a low flying aircraft or helicopter, but none in the area.” “Everyone woke up including the dog,” a Roosevelt resident said. “I thought a car hit the garage.” Just about nine years ago, on the afternoon of Aug. 23, 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake in central Virginia shook buildings in New Jersey. It was one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded in the eastern U.S.  No major damage was reported in New Jersey at that time, but some buildings were evacuated and many residents felt the shaking in their cars and offices. The 2011 quake was the biggest felt in the state in recent memory, but there have been other minor events. A 2.8 magnitude earthquake hit near Bernardsville in 2015. In 2014, a 1.7 magnitude earthquake rattled New Jersey southeast of Trenton. And in 2012, just days after Hurricane Sandy, a 2.0 magnitude earthquake happened near Ringwood. UHH ANY OTHER FREEHOLD FOLKS JUST FEEL THAT EARTHQUAKE I think I just felt an earthquake in Freehold, NJ.  Did anyone else feel it? #earthquake That’s right. Absolutely insane. We just had an earthquake in my town. East Freehold. Never heard or felt anything like this. Insane pic.twitter.com/1V6BO1zonQ Woke up an hour ago to my furniture moving and shaking and found out there was an #earthquake in NJ and that some peeps in LI felt it. I knew I wasn’t that crazy. Just felt an earthquake in Nj few min ago. @ 2020 I got class in the morning can you stop???? #earthquake 2020 ... what is you doinnnn 🥴 #earthquake pic.twitter.com/nIRBu6pUFu why are the tectonic plates having a party at 2 am in new jersey...cmon now #earthquake Did we just get an #earthquake in #NewJersey wtf was that? pic.twitter.com/TxsIRO1rdi Yup, it’s 2 in the morning and I just felt an #earthquake in NJ. I did not have #earthquake in NJ at 2am on my apocalypse bingo for 2020!  People on the east coast on their way to the fridge to get a late night snack be like...  #earthquake pic.twitter.com/3hJZ5iNjdr I didn’t have 2am #earthquake in NJ on my 2020 bingo card that’s for sure pic.twitter.com/3sZFaT0yHo The tectonic plates in New Jersey at 2 am. #earthquake pic.twitter.com/gdHqPDezHp Me in my bed feeling that shake.

"'Did I just feel an earthquake?': Many surprised, others unbothered by NC's 5.1 magnitude earthquake",2020-08-10 03:01 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/09/did-i-just-feel-an-earthquake-many-surprised-others-unbothered-by-ncs-magnitude-earthquake/,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Sunday morning’s earthquake did not cause any damage in Charlotte and nearby areas. But, that doesn’t mean people aren’t talking about it, because so many felt the 5.1 magnitude earthquake. Earthquakes are not all that common in North Carolina. Sunday was the first time many people experienced what it was like to sit through the shaking and rattling of this type of magnitude. This was the biggest earthquake to hit North Carolina since 1916, according to the USGS. The shaking ground did not stop service at St. Mark’s Episcopal in Gastonia. Video from a recorded livestream shows the priest continuing on with his sermon without the slightest of a pause. “My first thought was, ‘Was that an earthquake? Did I just feel an earthquake?’ said Dionne Browning, a member of St. Mark’s Episcopal. Browning was behind the camera filming at the time. She said she was blown away by the priest’s composure through the unexpected Earth movements. Realizing that no one would be hurt, the priest even made a joke once the shaking stopped. “He said not to worry and that it was just God saying, ‘Amen to his sermon,’ said Browning. Around Charlotte, some others were rattled by the historic 5.1 magnitude earthquake. “My house started shaking ... it was pretty scary,” said Cindy Houseworth of Charlotte. Derrick Funberburk, another who felt the ground shake said, “For me, it was just an uncomfortable 8 seconds wondering what exactly is going on and was worried about my kids. That was it.”  Anytime there’s an earthquake, aftershocks follow. When that happens, the movement of the Earth happens in shorter, weaker spurts. According to Dr. Andy Bobyarchick, an Earth Science professor at UNC Charlotte, aftershocks could very well be in our future, but he says there’s nothing to be worried about. “The aftershocks for this earthquake are probably not going to be large enough to cause damage or possibly be felt,” said Dr. Bobyarchick. Not everyone was so shocked about this earthquake. There are some people who did not feel anything at all when it happened. Copyright 2020 WBTV. All rights reserved."
"Alaska earthquake that prompted tsunami evacuations, but no big wave, may offer clue in scientific debate",2020-07-23 03:20 UTC,https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/science/2020/07/22/alaska-earthquake-that-prompted-tsunami-evacuations-but-no-big-wave-may-offer-clue-in-scientific-debate/,"Russell Creek Road in Cold Bay was damaged during the magnitude 7.8 earthquake Tuesday evening. (Candace Nielsen photo)  A powerful earthquake that prompted tsunami warnings and evacuations Tuesday night caused serious shaking in some Alaska Peninsula communities but little damage. Now, the state seismologist says the quake itself might offer some insight into a scientific debate on earthquakes in the region. Shortly after 10 p.m. Tuesday, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake centered about 65 miles south of Perryville on the Alaska Peninsula prompted a series of tsunami warnings that stretched from the Aleutian Islands all the way to the western Kenai Peninsula. Sirens sounded in multiple communities into the night. The warnings sent Alaskans scrambling to higher ground in communities as widespread as Kodiak, Sand Point, Unalaska and Homer. Jennifer Kalmakoff, 44, was on a four-wheeler ride with her daughter just outside Perryville when she watched a rockslide on an island across the water Tuesday night. Then the back wheels of the four-wheeler started swerving. Maybe it was because they were going fast on the sand dunes, she thought, but by the time they got back to the village, she saw people heading to higher ground. When she sat down at home, Kalmakoff saw everything shifting. She stood up and left quickly. “We didn’t have time to grab anything,” she said. “We just ran straight out the door and headed for the hills.” National Tsunami Warning Center officials canceled the tsunami warnings less than two hours after they were issued once there was no longer a threat. Kalmakoff and others in coastal communities across the region began to return home. The earthquake did produce a wave, albeit a roughly 10-inch one recorded in Sand Point.  Though some people in Anchorage received tsunami warning alerts, the Anchorage area was not at risk, said Louise Fode, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service. [Tsunami alerts were mistakenly sent to Anchorage after 7.8 earthquake off Alaska Peninsula, officials say] Watch the waves from the M7.8 Alaska earthquake roll across seismic stations in North America!

This animation, called a Ground Motion Visualization (GMV), shows the motion of the ground as detected on seismometers across North America - each dot is a seismic station and when the ground moves up it turns red and when it moves down it turns blue.

Waves generated by an earthquake travel around and through the earth, but they get smaller (attenuate) as they move away from the earthquake location, just like ripples in a pond. Once the earthquake waves are far enough away from the location where the earthquake occurred they can no longer be felt by people, BUT they can still be detected by sensitive seismic instruments. That's what this animation is showing - the waves from the M7.8 earthquake traveling both through the earth and across earth's surface - in the continental US the earthquake the waves are much too small to feel but not too small to measure. The scale is along the bottom. It is in micrometers (microns). For reference, the diameter of a human hair is ~50-75 microns.

The star shows the location of the earthquake. The green triangle is the station recording the seismogram shown along the bottom. The red line between the 2 is the ""great circle path"".

*Some of the instruments look like they are experiencing shaking before the seismic waves arrive. This is due to the setting of the animation and the calibration of the seismic instrument.

**The video is not reflecting the actual speed of the waves; it has been sped up. The time is shown along the bottom

This particular GMV is a brand new beta product generated using the vertical component of our Ground Motion Visualization (GMV). To produce a better coverage, the video is based on all available stations from any FDSN data center, using the fedcatalog service (http://service.iris.edu/irisws/fedcatalog/1/). The video uses the available BHZ, LHZ, or HHZ channel to produce the video, therefore provides a better coverage.

To see more GMV's visits http://ds.iris.edu/spud/gmv/17971022 The Alaska Earthquake Center recorded “very strong shaking” in places such as Sand Point, Cold Bay and Perryville, where the center has seismic stations, said Michael West, state seismologist at the Alaska Earthquake Center. The quake released “something like 15 times more energy than was released in the (magnitude 7.1) 2018 Anchorage earthquake,” according to West. Anecdotally, he said they’d heard about things falling off the wall but that they weren’t aware of “significant damage.” The earthquake itself is generating scientific interest because some evidence shows it may have occurred in a region — known as the Shumagin Gap, near the Shumagin Islands — where large earthquakes haven’t been documented before. Two tectonic plates meet along the southern coast of Alaska and pressure builds as the Pacific plate goes below the North American plate, known as a subduction zone. Energy builds up and then gets released in the form of earthquakes. Basically everywhere else outside of the Shumagin Gap along that subduction zone has ruptured, West said. “There has been a vigorous debate about whether it is an area that is somehow immune from large earthquakes because the fault pressure is kind of constantly released instead of building up to a big earthquake ... or whether it’s just really overdue,” West said. Michael West is an Alaska state seismologist based based at the Alaska Earthquake Center in Fairbanks. (JR Ancheta / UAF)  The aftershocks of the Tuesday night quake are occurring west of its epicenter, a “fairly strong suggestion that this earthquake in fact ruptured into the Shumagin Gap,” West said. But of course, it’s incredibly early in the research, and there’s a lot of data he would like to see. It will take time to figure everything out, West said, including looking at satellite images, and other measurements that might take a while. Plus, scientists can’t go on a field trip to the site of the quake since it’s underwater and it didn’t rupture up to the surface. If earthquakes can, in fact, rupture in the Shumagin Islands area, West said, “it kind of opens the door on what types of earthquakes could occur in that region. And that in turn impacts what kind of tsunamis we might expect, what kind of tsunamis we should plan for.” West acknowledged the collective sense of relief that the event wasn’t deadly. He said he was scared when he first got the alert because he knows the impact an earthquake in such a location can have. “With us now being able to rest easy about the impact of this earthquake, yeah, there’s some pretty meaningful science behind it as well,” West said. Location of earthquake Tuesday off the Alaska Peninsula. IUSGS map)  James Gridley, director of the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, said early Wednesday that “our procedures put us into a warning even if we haven’t measured a tsunami wave — we imply that there is until we know better.”  People in the community reported the ground felt “like Jell-O” during the earthquake and that it was hard to stand, Kalmakoff said. In Perryville, she said, they’re more used to magnitude 5.0 earthquakes but not what happened Tuesday. “Everybody was shaken up,” she said. “It took us a good 45 minutes to calm down.” Kalmakoff, a former health aide, said she helped tend to a man who was injured after he slipped on broken glass as he was running out. Aside from that, she’s heard about pictures falling and pantry items toppling. Candace Nielsen, 28, who lives in Cold Bay on the tip of the Alaska Peninsula and sits on the city council, felt the shaking in bed Tuesday night. She’s used to earthquakes, but this one kept going. “It was like the whole house was on a extremely rough wave,” she said. Nielsen, her husband and her three kids — who are 5 months old, 2 years old and 7 years old — waited for the shaking to stop. Her 7-year-old daughter was “petrified,” she said. Then they got word of the tsunami warning. Nielsen went through a similar situation two years ago, but this was scarier because of how strong the earthquake was, she said. Nielsen got the kids dressed, grabbed blankets and diapers and left the house to meet her mom. They, along with their two dogs, all piled into Nielsen’s truck and headed to Cold Bay’s evacuation site. Her husband, a first responder, was helping coordinate evacuations in their other truck.  She just wanted to get home and put her kids in bed, Nielsen said. Cell service at the evacuation site is “patchy,” and Nielsen wanted to check in with the rest of her family. She thought that she’d have cracks in the foundation of her house, but they only had a plant fall. And in Cold Bay, there was a patch of road damaged. “I just wanted to get back and tell everybody that we were OK,” Nielsen said. “And just to know that our town was OK and wasn’t under a wave.” [Because of a high volume of comments requiring moderation, we are temporarily disabling comments on many of our articles so editors can focus on the coronavirus crisis and other coverage.

The USGS reports that the epicenter was 45 miles west of Challis and 73.3 miles north of Meridian. According to the USGS map, the epicenter of the earthquake was next to Shake Creek and Laidlow Creek northwest of Stanley in the north-central Idaho mountains. The USGS had a delay in reporting the earthquake because of social distancing, according to Paul Bodin, the head of the University of Washington seismology lab, who talked to our sister station in Seattle, KING. People in six different states reportedly felt the 6.5 magnitude earthquake, according to the USGS's intensity map. According to National Weather Service Boise, this earthquake was the second strongest earthquake in the world for the last 30 days. By Wednesday morning at least 45 aftershocks had been registered by the USGS. The largest one registering at a 4.6 magnitude.  Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     ""We don't hear that much about Idaho earthquakes because they are fairly unusual,"" Bodin said. ""The last one that was this big was back in 1983. It was in Borah Peak."" The earthquake came less than two weeks after a major quake rattled Utah, Idaho's neighbor to the south. That 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck just outside Salt Lake City, damaging buildings and spurring evacuations. The USGS said the earthquake's depth was 10 kilometers -- more than six miles deep -- but still defined as a ""shallow"" earthquake. Shallow quakes tend to be more damaging than quakes centered at greater depths, according to the USGS. Boise Mayor Lauren McLean tweeted out ""Boise, yes you did feel an #earthquake. City officials are checking all our facilities and public safety officers are conducting structural checks downtown and in our neighborhoods."" Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     Dylan Mikesell, an associate geoscience professor at Boise State University said, ""For an earthquake of this size, we can expect to feel some aftershocks for the next week and they should taper off. Probably something similar to what Salt Lake is experiencing in terms of aftershocks."" Several aftershocks rattled Idaho by Wednesday morning, with 4.6, 3.4, and 3.6-magnitude shocks felt throughout Boise and the Treasure Valley. KTVB contacted several gas stations in Challis, Stanley, and Cascade and they said there was no severe damage to buildings or property there. The Boise Police Department tweeted Tuesday that they have not received any reports of damage. But the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist on 8th Street in Boise posted online that the tremors had cracked the stone cross on top of the cathedral. The cathedral asked for prayers that the cross could be salvaged with repairs.  The Custer County Sheriff's Office told KTVB that they have no reported structural damage at this time. Officials with St. Luke's said they've completed floor by floor checks of all of their hospitals and gave given the all-clear. A spokeswoman for Idaho Power said the company has conducted inspections of all its power plants and dams and found no damage to any of them. The earthquake also resulted in no outages. The USGS said the area of the earthquake is related to a tectonic extension linked to a magnitude 6.9 Borah Peak earthquake in 1983.

Ivy Ceballo, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — Jeff Maxfield recalled a saying of a geology expert who was frequently asked when there is going to be an earthquake in Utah.   When people were startled by that answer, he assured them he was just kidding, but added, “You need to be prepared as if that were true.” Maxfield and others in the emergency response sector say the magnitude 5.7 earthquake that rattled the Wasatch Front should be the kindle that sets everyone on fire over being prepared for an even more severe earthquake or other natural disaster.  “I hope people start taking it a little more seriously, including myself,” said Maxfield, a professor in the emergency services department at Utah Valley University who has taken four trips with students to Christchurch, New Zealand, to study the aftermath of two earthquakes there.  Customers line up midday in Salt Lake City waiting for Costco to open, after it temporarily closed due to a 5.7 earthquake that struck Magna shortly after 7am, on Wednesday, March 18, 2020.

Ivy Ceballo, Deseret News Customers line up midday in Salt Lake City waiting for Costco to open, after it temporarily closed due to a 5.7 earthquake that struck Magna shortly after 7am, on Wednesday, March 18, 2020. Stores have been extremely busy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Kristin Murphy, Deseret News One earthquake of 7.1 magnitude happened in September 2010, and while it caused damage, it happened in the middle of night and no lives were lost, Maxfield said. A second one of magnitude 6.3 struck at lunchtime in February of the following year, killing 185 people and destroying thousands of homes. It happened on a much more shallow fault so its impact was greater.  “There are lessons to be learned about preparedness. They (the residents) kind of had the attitude that, well it won’t happen here,” Maxfield said. “They no longer have that attitude. It was a wake-up call.” Joe Dougherty, spokesman for the Utah Division of Emergency Management, said it’s wise for Utahns to use the quake as a teaching moment for preparedness — a message that state officials have tried to hammer home each year with the annual Great Shakeout earthquake drill.  ”Utah is earthquake country,” he said, noting that fault lines crisscross throughout the Salt Lake Valley and along the Wasatch Front. Each year, the state sees hundreds of miniquakes.  Though there is the “possibility” Wednesday’s earthquake could have been a foreshock, experts can’t and aren’t predicting that, Dougherty said.  ”Best-case scenario, this is a reminder that earthquakes are a reality and that people should make preparedness a part of their regular life,” he said.  He urged Utahns to visit utah.gov/beready to see what they can do to protect their families and homes, including strapping down water heaters and performing a “home hazard hunt” of items that should be secured or moved to lower shelves. He also urged Utahns to keep a flashlight and shoes near their bed in case power goes out or if there’s broken glass.  Dougherty said he doesn’t like discussing “worst-case scenario,” but it’s a scenario state leaders have been preparing for and modeling for years. A 7.0 magnitude earthquake would be devastating to the Wasatch Front and the state’s entire economy.  Maxfield, a retired chief operations officer for what was then Salt Lake County Fire Department, said there are geographic similarities on the Wasatch Front to the area where the earthquake happened in New Zealand that caused the fatalities. That area was on an alluvial plain, which is a largely flat area formed by sediments deposited by rivers. In Utah, the majority of the state’s population is crammed into an area that is the bed of the former Lake Bonneville.  When the sediments are shaken, they liquify causing the ground to lose its rigidness and to shake buildings more violently. Maxfield said Christchurch lost its water supply and sewer system and had to remove tons of liquefaction material. “A lot of people may have heard of the earthquakes in New Zealand, but they didn’t realize what the impacts were,” Maxfield said. “I take the students over there to help them see and feel what earthquakes do,” he said, adding that it is intense study that involves talking to survivors, visiting impacted areas and learning about policy shifts that took place in the aftermath. Utah residents, he warned, need to be mindful of a natural disaster that could keep them out of their home indefinitely and be prepared to have access to sufficient water supplies. “You can’t bathe with bottled water.” Maxfield reiterated his hope that Wednesday’s earthquake spurs people to be proactive. “This is something that we have been telling everyone to be prepared for for a long time,” he said.

Scott G Winterton, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — Some Utah school districts are suspending distribution of grab-and-go meals and instructional materials following an earthquake measuring 5.7 magnitude earthquake shortly after 7 a.m. Wednesday. All Utah schools are in the midst of a two-week “soft closure” at the direction of state leaders to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Most are now closed as school employees assess possible earthquake damage to schools. Many schools are providing meal service to students during the closure, but that has been suspended while district officials inspect schools for damage and to ensure the safety of employees. Utahns should check with their local school districts or charter schools for additional information.   This story will be updated as more information becomes available. Granite School District has issued a statement that says “all school and district operations will cease for the day.”     A tweet said all Davis School District facilities are closed and will resume business on Thursday. “We are closing to ensure the safety of staff and the public,” it said. “Lunches will not be available at schools today, Wednesday, March 18, and device distribution will be suspended until tomorrow.”      Copyright © 2023 Deseret News Publishing Company.

Rochesterians worry about loved ones after 6.4-magnitude earthquake strikes Puerto Rico,2020-01-07 15:56 UTC,https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2020/01/07/puerto-rico-earthquake-rochester-ny-residents-worry-about-loved-ones/2831132001/,"Rochester area residents with ties to Puerto Rico — and loved ones on the island — woke to the news of yet-another massive earthquake. A 6.4-magnitude earthquake rumbled across Puerto Rico early Tuesday, killing at least one person and knocking out power to virtually the entire island of more than 3 million. An aftershock three hours later registered 6.0 magnitude. The temblors came one day after the island was shaken by a 5.8 magnitude quake that crumbled homes and triggered states of emergency across the island. More than 300 people have fled their homes and sought refuge. Tuesday's quake was the largest in a series of quakes that have struck the U.S. territory in recent days and caused heavy damage in some areas. Orlando Ortiz of Rochester said his father and grandfather felt the Tuesday temblor and rushed outside their shared home in Cayey, Puerto Rico, which is about 45 minutes south of San Juan. While their property did not sustain any damage from the quake, he said the two men are without power and are seeking out supplies, including batteries. The quakes rocked an island barely recovered from Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017, killing thousands, destroying thousands of homes and knocking out power for weeks. ""I can't imagine being there and reliving this,"" Ortiz said. ""Losing power is reminiscent of what happened after Hurricane Maria. I'd imagine people are better prepared to deal with an outage this time."" Ortiz said his father and grandfather purchased a generator after losing power in 2017, but did not prepare for a natural disaster in other ways. Margarita Gonzalez Martinez of Rochester visits her native Puerto Rico each year and arrived on New Year's Day for a planned 12-week stay. The temblor and its aftershock had her and her husband scrambling Tuesday at their hotel, the Wyndham Grand Río Mar in Río Grande, a municipality in the island's Northern Coastal Valley. Gonzalez Martinez said she was awake and unable to sleep when she ""heard a loud noise and the lights in the hotel went off."" ""The bed was shaking and moving like a hammock,"" she said. ""It was so scary. I started praying and yelling for my husband to get up. We've never experienced anything like this."" Several hours later, everything shook again. The pair remained at the hotel, which has electricity via generators, she said, adding that hotel officials encouraged guests to stay on the property for the time being. ""It's safer here right now,"" she said. ""It will all be OK. We just have to trust God."" Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Gonzalez Martinez left the island as a teenager. She lived for years in Buffalo before moving to Rochester about 25 years ago. She returns to Puerto Rico annually, in part to visit the many friends and relatives who still live there. She has connected with loved ones, who are ""all over the island."" ""Everyone is checking in on each other and are OK,"" she said. Puerto Rican Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced ordered government employees, except for first responders, to stay home. She also urged residents to follow the island's emergency management social media sites for updated information. ""I hope everybody is fine,"" she said on Twitter. ""We urge you to remain calm and safe."" She also said residents should make emergency preparations for more quakes in the next few days. Ponce Mayor Mayita Meléndez said at least one person died and eight were injured Tuesday in the southern coastal city. One man was killed when a wall collapsed at his home.  The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan was operating on generators, but all flights remained on schedule, Aerostar Puerto Rico CEO Jorge Hernández said.  Albert Rodríguez, in the southwest town of Guánica, said the tsunami sirens went off before officials canceled the alert. He said there is widespread damage in his neighborhood. “The road is cracked in the middle and it lifted up,” he said. Monday's quake unleashed small landslides, causing power outages and severely cracking homes. That quake destroyed a popular tourist landmark, Punta Ventana, a coastal rock formation that had formed a sort of rounded window. The Puerto Rico Tourism Co. confirmed that two other sites, Cueva Ventana and Ruinas del Faro, also suffered irreparable damage. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, said it was too early to determine the extent of damage from Tuesday's temblors. “We expect that this will be the largest quake for now,” he said. “The aftershocks will continue for some time.” The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico's southern region began Dec. 28 with a 4.7 magnitude quake followed by a 5.0. The preliminary location Tuesday's earthquake was about 7 miles from Monday's 5.8 earthquake. Over the past several weeks, hundreds of small earthquakes have occurred in this same region.  One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a magnitude 7.3 quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people."

Spenser Heaps, Deseret News  As soon as my house stopped shaking, my phone began to ring. “Whoa! We just had an earthquake! Did you feel that?” staff photographer Laura Seitz exclaimed just after 7 a.m. “Yup! We got rocked here, too,” I said. “Call you right back!”   Because of COVID-19, we had already shifted into working remotely, but due to the severity of the quake, I knew this day was going to be challenging. I started making calls to our Deseret News photographers for an all-hands-on-deck response after a 5.7 magnitude struck Magna and was felt throughout the Wasatch Front on March 18. Everyone knows that when it comes to big stories, we’re all in this together for as long as we need to be. So our night photographer Scott Winterton responded in his Herriman community that morning, knowing he would likely have a long day, while those on day shifts started extra early so we could quickly upload our photos on the web.  Depending on the location of the photographers’ residence is how and where we prioritized the locations that they we responded to first. But information that was accurate was hard to come by. We simply didn’t know which areas had been seriously damaged.  Our news-gathering partners from KSL-TV were knocked off the air that morning for a short amount of time due to the quake, so getting information into the newsroom and then broadcast out to the public, including those of us working remotely, was not fast at first. We broke out the portable police scanners, watched social media, made phone call after phone call, and worked our sources to gather as much information as we could. Within minutes of Spenser Heaps, deputy director of photography for the Deseret News, arriving on scene of a damaged downtown building, we had photos into our system.  “Of course this thing caught me totally off guard, literally shaking me from my sleep. But preparedness is something you make part of your routine as a photojournalist,” Heaps recalled of that morning. “So thankfully, my batteries were charged and my camera bag was pretty much ready to go out the door. Once the shaking stopped, I threw on some clothes, threw the cameras and laptop in my truck and was ready to go out the door.”  After we learned about major damage in Magna at a mobile home community, photographer Jeff Allred was dispatched to that scene. Allred was able to quickly send photos into us for the breaking web story updates, giving our readers a complete and compelling look at the Magna victims’ homes that were badly damaged. With a concern that cellphone towers might be jammed, we switched communication between our photographers to our two-way radio system — a system we invested in a few years earlier for just such scenarios. This also likely allowed our photographers to use their cellular data to send photos into our system. By late morning as things calmed down, Heaps and I were able to make our way into the building to continue coordinating coverage and work on editing the amazing images that were still coming in. Despite the initial plan to work remotely, we felt like we needed to be there. Just like many residents, the aftershocks rattled our nerves throughout the day. But all of us working on the story, including editors, reporters and photographers, knew our readers were counting on us. Here are some of the incredible images captured that day and in the days and weeks that followed by the Deseret News photojournalists.

"Over a dozen dead after massive earthquake hits Greece, Turkey",2020-10-30 22:14 UTC,https://nypost.com/2020/10/30/earthquake-and-tsunami-hit-turkey-and-greece-killing-14/," At least 14 people have been killed and hundreds injured as a powerful earthquake and mini-tsunami hit Turkey and Greece. Horrifying pictures show the mass devastation as rescuers desperately search the rubble for survivors after the magnitude-7.0 tremor rocked the coasts and islands around the Aegean Sea. The quake’s epicenter was 11 miles north of the Greek island Samos off the coast of Turkey, a region popular with British tourists. Izmir, a Turkish city with a population of 4.4 million, bore the brunt of the destruction. At least 20 buildings collapsed and a mini-tsunami swept through coastal areas which swept a flood of debris – including cars – inland and left fish stranded as it receded. People were left running for their lives as the massive surge burst through sea defenses and turned the streets into raging torrents of salt water. Rescuers are now facing a race against time to pull anymore survivors buried beneath the rubble of collapsed structures. At least 70 people have been rescued from under the rubble. The quake was also felt across the eastern Greek islands, such as Mykonos and Kos, and tsunami warnings were issued to many beachgoers. Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) said 12 people died, one due to drowning, while 419 people were injured. Meanwhile, two teenagers, aged 15 and 17, were killed when a wall collapsed on the island of Samos. Turkey’s health ministry said 38 ambulances, two ambulance helicopters and 35 medical rescue teams were working in Izmir. Some two million foreign tourists visit Izmir every year, according to data from the Aegean Touristic Enterprises and Accommodation Union. Pictures and video posted on social media show large clouds of dust rising over the city following the earthquake. Aerial footage on Turkey’s NTV television showed entire city blocks turned to rubble. Rescuers called for silence as they hunted for any signs of survivors, clearing boulders and other debris in a human chain. TRT television showed rescuers being helped by residents and police using chainsaws as they tried to force their way through the rubble. Ilke Cide, a doctoral student who was in Izmir’s Guzelbahce region during the earthquake, said he went inland after waters rose after the earthquake. “I am very used to earthquakes… so I didn’t take it very seriously at first but this time it was really scary,” he said, adding the earthquake had lasted for at least 25-30 seconds. Idil Gungor, who runs a hotel in Izmir’s Seferihisar district, told broadcaster NTV that people were cleaning the debris after the floodwaters receded. She said fish had washed up on the garden of the hotel, around 50 meters from the shore.  Following the news of the earthquake, Greece’s Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias reached out to his Turkish counterpart and offered to send some members of their disaster relief team to Izmir. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan today, offering condolences. “Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,” Mitsotakis wrote on Twitter. The French interior minister, Gérald Darmanin tweeted to say France “stands alongside the Turkish and Greek people”. “If the governments of these countries so wish, French aid can be immediately dispatched on the spot,” Mr Darmanin said. It comes after tensions between the two countries following the publication of a cartoon of the Turkish president in the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The mayor of Izmir’s Seferihisar, Ismail Yetiskin, has said the earthquake caused a rise in sea levels. “There seems to be a small tsunami,” he told broadcaster NTV. Residents fled their homes, while some rockfalls were reported and a mini-tsunami surged into Samos. One of the fallen buildings on the island is the church of Panagia Theotokou in Karlovasi. “The walls of some houses have crumbled and several buildings are damaged,” the island’s deputy mayor Michalis Mitsios was quoted as saying by public broadcaster ERT. “It was chaos,” added fellow deputy mayor Giorgos Dionysiou. “We have never experienced anything like this.” The island’s airport was also closed as a precaution. The Greek civil protection agency told Samos’s residents in a text message to “stay out in the open and away from buildings”. President Erdogan tweeted that he was ready to help “with all the means available to our state”. Turkish environment and urban planning minister Murat Kurum confirmed people remain trapped under the wreckage in Izmir.  “I saw that all my belongings started to fall. My mother was caught in the house. I saw my mother at the street door and everyone was outside. “I entered the house during the aftershocks and I saw that there were cracks in the columns. “According to him, some old buildings are in ruins. The shaking lasted 40-45 seconds.” Witnesses said people flooded onto the streets in the popular tourist city after the quake struck. Turkish officials and broadcasters have called on people to stay off the roads so emergency vehicles can move quickly to the disaster zone. The quake struck at around 11.50am GMT and was felt along Turkey’s Aegean coast and the northwestern Marmara region. Turkeys Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency said the earthquake was centered in the Aegean Sea at a depth of 10.3 miles. Seismologist Efthymios Lekkas told Greek state television ERT that it was still too early to say whether this was the main earthquake. “It was a very big earthquake, it’s difficult to have a bigger one,” said Lekkas. The earthquake is an event that is evolving, Lekkas said, adding that damage had been reported in parts of Samos. A tsunami warning was issued, with residents of the Samos area told to stay away from the coastline.  Aftershocks continue to rattle the area. Water rose above the dock in the main harbor of Samos and flooded the street. The regional governor of the Samos region, Yiannis Stamoulis, said no injuries had been reported on the island.    “People are panicking. They have gone out in the squares, in the streets.”  Greece and Turkey are both situated in one of the world’s most active earthquake zones. In 1999, a 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey’s northwest, killing more than 17,000 people, including 1,000 in Istanbul. Another quake in 2011 in the southeastern province of Van resulted in more than 600 deaths. In Greece, the last deadly quake killed two people on the island of Kos, near Samos, in July 2017."
2.8 magnitude earthquake reported near Sparta,2020-10-25 14:42 UTC,https://myfox8.com/news/2-8-magnitude-earthquake-reported-near-sparta/,"FOX8 WGHP Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. — Sparta felt another earthquake over two months after an earthquake led to hundreds of cases of damage in the town.  The damage left behind after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck Sparta on Aug. 9 was worse than initially thought, according to the Town of Sparta. “We are hearing continuous rumbles throughout our community here in town and in Alleghany County, but we thank the Good Lord to this day that there have been no injuries or fatalities,” Mayor Wes Brinegar said during a Tuesday news conference. While damage assessments are still ongoing, the Town of Sparta had received about 525 reports of damage as of the close of business Monday, Emergency Management Director Daniel Shoffner said. 60 of these cases have been categorized as “major damage,” meaning they lost 40% or more in value. “We underestimated the damage and that was the number one thing. We were looking for major damage in our initial reports, but now, it’s coming out more and more with damage more widespread and severe,” Brinegar said. Brinegar said many of the people living in Sparta, especially those in the older population, are dealing with the emotional trauma that comes with having a natural disaster. And having 20 aftershocks since the earthquake hasn’t helped. “We’re still getting those aftershocks and those loud booms periodically. A lot of people are on edge right now and a lot of people have those issues because they’re paranoid right now,” Brinegar said. The Estep sisters didn’t return back to even look at the damage until Tuesday — more than a week after the quake. They own three side-by-side properties that have all been deemed unlivable. “Our parents were here first and all total 54 years,” Mary Estep said. In those 54 years, a lot of memories have been made there. “All the Christmas’ all the holidays, birthday, Thanksgiving was here,” Mary Estep said. In a matter of seconds, everything changed. “All of a sudden it was like a bomb went off. Everything was flying and shaking, and it was terrifying. Only thing I was thinking was, ‘I got to get her out of the kitchen,’” Mary Estep said. As the quake shook photos, books and home décor off the walls and shelves, she was in the living room frantically trying to get to her sister Alice Estep. “She was yelling ‘get out, get out.’ And I was saying ‘I’m right here, I’m right here,’” Alice Estep said. Hanging on to one another, the two women made it to the door only to find that it was blocked from the outside. A neighbor was able to get them out. They own these two homes and the apartments in the middle. All three properties are beyond repair. “This is a loss completely to us. We just don’t know where to turn, or what to do,” Alice Estep said. While it’s going to take months for some people, cleanup efforts have begun for those who’ve documented their damages. The emergency management report for damage assessment has been sent to state officials. “We are very much relying on state and federal officials to help put the people in this county,” said Daniel Roten, Alleghany County Emergency Management coordinator. He’s hopeful the county will get some money to assist individuals in this time of need. “As its been mentioned before, no one here had earthquake insurance — maybe a handful. I can count them on one hand,” Roten said. Unfortunately, with every tragedy, Brinegar said it seems like there’s someone trying to profit off of it. He said scammers are creating GoFundMe pages asking people to donate. The Red Cross is now housing 19 people from 10 families. The city doesn’t have an official GoFundMe for the victims. Brinegar said all assistance will go through the American Red Cross and they do have a fund called “Sparta Alleghany County North Carolina Earthquake.” Shoffner says the school system did sustain some damage during the earthquake. The school system has taken the necessary steps to ensure the safety of students and faculty. The area felt eight tremors before the earthquake, as well as 20 aftershocks. The 5.1 earthquake centered in Sparta was felt across North Carolina.  Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. The 5.1 magnitude earthquake in Sparta was the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. THE LATEST HEADLINES FROM FOX8

2.9 magnitude among eight aftershocks reported since major earthquake in N.C.,2020-08-11 22:29 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/11/magnitude-among-eight-aftershocks-reported-since-major-earthquake-nc/,"SPARTA, N.C. (WBTV) - A 2.9 magnitude earthquake has been the strongest of eight aftershocks reported since Sunday’s 5.1 near Sparta, North Carolina.  This is according to the United States Geological Survey.  USGS released their aftershock forecast soon after the major quake happened on Sunday. Before the 5.1 magnitude earthquake, the area had roughly eight smaller earthquakes starting Saturday, ranging from a magnitude 1.8 to a magnitude 2.6. Sunday’s 5.1 magnitude earthquake was felt by thousands of people in the Charlotte area. It is one of the largest earthquakes ever reported in the state.  The earthquake was recorded at a depth of 3.7 kilometers. USGS says the largest earthquake in the N.C. area occurred in 1916. As referenced in the United States Geological Survey Professional Paper 1527, in 1916 there was a magnitude 5.2 earthquake, with an intensity of VII (7) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, near Skyland in Buncombe County.

What is an earthquake swarm? California's tremors explained,2020-08-11 20:30 UTC,https://www.inverse.com/science/earthquake-swarm-california-predictions-explained,"The chances of a big quake on the West coast are ""significantly greater than usual.""  Beginning Monday, parts of California were hit with an earthquake swarm that has scientists concerned that a larger-scale quake could be on its way.  Earthquake swarms are clusters of quakes occurring close to one another in both space and time. The earthquake swarm pinpointed to southern California began beneath the Salton Sea, located near Joshua Tree National Park. It's also located just south of the San Andreas fault — which stoked concerns over whether the swarm could trigger a larger-scale, more dangerous tremor.  As of Tuesday, the largest earthquake in the swarm has been a 4.6 magnitude. In the most likely scenario, subsequent quakes could reach a 5.4 magnitude, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). The chances of that being the largest quake are about 80 percent. The USGS expects the rate of earthquakes to drop in the next week or so. While the scenario of a 5.4 or lower quake is the most likely, the agency also estimates that, over the next seven days, there's a 19 percent chance of a 5.5 to 6.9 quake and a 1 percent chance of a quake with a magnitude of 7 or higher.    ""It's a really active area right there in the Sea. Lots of small earthquakes and they tend to be swarmy,"" Morgan Page, a research geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told LAist. ""In the past, these swarms have gone on for about a week or so.""  While earthquake swarms can cause some concern for those living near the area, these are naturally occurring events with some curious science behind them. Here's what you need to know.  They are clusters of earthquakes, which are typically on the smaller side, and tend to recur in the same areas — like the current swarm near the San Andreas fault. Most earthquake swarms are caused by geothermal activity.   Aftershocks occur after a larger ""mainshock"" earthquake happens on a fault. The phenomenon is part of the land readjusting after the main earthquake. This can last for just a few days or weeks — or it can happen for years after a very large earthquake.  In contrast, earthquake swarms don't have a detectable main event that triggers them. They tend to be smaller all-around, and short-lived in comparison to aftershocks.   ""No one can predict the exact time or place of any earthquake, including aftershocks or events in swarms,"" the USGS said in a statement about the ongoing earthquake swarm in California.    However, USGS does use forecasts to broadly understand the likelihood of earthquakes and swarms happening in the future. They use data from past tremors to make predictions including how long the swarm will last.   Is the ongoing earthquake swarm building toward the 'Big One'? — The California earthquake swarm is concerning because of its proximity to a major fault line. The swarm ""does increase the chance of a big earthquake on the San Andreas somewhat,” Morgan Page from USGS told the LA Times. “So it’s definitely something to watch.” Given the unpredictability of earthquakes, this does not necessarily mean that something bigger is on its way. However, as Inverse reported the last time this area had an earthquake swarm, preparing for the Big One is better than not — so if you're in an area potentially affected by earthquakes, it would be well-advised to visit the USGS site for tips on how to prepare.

     The earthquake, one of the largest on record for the region, hit about 1 mile outside of Sparta, North Carolina.

""If a fault could open up, no earthquake would occur in the first place because there would be no friction locking the two blocks together,"" the agency notes. 5 OF THE MOST DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKES IN US HISTORY Locals in Sparta told the Charlotte Observer the disturbed ground is actually a cattle rut where cows frequently travel.

On Monday, the USGS said it received over 100,000 reports from people who felt the quake. The USGS said the population in the affected region resides in structures “that are resistant to earthquake shaking, though vulnerable structures exist.” The quake was felt in nearby states, including Virginia, South Carolina, and Tennessee.

5.1 magnitude earthquake rattles the Charlotte-area,2020-08-09 19:08 UTC,https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/weather/did-you-feel-an-earthquake-in-charlotte/275-c4e0828a-6b8a-4d45-9b90-0f82b4297382,"Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Did you feel that?  According to Chief Meteorologist Brad Panovich, a 5.1 magnitude earthquake was reported near Sparta, North Carolina Sunday morning at around 8 a.m.  Sunday's tremor was the location of Saturday's 2.3 magnitude earthquake. There were no immediate reports of injuries, though many people in Sparta shared photos and videos of minor damage caused by the earthquake.  The U.S. Geological Service said the quake’s epicenter was about 2.5 miles (four kilometers) southeast of Sparta. Panovich said this would be the biggest quake in North Carolina since the 5.1 magnitude quake in 1916 near Asheville. Some reports place it as the third-largest North Carolina earthquake on record.  Panovich said Saturday's 2.6 magnitude, in the same location, was a foreshock. Hours after the earthquake, two aftershocks were reported with one registering at 1.8 magnitude and another 1.7 magnitude.  ""I would expect many small aftershocks over the next few days,"" Panovich said. The chairman of the Alleghany County Board of Commissioners signed a declaration of a State of Emergency in Alleghany County in response to the earthquake.  ""I've never been so scared in my entire life,” said Sparta resident Erica Swenk. The aftermath left Swenk’s home in chaos.  ""My pictures and everything on the floor and all of the broken glass, immediately it just triggers emotions, those are your memories so I started crying,” Swenk said.  She said the shaking was so intense she wasn’t sure if she would survive, she’s thankful her kids were out of town. ""If I was going to see them again, I'm glad I lived through it and I've gotten to speak to them and know mommy’s okay and I think that's what's most important,” Swenk said. The earthquake was felt by many in the Charlotte area as well. Phil Brooks, a Charlotte resident, said he felt his bed shaking — saying he was ""pretty traumatized"" by the event.  Endora Crawford, another Charlotte resident, looked at it a little differently.  ""It's been that kind of year,"" Crawford said. ""Anything that happens is not a surprise."" Contributing information from the Associated Press. Who also felt that? A little ground rumbling this Sunday morning.

Anybody else just feel an #earthquake? Woke me up in Greensboro, NC. A 5.1 earthquake is very strong for this area. According to the USGS database, this is the strongest earthquake to hit North Carolina in more than 100 years. That dates back to the 1916 5.2 quake near Skyland, NC close to Asheville.  You may remember a large earthquake back in 2011. That was a 5.8 that hit near Richmond, VA and was felt up and down the East Coast, including the Triad.   We are working to get more info on any possible damage associated with the earthquake. Earthquakes of this size can rattle homes and foundations and cause some structural damage.   Dwayne Young in Stokes County sent us a photo of a crack in the ceiling of his garage.  It is unknown if there will be any aftershocks. If so, they would most likely be weaker than the initial earthquake. There was a smaller 2.6 magnitude earthquake 1 a.m. in the same area, which is considered a foreshock.  You can report that you felt the earthquake by sending a report to the USGS.  LIVE: This earthquake woke me up! Maybe it did for you too. 

What did you feel? 
Do you have any damage? 

Strongest in about 100 years for NC! You can also text us at 336-379-5775 to tell us where you were and what you were doing when you felt the earthquake. Make sure to leave your name and where you're texting from. Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings."

"6.5 earthquake rattles western Nevada, closes highway",2020-05-15 11:51 UTC,https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-nevada/6-5-earthquake-rattles-western-nevada-closes-highway-2028663/,"A magnitude-6.5 earthquake struck in remote western Nevada near Tonopah early Friday, damaging U.S. Highway 95 in several areas and causing its closure until early afternoon. A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck in remote western Nevada near Tonopah early Friday, damaging U.S. Highway 95 in several areas and causing its closure until early afternoon.  The quake’s depth was estimated to be 4.7 miles.  The largest repair entailed a 9-foot-wide-by-40-foot-long pavement patch. Permanent repairs will be scheduled in the future, although it’s too early yet to determine the cost and timeline. Photos from Esmeralda County showed a crack several inches wide running through both lanes of the highway. Mineral County Sheriff’s Office dispatcher Jim Kenner said residents in the county got a good shaking. “We’ve got a lot of calls from frightened residents, but none of them report any damage,” he said. Nye County Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said the earthquake shook “the northern portion of Nye and Esmeralda counties.” “A cursory windshield survey discovered some broken windows in Tonopah,” Wehrly said. “Patrol officers were sent north due to a report of damage to Highway 95 and possible damage in Gabbs.” The sheriff’s office said it would provide additional updates if more damage is discovered. Nye County spokesman Arnold Knightly said that as of midmorning, there had been 23 magnitude 3 or higher aftershocks following the initial quake. One aftershock was listed as magnitude 5. “Over the next week, there is a 4 percent chance of one or more aftershocks that are larger than 6.5,” Knightly said. “It is likely that there will be smaller earthquakes over the next week with 3 magnitudes or higher.” Knightly said Nye County government infrastructure was not damaged. “There are reports of broken storefront glass, stress cracks on asphalt streets, loose hanging signs, items knocked off shelves and some minor lifting of sidewalks,” Knightly said. “Overall, everything appears to be sound at this point; however, we have learned that other than obvious earthquake damage, some damage is discovered later.” He said there were no reports of significant damage in Gabbs, which is about 75 miles north of Tonopah. Groceries off the shelves in Tonopah Keith Hasty works at the Super 7 gas station on Main Street in Tonopah. He said the earthquake shook the store and rattled nerves but caused no major damage that he knew of. “It really shook a lot of groceries off the shelves,” Hasty said. He said he was working since midnight and, after the quake struck, local residents who frequented the store were all talking about the quake.  “We have a lot of locals coming in saying their TVs were shaking, they felt it,” Hasty said. Tonopah resident Susan Jesionowski said she woke up to find her 120-year-old house shaking from the earthquake. “I live in a house behind the post office and my whole house shaked, rattled and rolled,” Jesionowski said. “The whole entire house was just rolling. I had canned goods go everywhere.” Jesionowski is the manager of the Tonopah Motel in downtown Tonopah, but the motel is closed for renovations. A voice message on the phone line at the historic Mizpah Hotel in Tonopah early Friday also indicated the hotel was closed for renovations. Some people reported on social media that they felt the earthquake in Las Vegas, San Francisco and Utah. This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

Review-Journal staff writers Katelyn Newberg and Julie Wootton-Greener contributed to this report. DETR said there has been an estimated $1.4 billion in overpayments, and about $644 million were fraudulent while $784 million was attributed to non-fraud improper payments. Culinary Union 226 isn’t yet ready to welcome the Oakland Athletics to Las Vegas with open arms. UNLV professor Pradip Bhowmik invented a fire retardant polymer that reduces the likelihood of lithium-ion batteries catching fire, which can be crucial as more electric vehicles hit the road. Individuals under the age of 21 may soon be barred from possessing certain semiautomatic firearms after lawmakers in the Assembly voted to advance the measure. Calls to the Nevada Department of Wildlife about wildlife encounters saw a 657% increase from 2018 to 2019. A 22-year-old man was arrested and charged with murder after he allegedly shot and killed a 37-year-old man at a North Las Vegas residence in February. Candida auris cases in Southern Nevada “have been alarmingly trending in the wrong direction,” the delegation states in a letter to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. Nevada’s unemployment rate in March didn’t budge from the previous month, remaining at 5.5 percent. With inflation persisting, it’s reassuring to know there are plenty of things to do and see in Las Vegas that don’t cost a dime. After dropping more than 50 feet since 2000, latest forecasts show Lake Mead rising by roughly 22 feet by the end of the year.

Earthquake near Boise rattles 3-state area; no major damage reported,2020-04-01 01:04 UTC,https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nation-and-world/earthquake-near-boise-rattles-3-state-area-no-major-damage-reported-1995999/,"The earthquake is added stress during an already stressful time for the region. BOISE, Idaho — An earthquake struck north of Boise Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking. The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana, and Salt Lake City, Utah. The 6.5 earthquake near Stanley, Idaho was the 2nd-largest earthquake in the world over the past 30 days. pic.twitter.com/50ZoCtXRSF — NWS Boise (@NWSBoise) April 1, 2020   Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke’s Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn’t interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho’s coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation’s highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. “It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said. The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.” 

Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it.
“I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I’m sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.”
Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay.
That quake was along what scientists call a “normal fault,” with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday’s quake appeared to be on an unmapped “strike-slip fault,” causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line.
“This is one that wasn’t obvious enough to be mapped before now,” Jones said.
Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they’re less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists.
Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake.
“An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn’t surprise us,” she said. “They do every bit as much damage.”
People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said.
“Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,” Jones said. “Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake. Just get down and try to cover.”

Lies have consequences,” said Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson in a news conference outside the courthouse after the announcement. Gunfire that erupted on busy highway in Maine is linked to a second crime scene where four people were found dead in a home. Oklahoma’s governor is calling for the resignations of the four officials, one of whom also apparently made racist remarks in an audio recording. No people or satellites were aboard for this attempt. There won’t be another try until at least Wednesday. About 150 people walked at a Summerlin park on Sunday to raise awareness about antisemitism and to preserve the memory of the Holocaust.

Footage from the scene showed mothers dressed in nightgowns hugging their newborn babies in a parking lot as they evacuated a damaged maternity hospital amid freezing temperatures. The women, newborn babies and incubators were being moved to a new location with the help of the army. Zagreb’s iconic cathedral was also damaged, with the top of one of its two spires collapsing. The cathedral was rebuilt after it toppled in the 1880 earthquake. Power was cut as people ran out of their homes. Several fires were also reported. Residents shared photos of belongings falling off shelves, broken bottles and glass inside homes. Officials first said a 15-year-old was killed, but doctors later said that she was in critical condition and that they were fighting to save her life. They gave no immediate details on the extent of other injuries. The earthquake struck amid a partial lockdown of the capital because of the spread of the coronavirus. People were told to avoid public areas, such as parks and public squares, but had little choice as they fled their residences. Up to five people are allowed to be together while keeping a distance.

(AP Photo/Darko Bandic) Health Minister Vili Beros warned people to keep a 2-meter (7-foot) “social distance” as requested by decrees passed by the government in an attempt to prevent the spread of COVID-19. There are 235 coronavirus cases confirmed so far in Croatia. “Earthquakes are dangerous, but coronavirus is even more so,” Beros said, as people rushed out of their homes to congregate in city parks. Some of Zagreb residents disagreed. “Earthquakes are more important than the coronavirus. If the earthquake hits, and you are under a door, you worry about yourself first and then the mask later,” Paul, a man from Peru who lives in Zagreb, told a local TV station. He gave only his first name. Plenkovic, the prime minister, urged citizens to remain calm and return to their homes where possible in the central parts of Zagreb, which sustained the most damage. “We have two parallel crisis that contradict each other,” Plenkovic said after an emergency meeting of Croatia’s top officials. Croatian soldiers wearing masks and carrying shovels could be seen helping efforts to clear the damage on the streets of Zagreb. Top officials toured the damaged areas as some citizens criticized city authorities over the poor states of buildings in the old part of the city, some of which date to the 19th century. “We will try to clear the streets as soon as possible,” the prime minister said. “Stay outside your homes and keep distance.” Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic said the situation was complicated by the restrictive virus-related measures in place. “We face two simultaneous crises, one is unpredictable and the other is invisible,” Bozinovic said. “There are rules for when there is an earthquake, but when there is an earthquake at the same time when there is a global pandemic, then it’s a much more complex situation,” he said.

Did COVID-19 and an earthquake raise your anxiety? You're not alone,2020-03-19 04:00 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2020/3/18/21185656/covid-19-utah-coronavirus-earthquake-anxiety-primary-childrens-ogden-regional-children-seniors,"Candy Whisler hugs her scared dog Athena and grandson Paris Whisler after a 5.7 magnitude earthquake centered in Magna hit on Wednesday, March 18, 2020. Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — Shortly after a 5.7 magnitude earthquake hit the Wasatch Front Wednesday morning, a woman and a couple of her friends were tossing bricks from the shattered chimney of her downtown bungalow-style home.  “It feels like a bit much,” said the woman, who declined to offer her name. “Seriously. This is a lot.” Loreen Sjoblom felt the same way after she was violently shaken awake in Midvale by the earthquake. She and her husband Ron have been leading a pretty quiet existence at home since the novel coronavirus pandemic reached Utah, obeying public health instructions to keep away from others because he’s 70 and she’s 69. Age puts them at higher risk of complications — and though they’ve tried to make light of any danger, they don’t want  to take any chances. Adding an earthquake to the uncertainty of COVID-19 feels a little “ridiculous, just too much,” she said. “I’m thinking, it’s odd the way it’s all piling on.” She’s more worried than she wants to admit, even to herself, she said. “I’m telling myself I’m not stressing, but I was calling everyone to make sure they were OK. Sometimes I lie to myself about what I feel.” Experts say northern Utah residents can be forgiven if they’re feeling overwhelmed, even spooked, after an earthquake was layered on top of their fears about a pandemic. “In cases of multiple stresses, having high levels of distress is normal,” said Dana Garfin, assistant professor at University of California Irvine’s Sue & Bill Groves School of Nursing. One of her specialties is repeated exposure to trauma and she said this certainly counts. “In the acute aftermath of a traumatic event, people experience higher levels of stress.”  The adversities have piled on incrementally, from the threat of potentially serious illness for some, to supply shortages, job hours cut back or eliminated, people told to work from home, businesses and schools closing, social lives halted, child care worries, reduced incomes and more. The experience of children and senior citizens has been remarkably parallel, but working-age adults are sharing the stress of both age groups, while dealing with other pressures of their own. There was nothing slow about the trauma of the earthquake. That hit fast and then was followed up with little gut punches for several hours in the form of aftershocks. Taking a significant ongoing traumatic experience and adding another amplifies anxiety. said Keeshin. “They add on in terms of potential impact. Someone who might not be too bothered by the earthquake normally might be bothered a fair amount more than one would expect” right now. People in the same household or identical situations may be reacting very differently. That’s normal, too, Garfin said. The first tremors and aftershocks had subsided and the staff was having lunch in a private dining room at Pacifica Senior Living in Millcreek when a significant aftershock — reported at magnitude 4.6 — rattled workers along with the tableware. They immediately got up to check residents who are mostly staying in their rooms as part of social distancing to avoid COVID-19. “Be calm,” Stephanie Klingbiel, executive director, said she warned staff, knowing the residents would take their cue from how their caregivers were acting. Besides nerves from knowing they are at risk, the senior citizens’ routines have changed, too. Area care centers and senior living programs have canceled outside activities and outings. The senior citizens are not going out even for doctor appointments unless they are unavoidable.  Ditto for kids and whole families. The youngsters find themselves with time off from school — but no ability to play with their friends. Will they go back to class soon? There’s a lot of uncertainty. For older students, will graduations take place on time? Will important events — what about the prom — be canceled?  Garfin said people like their difficulties to be acknowledged. But they also need to know that they’re not helpless.  While they can’t control the pandemic or the earthquake, they can control what they do. Garfin said following the public health recommendations for COVID-19 and advice from officials in natural disasters gives one a sense of command and also opens the door to options for helping others. Many, like Sjoblom, find strength in checking in with loved ones, commiserating and seeing if they can help each other. It’s a natural and healthy response. “I think reaching out to people, letting them know they’re not alone, they are part of a community, is great. There are people they can turn to even if maybe not in the way they are used to,” Garfin said. The seniors at Legacy Village of Sugar House, a senior living community with a continuum of services, have been grateful for a community response to COVID-19 that makes keeping older people safe a priority, though they are more isolated from family and friends, said executive director Dave Egbert. They’re used to congregating for meals, so eating in their rooms has been a big change, Some find it a bit disconcerting, so the staff has tried to lighten things up by visiting often and being cheerful. Positivity is as contagious as gloom — and more enjoyable. It’s a skill to trot out during crisis, he said. With activities canceled, everyone has more time to worry, from the senior citizens to the high school seniors and the children whose routines were disrupted. Those who are elderly have a longer perspective. They’ve already been through more. Egbert said life may have helped them be prepared emotionally for recent unsettling events. Elevated stress hormones wreak havoc on every part of the body, so learning how to calm oneself down becomes really important, according to Jennifer James, a registered dietitian nutritionist and certified health coach at Ogden Regional Medical Center. She said people are often not taught to manage their emotions in a constructive way. It’s a good idea to acknowledge how you’re feeling, even if you’re feeling really bad. Author Brene Brown writes that verbalizing a feeling and processing it without trying to change it can allow the feeling to pass naturally and a person to be resilient. People in serious distress should meet with a counselor. During this pandemic, many therapists are meeting with patients online. Simple, readily available tools may help, including meditation, writing in a journal, keeping a gratitude journal or turning to a hobby or activity that’s enjoyable. Meditation is mentioned often by experts as a way to lower stress. James said it changes the structure and function of the brain, helping people be calmer, more circumspect, and less emotional in hard situations. She suggests making it a regular part of a day. “It’s something I sometimes have to make myself do, like brushing my teeth. I do it to be healthy. It’s not always enjoyable. But I am a better listener, more focused, more relaxed and I do not react to things as strongly as I would in the past,” she said. She teaches cardio rehab patients to meditate. Garfin likes that meditation can be done whenever and wherever. There are a lot of great free apps to help someone learn. She said it lowers the sympathetic nervous system response. Stress is chronically activated in the aftermath of trauma unless it’s calmed down. But lowing that internal level of anxiety and the physiological response has mental and physical benefits.  Prayer has effects that are similar to meditation. Exercise is another tool to reduce stress. Exercise doesn’t have to be strenuous, but can be matched to the level and capability of the person doing it.  And even with social distancing, people can find ways to plug into their favorite activities and rituals. Many churches, mosques and synagogues, for instance, are still holding services that can be viewed online. “People are probably going to be experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress,” said Garfin, as well as manageable levels of panic. They won’t last forever. They should use the available resources they find helpful.  Though this particular earthquake was significant, it wasn’t massive. Children were likely not unsafe, but it’s natural if their response is disproportionate, Keeshin said. Their bodies were primed to be in a “ready-for-danger” position by the coronavirus outbreak. “Add another on top of it and the response is magnified.” In homes where the power was out, many kids couldn’t even do some of the things that might normally settle them down, like go online and reach out to friends. Parents need to talk to their kids about what’s going on, being open and honest and answer questions  Keeshin said to use developmentally appropriate language and have the conversations in a setting where everyone involved can really focus.  How you approach possible trauma matters. Asking open-ended questions is better than suggesting how someone feels. It also opens the door to answer the questions a child really wants to ask. If the earthquake is the issue, you can talk about how to be safe. In a power outage, maybe they’re worried more about no internet to make sure their grandparents are safe than whether there’s no light. “You can’t assume what’s distressing or most bothersome for kids,” Keeshin said. It takes a conversation.  The advice for children is helpful for adults who are anxious, too.  “Caregivers and others could be feeling those exact same things. It’s OK. It’s a normal, natural response,” Keeshin said. “It’s OK for you to take the time necessary to deal with it or to help problem-solve or mitigate.” The National Child Traumatic Stress Network has a fact sheet to help parents talk to their children about COVID-19, answering questions and guiding a conversation in age-sensitive ways. It’s a model for talking about other stressors, too. Children at different ages have different trauma reactions and the best approach varies. Keeshin said if a child was already highly anxious or struggling before COVID-19 or the earthquake, it’s really appropriate to call the pediatrician and ask for some additional guidance. Just don’t take them into the office; health officials are asking people to avoid physical visits that might expose more people to COVID-19.  “Stay positive,” said Klingbiel. “You can’t function if you’re with someone who is negative.”  Copyright © 2023 Deseret News Publishing Company.

 A strong earthquake struck Salt Lake City on Wednesday, damaging some roads and buildings, shutting down a major air traffic hub and scaring millions of people already on edge from the coronavirus pandemic.  The 5.7-magnitude quake just after 7 a.m. showered bricks onto sidewalks, sent a chemical plume into the air outside the city and damaged a spire and statue atop the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ iconic Salt Lake Temple.  The epicenter was just southwest of Salt Lake City, between the city’s international airport and the Great Salt Lake. The temblor and its aftershocks were felt by about 2.8 million people. Most were hunkered down inside their homes to prevent the spread of the coronavirus when buildings started shaking, and many ran outside to the streets in panic. “This is extremely bad timing, because we already have the coronavirus issue going on right now causing a lot of anxiety,” Gov. Gary Herbert said.  Operations at Salt Lake City International Airport came to a halt, planes were diverted and the control tower and concourses were evacuated.  Far fewer people than normal were in the airport. On a typical travel day, the airport would have had about 24,000 people inside it and more making connections. But there were just 9,000 there, said the airport’s executive director, Bill Wyatt, making an evacuation of the terminal easier. Marsha Guertzgen of Evanston, Wyo., was about to board a flight when the quake struck and said “pandemonium and chaos” immediately erupted in the terminal – only to be heightened by each aftershock.  “Everybody was running around, they were scared I don’t think they knew what was going on,” she said. “People were screaming, kids were screaming, people were climbing under things.” No runway damage was found and most of the damage in the terminal appeared to be caused by a broken water line, Wyatt said. Cargo and non-commercial flights resumed late Wednesday morning, but commercial flights were delayed into the afternoon. The quake also shut down the light rail service for Salt Lake City and its suburbs. It caused the release of chemicals at Kennecott copper mine west of Salt Lake City, creating a visible plume that moved toward the Great Salt Lake, said Clint Mecham, Salt Lake County’s emergency manager. Officials have not identified the chemicals sent into the air in the plume, but Mecham said it was not expected to affect people since it’s moving away from populated areas.  Residents reported feeling shaking across a 100-mile (160 kilometer) area, with the heaviest impact in Salt Lake County, officials said.  Some residents ran from their homes and into the streets as they felt the earthquake shake buildings for 10 to 15 seconds. The underlying concern about the coronavirus outbreak was evident in the response to the quake. Paramedics and fire crews responding to emergency calls asked people to first disclose if they have symptoms. If they did, the crews geared up with masks, gowns and gloves before attending to them, officials said. Health officials’ coronavirus response operations were briefly disrupted by the earthquake. Some virus testing was delayed and the state’s coronavirus hotline was temporarily shut down while damage assessments were conducted.  Michelle Daneri, 30, said the coronavirus outbreak had kept her mostly inside her Salt Lake City home since last Friday, but she emerged from it after the quake to search for her frightened cat. She chatted with her neighbors outside but stood apart from them. “We’re trying to check on each other but we’re also trying to keep our distance,” Daneri said. “I think we at least stood about 5 feet away from each other.” The experience made her wonder how to take precautions against the virus if she could not stay in her home.  “It makes me feel a little bit on edge in my house, when that felt like a safe space,” Daneri said. There were reports of damage in Salt Lake City and in the communities of Magna and Kearns, but authorities said they did not expect it to be severe. Fire officials in Magna said 14 structures were damaged. There was damage to roads and bridges and natural gas leaks were reported at state government buildings, said Utah Commissioner of Public Safety Jess Anderson. In Salt Lake City, bricks fell off the side of a homeless shelter and the Salt Lake Temple sustained minor damage, with the trumpet held by the Angel Moroni falling from the statue at the top of the temple and stones displaced from a spire. The temple is undergoing renovations and a seismic upgrade. Construction crews were sent home while the damage is being assessed, church spokesman Daniel Woodruff said in a statement. But authorities did not expect to find severe damage in most structures, said Dougherty, the emergency management spokesman.  “We’re hearing of lights falling down, bookcases falling down, we’ve heard of water lines breaking inside of buildings,” Dougherty said.  People reported feeling the quake in the neighboring states of Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming and Nevada.  About 73,000 homes and businesses lost electricity in the Salt Lake City area, but power was quickly being restored in some areas, said utility Rocky Mountain Power. It was the largest earthquake to hit Utah since a 5.9 magnitude quake shook southern Utah in 1992, according to Utah Emergency Management.

 Duenet Alexand (left) and Berthenid Dasny have been maintaining the grounds at the St. Christophe memorial at Titanyen, north of Port-au-Prince, where thousands of earthquake victims were buried in mass graves. On the wind-whipped hills north of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, Berthenid Dasny holds the keys to the gated memorial erected for Haiti's earthquake victims. Thousands of bodies are buried here in a mass grave dug after a magnitude 7 earthquake shook the country on Jan. 12, 2010. ""They've forgotten about this place; it should look better than this,"" Dasny says as she walks past the overgrown grass, rusted metal statues and brittle brush. For the past year, she has been the memorial's groundskeeper, though she has never been paid. ""You must remember the humans buried here. They were just like us and should always be honored, not forgotten,"" she says. Dasny believes some of her own relatives who were never found after the quake are buried in the grave.

  The earthquake's main shock lasted almost 30 seconds. A series of aftershocks soon followed. An estimated 220,000 died, though Haiti's official estimates are higher. Some 1.5 million people were displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration. About 300,000 were injured, and large parts of the country were buried under tons of twisted metal and concrete.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Donors from around the world swiftly pledged billions of dollars in aid and made promises to rebuild. But a decade on, Haitians who survived say they feel forgotten, as much of the goodwill and billions have been lost to waste, greed and corruption. Elizabonne Casseus, 50, is trying to keep her family afloat. She lives with 17 relatives in a small shelter in Canaan, a slum north of Port-au-Prince inhabited by displaced earthquake survivors. Today, the sprawling array of concrete homes and wooden shacks is home to more than a quarter of a million people. There is no running water; there are no sewers and few roads. 
                Elizabonne Casseus built this shelter (left) using surplus USAID tarps she purchased. She prepares a pot of beans for the more than a dozen people who stay in this shelter.

 Elizabonne Casseus built this shelter (left) using surplus USAID tarps she purchased. She prepares a pot of beans for the more than a dozen people who stay in this shelter. Aid, Casseus says, ""was good for the people that got it, but not for me."" Her flimsy one-room shack is covered with a gray tarp, stamped with logos of the U.S. Agency for International Development. She bought the cover before coming to these windy hills after spending five years in a squalid tent camp near downtown Port-au-Prince. She had hoped the foreign aid would help her repair her home, destroyed in the quake. Haiti has long been the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, and the earthquake only made things worse. In the first year after the quake, the economy contracted by more than 5 %.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Moved by the grisly images of the death and destruction, nations around the world pledged almost $10 billion to Haiti. In addition, $3 billion more was donated to worldwide charities that sent thousands of volunteers to the island. Promises were made for new roads, schools, government buildings and permanent, earthquake-proof housing. Haiti's long-troubled economy was going to be revitalized. While millions poured into Haiti in the first two years after the quake, giving the economy a boost, signs were emerging that reconstruction wouldn't live up to those promises. ""There were so many opportunities after the earthquake that could have reduced so much poverty,"" says Kesner Pharel, a Haitian economist. He calls the last 10 years a ""lost decade."" By 2012, millions of cubic feet of rubble still filled the streets. More than 500,000 people still lived in squalid tent camps, according to the International Organization for Migration.

 Canaan is a slum north of Port-au-Prince inhabited by displaced earthquake survivors. The sprawling array of concrete homes and wooden shacks is home to more than a quarter of a million people. High-profile groups created to help coordinate the flow of aid money stopped operating. The Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, set up to streamline and provide transparency for major aid projects and co-chaired by former President Bill Clinton, had already disbanded by the fall of 2011, and less than half of the $4.6 billion pledged to projects was spent.

Lindar Celhomme (right) looks through a hole in his plywood house in the Corail-Cesselesse settlement, one of the first places outside of Port-au-Prince where displaced earthquake survivors pitched their tents. A 2013 Government Accountability Office investigation found that USAID had underestimated the cost of infrastructure and housing projects, forcing it to substantially reduce the number of homes it originally planned to help build. The GAO also found that most USAID contracts went to non-Haitian companies, leaving local businesses out of any reconstruction boon. And an NPR investigation five years after the quake found that the American Red Cross, which took in half a billion dollars from U.S. donors, had only built six permanent homes, not the 132,000 it had claimed. The Red Cross disputed NPR's reports and objected to findings of opaque bookkeeping and exorbitant overhead costs. Economist Pharel says that on top of the botched reconstruction effort, Haiti's constant political turmoil, weak institutions and poor governance squandered international funds and goodwill. The United Nations has struggled in recent years to get donors to fulfill their aid commitments. Last year, it only met 30% of its funding goals to Haiti, according to the U.N.

 Empty jugs for water sit in a corner of Berthenid Dasny's home. Outside her door sits a large pile of stone and sand that she has been gradually purchasing in hopes of someday building a new home. In recent months, though, citizens have been demanding more accountability from their leaders, not only for the earthquake aid but also for billions of dollars provided to Haiti from an aid program sponsored by Venezuela, known as PetroCaribe. Opponents of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse accuse him of embezzling some of the PetroCaribe funds, and they've taken to the streets demanding he resign. Moïse denies all allegations. This fall, demonstrations turned violent, leaving 50 people dead and more than 100 injured. Schools and businesses were shut down for weeks. Critical food aid, especially outside the capital, couldn't reach much of the population as demonstrators blocked highways and roads. About a million Haitians suffer severe hunger. Human rights advocates say gangs have grown in the midst of the political turmoil. 
                Medical professionals and other protesters demand the resignation of President Jovenel Moïse in Port-au-Prince in October. Moïse has been accused of embezzling aid money.

 Medical professionals and other protesters demand the resignation of President Jovenel Moïse in Port-au-Prince in October. Moïse has been accused of embezzling aid money. But many Haitians are no longer waiting for government or aid groups to build them more permanent homes. Casseus, who relocated to the sprawling slum outside Port-au-Prince, buys sand and stone whenever she has a little extra money so that one day, she can build a more permanent structure on the land she bought. She admits it is slow going for her and her husband, a car mechanic. ""Sometimes he goes out all day long and comes back with no money,"" she says. Dasny, the earthquake memorial's groundskeeper, also hopes for a better place to live. For now, she has cobbled together a two-room house on the dusty hillside where she lives by the mass grave. It is made of wooden slats and corrugated tin that rattles and roars with every gust of wind.

Like Casseus, she keeps a large pile of stone and sand outside her door. When she has work or sells one of her goats, she uses the money to buy stones. She breaks the rocks and adds to the piles, getting ever closer to her goal of building a new home. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor"

     A strong magnitude 6.3 earthquake hit central Croatia on Tuesday, causing major damage to homes and other buildings in a town southeast of the capital. The shakes were felt in neighboring Slovenia. PETRINJA, Croatia (AP) – Aftershocks jolted central Croatia on Wednesday, a day after a 6.3-magnitude earthquake killed at least seven people, injured dozens and left several towns and villages in ruins. The strongest, a 4.7-magnitude tremor, was recorded near the heavily damaged town of Petrinja, some 25 miles southeast of the capital, Zagreb. Many people had spent the night in tents, their cars or military barracks. A rescuer walks past a building damaged in an earthquake in Petrinja, Croatia, Tuesday, Dec. 29, 2020.

ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — A strong earthquake hit central Croatia on Tuesday, destroying buildings and sending panicked people fleeing into rubble-covered streets in a town southeast of the capital. Authorities said five people were killed and at least 20 were injured. The European Mediterranean Seismological Center said a magnitude 6.3 quake hit 46 kilometers (28 miles) southeast of Zagreb. It caused widespread damage in the hardest-hit town of Petrinja. The same area was struck by a 5.2 quake on Monday. Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. Another four people were killed in villages near the town, according to the state HRT television. At least 20 people were hospitalized, two with serious injuries, officials said. “The center of Petrinja as it used to be no longer exists,” HRT reported, saying people remained inside collapsed buildings. “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT. “This is like Hiroshima – half of the city no longer exists.” Marica Pavlovic, a resident, said the quake felt “worse than a war.” “It was horrible, a shock, you don’t know what to do, whether to run out or hide somewhere,” she told The Associated Press. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable,” Plenkovic said. He said the army has 500 places ready in barracks to house people, while others will be accommodated in nearby hotels and other places. “No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” the prime minister said. Officials later toured a damaged hospital in the nearby town of Sisak, which was also badly hit by the earthquake. Plenkovic said the hospital’s patients will be evacuated in army helicopters and in ambulances. Health officials said a baby was delivered in a tent in front of the hospital in the aftermath of the earthquake. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that she spoke with Plenkovic and instructed an envoy to travel to Croatia as soon as possible. As a Mediterranean country, Croatia is prone to earthquakes, but not big ones. The last strong quake struck in the 1990s when the picturesque Adriatic coast village of Ston was destroyed. Regional TV channel N1 reported from Petrinja that a collapsed building had fallen on a car. The footage showed firefighters trying to remove the debris. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the car and carried into an ambulance. Fallen bricks and dust littered the streets as emergency teams used rescue dogs while looking for survivors in the rubble. A woman was found alive some four hours after the earthquake, rescuers said. The Croatian military was deployed in Petrinja to help with the rescue operation.

Several buildings were wrecked in Turkey’s western Izmir province, according to officials, but there was no immediate information on casualties. ISTANBUL — A strong earthquake struck Friday between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, collapsing several buildings in Turkey’s western Izmir province and leaving at least four people dead. Dozens more were injured, while some damage to buildings and the road network, and four light injuries were also reported on Samos. Turkey’s Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted that four people were killed in Izmir and 120 were injured. He said 38 ambulances, two ambulance helicopters and 35 medical rescue teams were working in Izmir. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 with an epicenter 13 kilometers (8 miles) north northeast of the Greek island of Samos. The United States Geological Survey put the magnitude at 7.0. It is common for preliminary magnitudes to differ in the early hours and days after a quake. Multiple aftershocks struck the region.

He said there were small cracks in some buildings in six other provinces. Izmir’s governor said there was no immediate information on casualties. Turkish media said the earthquake was felt across the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul’s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city. A moment during #earthquake in #izmir #Turkey #depremizmir #Deprem #tsunami   — Global News (@GlbBreakNews) October 30, 2020   The quake was felt across the eastern Greek islands and even in the Greek capital Athens. Greek media said the residents of Samos and other islands fled their homes, while some rockfalls were reported. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Turkey and Greece reported aftershocks. The quake was also felt in Bulgaria. Greek seismologist Efthymios Lekkas told Greek state television ERT that it was still too early to say whether this was the main earthquake, although he said it was likely it was. “It is an event that is evolving,” Lekkas said, adding that some damage had been reported in parts of Samos. A tsunami warning was issued, with residents of the Samos area told to stay away from the coastline. Water rose above the dock in the main harbor of Samos and flooded the street. The regional governor of the Samos region, Yiannis Stamoulis, said no injuries had been reported on the island. Residents have also been told to stay away from buildings, as aftershocks continued to rattle the area.

"San Francisco Bay Area earthquake, 31 years later, a look back",2020-10-19 13:33 UTC,https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nation-and-world/san-francisco-bay-area-earthquake-31-years-later-a-look-back-2154783/,"Saturday marked 31 years since a deadly earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area. On Oct. 17, 1989, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the San Francisco Bay Area, killing 67 people. It was the most powerful earthquake to rattle California since the deadly 8.3 quake of 1906 that killed more than 3,000 and leveled much of San Francisco. That quake lasted up to 60 seconds, according to news accounts. The 1989 quake lasted only 10 to 15 but caused more than $5 billion in damage.   Former Review-Journal columnists Royce Feour and Norm Clarke were at Candlestick Park that night and shared memories of what happened. According to the California Department of Conservation, “the epicenter was on the San Andreas fault roughly 56 miles south of San Francisco and 10 miles northeast of Santa Cruz, near Mt. Loma Prieta in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The earthquake was felt as far away as western Nevada. Now, more than 30 years later, the earthquake is just a footnote in history as the anniversary passed this weekend with nary a remembrance of the physical and psychological toll it took on the Bay Area. Prosecutors plan to drop an involuntary manslaughter charge against Alec Baldwin in the fatal 2021 shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the Western film ” Rust.” SpaceX’s giant new rocket blasted off on its first test flight Thursday but exploded minutes after rising from the launch pad and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. “The truth matters.

Google turns Android phones into an earthquake detection network,2020-08-11 13:00 UTC,https://www.engadget.com/google-android-detect-earthquake-130041374.html,"In a natural disaster like an earthquake, even a few seconds’ heads up could save lives. You could use that time to get you and your loved ones somewhere safe and prevent fatalities and injuries. Google is rolling out a feature today that not only gives you an early warning about potential earthquakes happening, but also turns your phone into a mini seismometer and makes it part of a network of shockwave-detecting Android devices. “The public infrastructure to detect and alert everyone about an earthquake is costly to deploy,” Google’s principal software engineer of Android Marc Stogaitis said in a blog post today. Not everyone is signed up to receive text alerts, for example, so if the early warning system is built into the OS, these messages can reach more people. Google first collaborated with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services to send these alerts to Android devices in California via the USGS’ ShakeAlert system. This uses information gathered from more than 700 seismometers across the state to figure out when an earthquake is taking place. But it can be costly or challenging to install such a network in other impacted areas around the world, which is where the Android Earthquake Alerts System comes in. Users all over the world can opt into the program starting today. “Your Android phone can turn into a mini seismometer, joining millions of other Android phones out there to form the world’s largest earthquake detection network,” Stogaitis said. Google will use your phone’s accelerometer to detect the movement. Stogaitis said “They’re even sensitive enough to detect the P-wave, which is the first wave that comes out of an earthquake and is typically much less damaging than the S-wave which comes afterward.” When your device senses something, it’ll send a message to Google’s earthquake detection server with some rough location information as to where it happened. The server will then gather data from other devices to corroborate and see if an earthquake is happening. UC Berkeley created an app in 2016 called MyShake that did something similar, and it appears Google has borrowed this idea, making it better integrated into the OS and more widespread.Subscribe to the Engadget Deals NewsletterGreat deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget’s editorial team.

The results of this work will for now be displayed when you look for “earthquake” or “earthquake near me” to show you if Android phones around you are reporting similar activity. Stogaitis added that the search results will also surface tips from “helpful, credible resources” on what to do after an earthquake. He also said the earthquake detection system, which he described as a “crowdsourced approach,” was developed with seismology and disaster experts Dr. Richard Allen, Dr. Qingkai Kong and Dr. Lucy Jones. Earthquake alerts are rolling out in California first, since there’s already a great seismometer-based system in place.” Stogaitis said the feature will roll out to more states and regions using the Android-based detection over the coming year. Google had more to share today. Along with updates to Android Auto and the smartphone OS, the company is adding a language option to its Emergency Location Service feature. This allows you to share your phone’s language setting when you’re dialing a local emergency number, which can enable a dispatcher to be better prepared with a translator ready, getting you help faster. If you find yourself in an emergency in a foreign land and don’t speak the local language, this could save some time in getting you the help you need.   - A weekly roundup of our favorite tech deals  - A daily dose of the news you need Please enter a valid email address Please select a newsletter By subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms and Privacy Policy."

Alaska Earthquake: Powerful Magnitude 7.8 Earthquake Hits Coastal Alaska,2020-07-22 04:00 UTC,https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2020/07/22/alaska-earthquake-powerful-magnitude-78-earthquake-hits-coastal-alaska/,"Alaska Earthquake that struck July 21, 2020. Late last night Alaska was struck with a magnitude 7.8 earthquake just off its coast, causing immediate concerns for tsunami risk.  The earthquake epicenter was located southeast off the coast of the Aleutian Island chain 65 miles from Perryville, Alaska. The earthquake’s hypocenter was 17 miles below the surface of the Earth, fairly shallow when it comes to earthquake depths. Shaking was felt across the peninsula as well as light shaking in Kodiak and Anchorage, 530 miles from the epicenter. Location of the earthquake epicenter.  The farther an earthquake originates offshore the more its waves dissipate before reaching land and thus damage is oftentimes dampened. However, one risk of offshore earthquakes is the potential for large tsunamis. A tsunami occurs when there is significant vertical offset of blocks during an earthquake. To mimic the scenario fill your bathtub up with water and place both hands side by side and flat underwater. Rapidly move one hand up and one hand down and you’ll notice you will create a wave. This is the motion that triggers an earthquake-related tsunami. However, when the earthquake motion is mostly side by side this can cause shaking but does not lead to a large tsunami. As residents of the peninsula went to high ground to protect themselves from a potential tsunami, they were in luck that the motion of this earthquake was largely horizontal and not vertical. Alaska witnesses regular and powerful earthquakes due to the subduction of the oceanic Pacific Plate underneath the continental North American Plate. This subduction between the two plates produces earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountains from Mexico to Alaska. "

'We're just having a bit of an earthquake here': New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern was unfazed when an earthquake hit during a live interview,2020-05-25 09:04 UTC,https://www.businessinsider.com/earthquake-interrupts-jacinda-ardern-in-live-interview-new-zealand-2020-5,"Jump to  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern appeared unflustered as she was interrupted by an earthquake during a live TV interview on Monday morning. Ardern was speaking with the morning news show ""The AM Show"" just before 8 a.m. when a 5.8 magnitude earthquake hit near the town of Levin. Almost 40,000 people felt the earthquake, The New Zealand Herald reported, and many rushed to reach cover. No major damage or fatalities have been reported. Ardern was giving the interview an hour away in Wellington, the country's capital, but seemed unflustered.  She added that Bridge shouldn't worry ""if you see things moving behind me,"" as the parliament building she was speaking from, called the Beehive, ""moves a little more than most.""  ""I'm not under any hanging lights. I look like I'm in a structurally strong place,"" she said.   A 5.8 magnitude earthquake can damage buildings that are not well constructed and is typically felt by everyone in the area. Typically only a few hundred earthquakes of this intensity take place a year. Ardern's cool response to the earthquake has won her praise, adding to her image as a seemingly unflappable leader. Many connected her collected response to the praise she had received for the way her country had handled the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand said in April that it had eliminated community spread of the virus.

 BOISE, Idaho — A large earthquake struck north of Boise on Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking.  The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Mont., and Salt Lake City, Utah. Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke’s Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn’t interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho’s coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation’s highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. “It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said. The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.”  Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it. “I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I’m sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.”  Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay. That quake was along what scientists call a “normal fault,” with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday’s quake appeared to be on an unmapped “strike-slip fault,” causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line. “This is one that wasn’t obvious enough to be mapped before now,” Jones said. Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they’re less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists. Residents in the region likely will continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake. “An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn’t surprise us,” she said. “They do every bit as much damage.”  People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said. “Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,” Jones said. “Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake. Just get down and try to cover.”

They gave no immediate details on the extent of other injuries. The earthquake struck amid a partial lockdown of the capital because of the spread of the coronavirus. People were told to avoid public areas, such as parks and public squares, but had little choice as they fled their residences. Up to five people are allowed to be together while keeping distance. Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said earthquake was the biggest in Zagreb in the last 140 years. A car is crushed by falling debris after an earthquake in Zagreb, Croatia, Sunday, March 22, 2020.

Steve Griffin, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — The coronavirus pandemic hasn’t shut down Salt Lake City’s golf courses yet, but Wednesday morning’s earthquake did. All of the five operating courses (Mountain Dell has not opened yet) were shut down for the day by the city following the early morning earthquake. That included Bonneville, Forest Dale, Nibley Park, Glendale and Rose Park.  Bonneville head pro Lynn Landgren said he was told to shut down the course, which only had a half dozen golfers out at the time, soon after the earthquake hit shortly after 7 a.m. The other courses apparently hadn’t opened for the day. He was told the shutdown was not related to the coronavirus crisis and he expected the golf courses to be running later this week.      Copyright © 2023 Deseret News Publishing Company.

Is a larger earthquake now imminent in Utah?,2020-03-18 16:40 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/3/18/21185295/earthquake-utah-magnitude-salt-lake-city-aftershock,"A firefighter arrives on scene where debris fell off of a building at 400 South and 500 West in Salt Lake City after a 5.7 magnitude earthquake centered in Magna hit early on Wednesday, March 18, 2020. Spenser Heaps, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — The earthquake that rattled the Salt Lake Valley and beyond Wednesday morning does not mean that a bigger one is on the way, a University of Utah seismologist said. Keith Koper, a U. geology and geophysics professor, said the 5.7 magnitude quake that hit the Wasatch Front was “moderate” in size, but considered big for Utah.  “It is not imminent that there is another large earthquake to come,” he said. “Do not expect a much larger earthquake. Do not expect a magnitude 7.” Koper said there is small — 4% to 5% — probability for a bigger earthquake to follow, but historically most earthquake sequences don’t unfold that way. The epicenter was north of Magna, between the city and Antelope Island near the edge of the Great Salt Lake, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. “We know it’s possible that there’s this few percent chance that it could happen and that’s just based on previous observations,” he said. “But the fact is, we can’t and we don’t predict earthquakes.” State agencies were also quelling speculation on social media that a magnitude 9.0 earthquake would hit the state because of Wednesday’s event. “Although it is possible that a larger earthquake in this area could be in the magnitude range of 7.0 to 7.5, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the chance of an earthquake of this size is about 1 in 300. Earthquakes of magnitude larger than 7.5 are unlikely to occur in Utah. A magnitude 9.0 earthquake is not possible in Utah,” according to the U. Health Department.   “The greater Magna area is probably not going to get to sleep a lot in the next few days because of this,” said Bob Carey, response and recovery bureau chief for the Utah Division of Emergency Management. Steven Bowman, Utah Geological Survey geologic hazards program manager, echoed Koper, saying, “As we go forward, we expect that we’re going to continue to have some of these smaller aftershocks.” Bowman said in addition to helping building inspectors, crews of geologists were out in the field checking for geological disruptions like landslides or liquefaction, a phenomenon that occurs after earthquakes where sand “boils” up from the ground. Bowman told reporters the damage was minimal.   “So far, we’ve only seen very small geologic evidence of damage,” he said at a news conference. “Some of these older buildings that are brick have had a lot more damage.” Koper described the quake as “relatively shallow,” with a depth of about 6 miles, and because of that it would be felt more strongly near the epicenter. Jess Anderson, Utah Department of Public Safety commissioner, said the earthquake was felt as far away as southern Idaho and Wyoming, across the Uinta Basin and into Millard County.  “We have every person that has always planned and prepared for this at the table and fully functional at this time,” Anderson said.    Sometimes the magnitude of an earthquake can change with more data, and the Magna quake could go up to 5.8 magnitude, Koper said. “It’s not going to get very much bigger than that,” he said. Still, having had at 5.7 magnitude earthquake doesn’t reduce the risk of having future earthquakes on the Wasatch Fault system. “This was not the big one. This is sort of a wake-up call,” Koper said, adding the state should maybe install an earthquake early warning system like the one that recently went live on the West Coast.   Carey said Utahns should use Wednesday’s “designer” earthquake as an opportunity to “calmly” review their family emergency preparedness plans.  “This is the earthquake I always wanted to have happen. I know that sounds nutty. But it puts us now to understand that we can actually have this. It’s not that we’ve been barking at the moon for all these years because it kind of feels like that,” he said. “And this is just a little one. Just think what our big one is going to look like.” Wednesday’s earthquake happened on the Wasatch Fault system, Koper said. The fault parallels the western base of the Wasatch Mountains for 220 miles from near Fayette, Sanpete County, in the south to near Malad, Idaho, in the north. Koper compared the fault to a tree trunk with many branches, and said the earthquake occurred a little west of the main fault line. “One of the reasons we’re having all these aftershocks is because of this main shock that happened. In general, these are all on the Wasatch Front system, so we’re not giving it a new name, a different name,” he said. Utah is built on an ancient lakebed. Part of the reason Wednesday’s shaking was relatively strong is that there’s a lot of sediment or weak rock in the basin, he said. “When you have an earthquake, the ground motion will get amplified. The energy in a sense will get trapped in the basin and it will act sort of like a bowl of jelly,” he said. That’s why people in tall buildings downtown felt significant swaying and shaking and people on the bench not as much, Koper said. Carey noted that some people in close proximity to each other had different experiences. One woman felt the shaking outside, but a man in the garage did not, he said. “People feel it different ways. The soil responds differently,” he said. Koper described the main 5.7 magnitude shock as a “normal faulting” earthquake, meaning the earth’s crust was stretched sideways. One side of the fault slipped downward on the other side of the fault, he said. “This is the type of earthquake that is very typical for this area,” he said. “It is different than the type of earthquakes that normally happen in California, which tend to be more strike-slip or the earthquakes that happen in Alaska, which tend to be crust earthquakes.” Koper said a magnitude 7.0 earthquake would release 1,000 times more energy than a magnitude 6.0. “It’s a totally differently animal, a magnitude 7 versus a magnitude 5.7. It would have been horrific if a magnitude 7 happened where this 5.7 happened this morning,” he said. “You wouldn’t be here. You wouldn’t be able to get here. That would be the difference. You would have significant infrastructure issues. Your biggest problem would be to try to figure out if whether your loved ones had made it out of that,” Carey told reporters at a news conference. “This is one that’s going to catch your attention, and I think we can use this to help better prepare ourselves, but it’s a walk in the park.”       Copyright © 2023 Deseret News Publishing Company.

Scott G Winterton, Deseret News A magnitude 5.7 earthquake just rattled parts of Utah, including Salt Lake City and areas across Salt Lake County and Utah County.  There were multiple aftershocks after the quake, ranging from 2.5 to 3.9 magnitude. According to Utah Emergency Management, this was the largest earthquake in Utah since 1992 when a 5.9 earthquake hit St. George.  “It didn’t feel like a small earthquake at all. I heard things in my kitchen falling,” said Michael McCarlie, who is in an apartment at City Creek Landing in Salt Lake City. At least two aftershocks were felt within 20 minutes of the original quake. Social media users said they felt the shock from Lehi, Bountiful, Herriman, Eagle Mountain, Park City and Salt Lake City, among others. One Twitter user reported feeling the quake in Idaho.

"Magnitude 7.7 earthquake strikes between Jamaica and Cuba, one of strongest on record in Caribbean",2020-01-28 21:02 UTC,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/01/28/earthquake-jamaica-cuba/,"This article was published more than 3 years ago One of the strongest earthquakes on record in the Caribbean, 7.7 magnitude, struck about 70 miles northwest of Montego Bay, Jamaica, shortly after 2 p.m. Tuesday. Minor shaking was felt as far north as Florida, while more moderate shaking was reported in Jamaica. Shaking was also reported in the Cayman Islands, Cuba. and Mexico. Initial reports of damage from the region have been spotty. In South Florida, where shaking was felt when the earthquake struck, multiple buildings were evacuated in Miami.  The originating earthquake appeared to be one of the biggest on record in the Caribbean, and the largest since 1946, with only a few additional high-end earthquakes appearing in the U.S. Geological Survey database. 7.0+ quakes in and around the Caribbean per USGS. For those in the Caribbean, the two in light blue were 7.7 like the prelim from today's in red.  #earthquake #jamaica #cuba pic.twitter.com/LaPB4N4xgE The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that a small tsunami was possible in parts of the Caribbean and surrounding areas, with  waves of up to three feet. However, just before 4 p.m., it posted that the tsunami threat had passed. Tide gauges indicated that any tsunami waves generated by the earthquake were small. Relatively small #tsunami wave arrival on tide gauge in Cayman Islands. Very fortunate for tsunami hazard that this is a strike-slip earthquake. pic.twitter.com/7LLoS12EBd A larger tsunami did not result as the earthquake was largely caused by a strike-slip mechanism with some obliquity. That means one tectonic plate probably slipped past another horizontally and downward. The M7.7 Jamaican quake produced sideways motion on the fault, so the tsunami risk is low. (Seafloor should move up to make tsunami.) But if I'm ever at the beach and feel strong shaking, I move to high ground. Downside is I lose a day at the beach. The upside could be my life. Converging plates, on the other hand, are usually the most effective at generating tsunamis. The magnitude of a tsunami is proportional to the area and magnitude of the slip. A look at background seismicity shows no recent foreshocks associated with this quake. Initially, it appears the quake occurred along the southern periphery of the North American plate, which is inching westward. At the same time, the Caribbean plate is moving northeast at several centimeters per year. Between them lies the Gonâve microplate. The earthquake occurred near the Cayman Trough. The energy release was equivalent to tens of billions of tons of explosives. The quake was exceptionally shallow, occurring at only a few miles’ depth. Because of its distance offshore, impacts may be minimized. Smaller aftershocks are likely in the region in the coming weeks. There are only 4-5 #earthquakes this strong on 🌎 every year #Jamaica #Cuba pic.twitter.com/sc0U2B14gr A “record section” produced by data from the Global Seismic Network, presented above, shows earthquake waves spreading out and traveling around the world. Each vertical trace represents an individual seismograph. When compiled together, they illustrate the waves propagating around the globe — detected by seismometers even if humans can’t feel them. (Time is measured from bottom to top.) Two distinct clusterings of waves can be seen in the plot. The first are body waves, which occur lower in each trace because they are the earliest waves to arrive following a quake. Body waves move through the earth. First are the P (compressional) waves, then the S (shear) waves — about 40 percent slower when traveling through solid rock. Surface waves are considerably slower, but they cause most damage. Surface waves are made up of Love waves, which result in a back-and-forth shaking, and Rayleigh waves, which cause a rolling motion. Surface waves are slower because they propagate along the earth’s surface. Ever heard folklore about animals “sensing” an earthquake before it arrives? That’s not myth. Some animals can sense the passage of ultra-subtle body waves (which we rarely feel) and take action, sometimes tens of minutes before the damaging surface waves arrive.

    Published Jan 16, 2020 4:00 PM EST
    

 Richard Aster is a Professor of Geophysics and Department Head, Colorado State University. This story originally featured on The Conversation Multiple strong and damaging earthquakes in southern Puerto Rico starting around Dec. 28, 2019 have killed at least one person, caused many serious injuries and collapsed numerous buildings, including a multistory school in the town of Guánica that luckily was empty at the time. These quakes are the most damaging to strike Puerto Rico since 1918, and the island has been under a state of emergency since Jan. 6, 2020. This flurry of quakes includes onshore and offshore events near the town of Indios and along Puerto Rico’s southwestern coast. So far it has included 11 foreshocks—smaller earthquakes that preceded the largest event, or mainshock—with magnitudes of 4 and greater. Major quakes occurred on Jan. 6 (magnitude 5.8) and Jan. 7 (magnitude 6.4 mainshock), followed by numerous large aftershocks. Seismologists like me are constantly working to better understand earthquakes, including advancing ways to help vulnerable communities before, during, and after damaging events. The physics of earthquakes are astoundingly complex, but our abilities to forecast future earthquakes during a strong sequence of events in real time is improving. Forecasting earthquakes is not a strict prediction—it’s more like a weather forecast, in which scientists estimate the likelihood of future earthquake activity based on quakes that have already occurred, using established statistical laws that govern earthquake behavior. Puerto Rico spans a complex boundary between the Caribbean and North American tectonic plates, which are sliding past each other in this region at a relative speed of about 2 centimeters per year. Over geologic time, this motion has created the Muertos Trough, a 15,000-foot depression in the sea floor south of the island. This plate boundary is riddled with interconnected fault structures. The present activity is occurring on and near at least three interrelated large faults. Faults are pre-existing weak zones between stronger rocks. In response to surprisingly small force (stress) changes, they rapidly slip to produce earthquakes. The “hair-trigger” nature of fault slip means that predicting the precise timing, location, and size of individual quakes is extremely challenging, if not impossible. During an earthquake sequence, changing stresses act on nearby fault systems as stress is gradually redistributed within the Earth. This process generates thousands of protracted aftershocks. Many earthquake sequences simply start with the mainshock. But it is not especially rare for scientists to recognize after the fact that foreshocks were occurring before the main event. Improvements in earthquake instrumentation and analysis are helping scientists detect foreshocks more often, although we have not yet figured out how to recognize them in real time. Researchers have known for over a century that the rate of earthquakes following a mainshock declines in a way that we can characterize statistically. There is also a well-established relationship between the magnitude of earthquakes and their relative number during an earthquake sequence. In most seismically active regions, for a decrease of one magnitude unit—say, from 4.0 to 3.0—people can expect to experience about 10 times as 3s compared to 4s in a given time period. Using such statistical relationships allows us to forecast the probability and sizes of future earthquakes while an earthquake sequence is underway. Put another way, if we are experiencing an aftershock sequence, we can project the future rate of earthquakes and what magnitudes we expect those quakes to have. For example, as of Jan. 14, the U.S. Geological Survey forecast estimated a 3 percent chance of one or more quakes larger than magnitude 6.4 in Puerto Rico over the next seven days. It also noted that the region should expect between 40 and 210 smaller quakes, with magnitude 3 or larger—sizes that are likely to be felt—during that time. With extended statistical modeling of earthquake sequences that include foreshock and aftershock probabilities, seismologists can forecast the likelihood of key earthquake scenarios to inform public safety efforts while earthquakes are occurring. For example, the USGS also estimated as of Jan. 13 that there was an 81 percent chance that the largest shock had already occurred—namely, the magnitude 6.4 quake on Jan. 7. The agency calculated a 17 percent chance that a closely sized “doublet” 6.4 earthquake could yet occur. Recognizing in real time when a set of earthquakes is likely to be a foreshock sequence is a challenging and active area of earthquake forecasting research. Progress in the effective forecasting and communication of ongoing earthquake hazards could mean the difference between life and death for people in the eastern Caribbean and other seismically active areas on an increasingly urbanized planet.

News 8’s Teresa Sardina spoke with a San Diego family currently living in Puerto Rico after the first earthquake struck and checked in with them after the latest quake.   The Merrill family raced out of their first-floor apartment in Ponce, Puerto Rico, Saturday morning after feeling the impact of the earthquake. It was the island's third big earthquake that rocked the southern coast in one week.   Samantha and Bryson Merrill said they are trying to stock up on much as they can.    A police escort was given to the Merrills's church group which was assisting Guanica, the town that has been hit the hardest, providing care packages and supplies for those who are not in their homes.  A third of the island is still without power and the American Red Cross has come in to help. The local headquarters for the agency says there has been a spike of interest for earthquake preparedness.     The quakes are a reminder of how our community needs to prepare for an emergency whether it's a wildfire of earthquake and to be ready at home or at any time.  Samantha said, being from San Diego, she thinks about what it would be like if we had a big earthquake.    ""You never know when a disaster is going to strike you need to be prepared and don't put it off,” she said.   Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings."

Puerto Rico earthquake: Roughly two-thirds of island without power amid dozens of aftershocks,2020-01-09 03:18 UTC,https://kfor.com/2020/01/08/puerto-rico-earthquake-roughly-two-thirds-of-island-without-power-amid-dozens-of-aftershocks/,"KFOR.com Oklahoma City Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.     PUERTO RICO (CNN) — Roughly two-thirds of Puerto Rico remains without electricity, many still don’t have water and frightened residents were staying outside as a series of aftershocks rocked the island following a magnitude 6.4 earthquake. The quake was the strongest and likely the most damaging of hundreds of temblors that have struck the island since December 28. It hit before dawn Tuesday, leaving a man dead and causing dozens of homes and structures to crumble. It was centered off Puerto Rico’s southern coast, 6 miles south of Indios. Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with residents to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks. Terrified of sleeping indoors as aftershocks continue, neighbors put mattresses in their front yards while others spent the night Tuesday under white tents and tarps. Noelia de Jesus has been sleeping at an outdoors shelter with her granddaughters, terrified of returning to her Guanica home. “I’ve been crying ever since it happened,” de Jesus told CNN. “Everything is broken…the house is leaning to the right. If another (earthquake) comes, it’s going to go down.” It’s the third time that a natural disaster leaves her without a place to live. Like her, many Puerto Ricans lost their homes when Hurricane Maria hit the island two years ago and Hurricane George struck in 1998. Guanica Mayor Santos Seda said about 50 homes were destroyed by the earthquake and at least 100 more were “about to collapse” on Wednesday. Hundreds of aftershocks have hit the area in the past few days. As of Wednesday afternoon, the island in just 24 hours had experienced about 50 seismic events of magnitude 2.5 or higher, the US Geological Survey said. A 4.7 earthquake was reported Wednesday afternoon off the southern coast of the island, about 8 miles southeast of Tallaboa, USGS said. The National Weather Service office in San Juan said there was no tsunami threat.  “With the hurricane, you knew when and at what time it would arrive,” Guayanilla resident Tatiana Rodriguez, 28, said, adding of the quakes, “This, you don’t know at what time it’s going to happen.” The town of 18,000 located near the southern coast hasn’t been getting regular updates, she said. Residents are disinclined to leave their homes because they don’t know what areas are safe. Rodriguez worries that recovery will be difficult, especially for those hit hard by Maria, she said. “There are a lot of people that started from zero because of Maria,” she said. “(They’re) starting again from zero.” Ashley Ramirez Perez, 22, hasn’t seen her partner since Saturday. He was receiving treatment at a clinic in Guanica, about 12 miles west of Guayanilla, but patients were moved after the quakes and she doesn’t know where he is. She doesn’t think he knows where she is, either, she said. Perez and her relatives, including her 58-year-old father, took shelter at Gloria Maria Borrero School in Guayanilla after Perez’s apartment began “separating from the sidewalk,” she said. She’s been without power for two days, and the balcony of her apartment is “a bit toppled” as well, she told CNN on Tuesday. “I never thought a quake would destroy so much,” she said. “Hurricane Maria was nothing compared to this.”  A system-wide power outage was reported after the Costa Sur power plant near Guayanilla suffered severe damage Tuesday, Vázquez Garced said. “We lost the largest plant in the entire system,” said Jose Ortiz, executive director of the Electric Power Authority. Power has been restored in most hospitals, and crews are working to fully restore it by the weekend, Ortiz said. A nursing home in Ponce was evacuated and dozens of people in wheelchairs were waiting outside. Guanica experienced at least 10 aftershocks Wednesday before 8 a.m. (7 a.m. ET), Mayor Seda said. More than 200 people took shelter at a Guanica coliseum, he said, but fearful for their safety if the building were toppled, they relocated to the parking lot. “So much worse than Maria, because a hurricane, we can tell where the hurricane is coming through, but we don’t with an earthquake,” Seda told CNN. “Yesterday, my wife and I slept on the sidewalk right outside my house, and we saw the same thing everywhere.”  The Agripina Seda School in Guanica suffered major damage Tuesday, including a partially collapsed, three-story building. “Classes in the public school system won’t resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,” Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won’t return to the schools until further notice.  “There’s no warnings for this,” Puerto Rico Police Commissioner Henry Escalera said of the earthquakes. “A hurricane gives us time to plan ahead.” When asked what concerns him the most about the quakes’ aftermath, he said, “That homes will not be safe to live in and the possibility of a collapse that will cause a person’s death or serious injuries.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced aid has been made available to supplement local response efforts. President Donald Trump’s action authorizes FEMA to coordinate all disaster relief efforts and provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures to save lives and protect property.

"Punta Ventana, one of Puerto Rico's natural wonders, has been destroyed by an earthquake",2020-01-07 17:25 UTC,https://kfor.com/2020/01/07/punta-ventana-one-of-puerto-ricos-natural-wonders-has-been-destroyed-by-an-earthquake/,"KFOR.com Oklahoma City Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.     (CNN) — A famous tourist landmark and one of Puerto Rico’s most cherished natural wonders collapsed on Monday after an earthquake shook the island, Nelson Torres Yordan, the mayor of Guaynilla, confirmed. Punta Ventana, which translates to “Window Point,” was a stone arch shaped like a round window located in Guayanilla along the southern coast. The rock formation was one of the island’s most iconic treasures and major tourist attractions. A 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck the island on Monday, wiping out the natural structure. The UPRM Meteorological Laboratory shared a photo on Twitter of Punta Ventana before and after the earthquake, showing where the soaring arch once stood before its tragic collapse. “The natural window disappears in Punta Ventana, Guayanilla,” UPRM said. A colonial church constructed in 1841 also “totally collapsed,” during the earthquake, according to Yordan. Another earthquake, this one measuring 6.4, and several other strong tremors struck Puerto Rico on Tuesday, killing at least one man and injuring several others. Tuesday’s quake — the strongest and most damaging of a series of quakes that have hit the island since December 28 — moved Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced to declare a state of emergency, activating the Puerto Rico National Guard. It’s likely the most damaging quake to impact the island since 1918.

A powerful earthquake sent shockwaves through Croatia on Tuesday, causing major damage to a town south of the country's capital, Zagreb, and killing at least six, according to news reports quoting officials and residents.  ""This is the largest earthquake to occur in Croatia since the advent of modern seismic instrumentation,"" according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A slightly smaller earthquake shook Zagreb in 1880. Tuesday's tremors hit Petrinja the hardest. The central Croatian town has a population of around 24,000. Buildings collapsed. Debris filled the streets. A woman was trapped under rubble, according to government-owned news website HINA.

At least 20 people were hospitalized with injuries, two with serious ones, they said. “The center of Petrinja as it used to be no longer exists,” Croatria’s state HRT television said in its report. “One girl died and there are injuries and people inside collapsed buildings.” “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT TV. “This is like Hiroshima – half of the city no longer exists.” “The city has been demolished, the city is no longer livable,” he said. “We need help.” Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake. “They are searching through the rubble to see if there is anyone else there,” Plenkovic said. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable.” He said the army has 500 places ready in barracks to house people, while others will be accommodated in nearby hotels and other available places. “No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” the prime minister said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that she spoke with Plenkovic and instructed an envoy to travel to Croatia as soon as possible. As a Mediterranean country, Croatia is prone to earthquakes, but not big ones. The last strong quake struck in the 1990’s when the picturesque Adriatic coast village of Ston was destroyed. Regional TV channel N1 reported live Tuesday from Petrinja that a collapsed building had fallen on a car. The footage showed firefighters trying to remove the debris to reach the car, which was buried underneath. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the car and carried into an ambulance. Fallen bricks and dust littered the streets, and many houses were completely destroyed. The Croatian military was deployed in Petrinja to help with the rescue operation. Croatian seismologist Kresimir Kuk described the earthquake as “extremely strong,” far stronger than another one that hit Zagreb and nearby areas in the spring. He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky, old buildings and to move to the newer areas of the city because of the aftershocks. In the capital, people ran out into the streets and parks in fear. Many reportedly were leaving Zagreb, ignoring a travel ban imposed because of the coronavirus outbreak. The earthquake was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia and Slovenia. It even was felt as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported. Authorities in Slovenia said the Krsko nuclear power plant was temporarily shut down following the earthquake. The power plant is jointly owned by Slovenia and Croatia and located near their border.

Magnitude 6.3 earthquake hits Croatia; 1 death reported,2020-12-29 13:23 UTC,https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/12/29/magnitude-6-3-earthquake-hits-croatia-1-death-reported/,"E-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters E-Edition  By SASA KAVIC PETRINJA, Croatia (AP) — A strong earthquake in Croatia destroyed buildings and killed at least seven people Tuesday southwest of the capital, displacing scores of area residents or making them afraid to sleep indoors as emergency teams searched for those still missing by nightfall.  Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. Another six people were killed in nearly destroyed villages close to the town, according to HRT state television. At least 26 people were hospitalized, six with serious injuries, officials said, adding that many more people remained unaccounted for. In Petrinja, cries could be heard from underneath destroyed houses. One woman was found alive some four hours after the quake. Emergency teams used rescue dogs in the search for survivors, while family members looked on in despair. “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT. “This is like Hiroshima – half of the city no longer exists.” Firefighters worked to remove the debris from a collapsed building that fell on a car. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the vehicle and carried into an ambulance. The town was left without electricity or running water as officials scrambled to set up temporary accommodation for all of the displaced residents in need. Residents fearing another earthquake seemed poised to spend the night outside their homes. Petrinja resident Marica Pavlovic said the quake felt “worse than a war.” “It was horrible, a shock. You don’t know what to do, whether to run out or hide somewhere,” she told The Associated Press. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable,” Plenkovic said. He said the army has 500 places ready in barracks to house people, while others will be accommodated in nearby hotels and other places. “No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” the prime minister said. Officials also toured a damaged hospital in the nearby town of Sisak, which was also badly hit. Plenkovic said the patients will be evacuated in army helicopters and ambulances. Health officials said a baby was delivered in a tent in front of the hospital in the aftermath of the earthquake. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that she spoke with Plenkovic and instructed an envoy to travel to Croatia as soon as possible. As a Mediterranean country, Croatia is prone to earthquakes, but not big ones. The last strong quake struck in the 1990s when the picturesque Adriatic coast village of Ston was destroyed.

ShakeAlertLA to be replaced by statewide earthquake early-warning app,2020-12-23 23:41 UTC,https://www.foxla.com/news/shakealertla-to-be-replaced-by-statewide-earthquake-early-warning-app,"Share  LOS ANGELES - The city's ShakeAlertLA app will stop issuing earthquake warnings after Dec. 31, and Mayor Eric Garcetti urged residents to download the statewide MyShake app that was built with the same technology and provides the same alerts. ShakeAlertLA was designed to notify residents when earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher occur.  ""Los Angeles leads the nation in earthquake resilience, and ShakeAlertLA showed how we can harness technology to provide critical warning before an earthquake hits,'' Garcetti said in a statement. ""The next `big one' is not a matter of if, but when, and we can all do our part to stay prepared, resilient and a few seconds ahead of the game by downloading the MyShake app now.'' Gov. Gavin Newsom announced MyShake on Oct. 17, 2019, and since its release it has been downloaded more than 1 million times, according to the mayor's office. ""Through working cooperatively with the U.S. Geological Survey, the city of Los Angeles delivered the country's first cell phone app for mass delivery of earthquake early warning alerts,"" U.S. Geological Survey Director Jim Reilly said. ""What we learned from our important pilot partnership with the city of L.A. has benefited people throughout the West Coast as we expand ShakeAlert.'' The MyShake system works the same way as ShakeAlertLA and detects earthquakes through ground-motion censors. If an earthquake with a significantmagnitude is detected, an alert message is issued, warning the public several seconds before shaking begins. ShakeAlertLA issued 100,000 early warning alerts of all recordable earthquake activity since its launch in 2018, according to the mayor's office.  ""On behalf of the governor and state of California, we thank Mayor Garcetti for his leadership and work to advance seismic safety,'' said Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services. ""We are better positioned today because of the mayor's efforts and encourage all Angelenos to access the statewide earthquake early warning system, which can provide life-saving seconds to drop, cover and hold on before an earthquake. We are pleased to be able to expand this life-saving technology to all Californians.'' ShakeAlertLA was meant to ""serve as a bridge'' to a statewide earthquake early warning system, according to the mayor's office, and city officials worked with other governments to assist them in developing earthquake early warning programs. Now that a statewide system is in place, the ShakeAlertLA app will stop sending alerts at the start of 2021. The MyShake app is available for download through the Apple Store or Google Play.

Several buildings were wrecked in Turkey’s western Izmir province, according to officials, but there was no immediate information on casualties. ISTANBUL — A strong earthquake struck Friday between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, collapsing several buildings in Turkey’s western Izmir province and leaving at least four people dead. Dozens more were injured, while some damage to buildings and the road network, and four light injuries were also reported on Samos. Turkey’s Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted that four people were killed in Izmir and 120 were injured. He said 38 ambulances, two ambulance helicopters and 35 medical rescue teams were working in Izmir. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 with an epicenter 13 kilometers (8 miles) north northeast of the Greek island of Samos.

Greek media said the residents of Samos and other islands fled their homes, while some rockfalls were reported. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Turkey and Greece reported aftershocks. The quake was also felt in Bulgaria. Greek seismologist Efthymios Lekkas told Greek state television ERT that it was still too early to say whether this was the main earthquake, although he said it was likely it was. “It is an event that is evolving,” Lekkas said, adding that some damage had been reported in parts of Samos. A tsunami warning was issued, with residents of the Samos area told to stay away from the coastline. Water rose above the dock in the main harbor of Samos and flooded the street. The regional governor of the Samos region, Yiannis Stamoulis, said no injuries had been reported on the island. Residents have also been told to stay away from buildings, as aftershocks continued to rattle the area.

"3.1 magnitude earthquake hits central NJ, felt as far away as NYC",2020-09-09 10:46 UTC,https://1010wins.radio.com/articles/31-magnitude-earthquake-hits-central-new-jersey,"EAST FREEHOLD (1010 WINS) – A magnitude 3.1 earthquake struck New Jersey on Wednesday morning, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake hit about 1.25 miles southeast of East Freehold a little after 2 a.m. It was about 3 miles deep. It “was felt in much of central New Jersey,” according to the National Weather Service.   No injuries or major damage have been reported. The earthquake was also felt as far away as New York City, Long Island and Philadelphia.   “The house shook very briefly, we thought a large tree might’ve fallen in our backyard but realized it was an earthquake,” a resident of Monroe Township wrote. A resident of Philadelphia said, “It lasted about 10 seconds. My bedroom door started shaking and woke me up.” Robert Sanders, a geophysicist with the survey, told the Associated Press, “It would be very surprising for us to see anything more than you know, damaged shelves or picture frames falling off of windows.” “That's a fairly uncommon event magnitude for quakes in this area,” Robert Sanders, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told the Associated Press. Since 1970, there have been two other quakes within 10 miles of this location, a 3.5 in 1979 and a 3.1 in 1992, he said."

Open source takes on earthquake early warning project,2020-08-13 19:34 UTC,https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-takes-on-earthquake-early-warning-project/,"Most Popular I think the world's trying to tell me something. As I got ready to write this story about The Linux Foundation hosting Grillo's open-source OpenEEW earthquake early warning system, I was hit by North Carolina's worst earthquake in over a century. Of course, a 5.1 magnitude earthquake would barely merit a story in California, but here it was big news. And, frankly, any system that can help warn people about earthquakes is a good thing.  While my little earthquake did no real damage, they can kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of infrastructure. Any early warning can save lives which is why countries like Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have national earthquake early-warning systems (EWW)s.  Earthquakes often hit developing countries the worst due in part to their poor construction and infrastructure. 2010's Haiti earthquake, for instance, killed more than 200,000 people and caused over 10 billion dollars of damage.  Google's early warning system uses Android phones' built-in accelerometers to detect earthquakes. It then alerts Google's earthquake detection server, which coordinates the data to find the tremor's epicenter. It then sends out alerts.  The Grillo OpenEEW sensors consist of a high-performance Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometer, a network connector, a loud buzzer, and 3 bright Neopixel LEDS. It has already proven to be as good as seismometers that cost 60x more. For example, the OpenEEW system caught the recent 4.8 Puerto Rico earthquake as it happened.   There are two important differences between Grillo's sensors and the ones in smartphones. Grillo's founder Andres Meira explained that while the phone approach would work well in urban areas, ""Google's smartphone solution doesn't work well in seismic regions where earthquakes happen in sparsely populated areas (New Zealand, Nepal, etc). There you need fixed stations."" In addition, ""The OpenEEW sensors feature higher quality accelerometers and so are more suitable for researchers or other applications."" The OpenEEW sensors have already been deployed since 2017 in Mexico, Chile, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica. Grillo sensors have already generated more than 1TB of data.  IBM, an OpenEEW founding member, is deploying more sensors in Puerto Rico. These work together using an IBM cloud-hosted Node-Red dashboard. IBM is also creating a Docker containerized version of the detection component, which can be deployed to Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift on the IBM Cloud.  The project's point, besides helping to save lives, is to encourage makers, data scientists, entrepreneurs, and seismologists to build EEWs in places like Nepal, New Zealand, Ecuador, and other remote regions prone to earthquakes. OpenEEW also hopes open-source developers and engineers can help advance sensor hardware design; improve earthquake detection and characterization through machine learning, and create new methods for delivering alerts to people. Both Google and OpenEEW's projects will help make earthquakes more survivable for everyone. That's one goal we can all agree on. "

"Earthquake: 3.1 quake near Brawley, Calif.",2020-08-10 14:06 UTC,https://news.yahoo.com/earthquake-3-1-quake-near-140621012.html,"A swarm of mostly small earthquakes on Monday struck the Salton Sea area, one of the most seismically active areas of California.  More than a dozen temblors followed, one measuring 4.0 and several in the 3 range. Quake swarms are fairly common in this region, with some producing more than 1,000 small temblors. Scientists are carefully monitoring the series of quakes, as they are centered at the southern tip of the dangerous San Andreas fault. There is concern the swarm could trigger a larger event, a phenomenon that has occurred in that region in the past. Neil Driscoll, a geophysicist at UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, pointed to a chain reaction that occurred in November 1987 when a 6.2 quake on the Elmore Ranch fault near the Salton Sea triggered a 6.6 temblor just over 11 hours later on the Superstition Hills fault. Both quakes were widely felt in San Diego County. “We have had many swarms in that area over the years, and there has been no triggering of a fault, but we’re watching this closely,” said Driscoll. “We can’t say whether it is or isn’t going to trigger a larger earthquake.” Did you feel these earthquake?

In Sparta, North Carolina, it left a significant amount of damage downtown, with bricks falling off several buildings. “We had gotten woken up by a boom a little after two and couldn’t go back to sleep,” said Jacob Church, a Sparta resident. “At first it was like, ‘What’s going on?’ None of us were injured. I think it’s a cool thing to be a part of that,” said Brandon Lineberry, who was visiting at the time. The quake rattled a cemetery so hard, it uprooted headstones from the ground. Just a few miles from downtown, the North Carolina Department of Transportation was dealing with the damage to a water main. “We’re just trying to get it back open. It’s buckled up the road a little from the water main, from the earthquake, and we’re just trying to get it back to normal,” said Jeffery Jones, with the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The damage was significant at Scott’s Landscaping Nursery and Farms, leaving several cracks in the parking lot and shattering pottery. “It’s been a rough morning. You don’t expect anything like this to happen here because it doesn’t happen here,” said owner Scott Smith, adding that “2020 has been a rough year for a lot of people.” The mayor of Sparta, Wes Brinegar, issued a state of emergency Sunday after the earthquake hit. No injuries had been reported.  The mayor said Sunday there was widespread minor damage to homes, with structures and chimneys being knocked off.  Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

Did your pet seem to 'know' the earthquake was coming?,2020-08-09 19:57 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/09/did-your-pet-seem-know-earthquake-was-coming/,"(WBTV) - Did your pet act strangely before the Earth started shaking during this morning’s earthquake? Stefanie Scism asked WBTV anchor Maureen O’Boyle in an email, “Did anyone else report their dogs acting crazy this morning BEFORE the shaking?” For centuries, people have shared observations just like Scism’s, according to the United States Geological Survey, with people recalling the moments before an earthquake when animals exhibited bizarre behavior. This is what Scism says happened to her Sunday morning. “I have 3 dogs and the only reason I was up is they were trying to climb on me,” she said. “They NEVER do that.” We’ll get to what seismologists say about this in a moment. But it turns out Scism’s experience this morning was not unique. Soon after the earthquake, WBTV First Alert Meteorologist Leigh Brock was on Facebook Live explaining to viewers what they had just experienced. It was a 5.1 magnitude earthquake, the epicenter in Sparta, North Carolina. As Brock was sharing her knowledge, viewers started sharing their experiences. Some talked specifically about their pets. “There wasn’t a lot of talk at that point of damage,” Brock said. “But a lot of viewers were saying their dogs were barking and running around and acting strange."" After experiencing something similar in California in the mid-90′s during an earthquake, O’Boyle wanted to believe her dog “knew” the earthquake was coming. O’Boyle remembers it like it was yesterday. She was living in a home in the hills above West Hollywood. Her three-year-old mutt Sammy started arching his back and lifting his paws like the ground was suddenly hot. That was immediately followed by deep howling sound. It was bizarre, to say the least. Then, boom. O’Boyle’s house didn’t shake. She described it more as a giant “thud,” as if the house was a boat making a sudden bump into the dock. O’Boyle wanted to believe her dog was trying to “warn” her of what was coming. But our pets will never cause seismologists to lose their jobs.  “We can easily explain the cause of unusual animal behavior seconds before humans feel an earthquake,” according to an article on the USGS web site. “Very few humans notice the smaller P wave that travels the fastest from the earthquake source and arrives before the larger S wave. But many animals with more keen senses are able to feel the P wave seconds before the S wave arrives. As for sensing an impending earthquake days or weeks before it occurs, that’s a different story,” the article explains,” the article continued. So yes, there is something to it. That “P wave” may be why your dog, like all three of Scism’s did things they never do moments before the Earth started to move. It would be wonderful if animals could “warn” us when an earthquake is coming, but we would need more than seconds. The USGS writes, “However, consistent and reliable behavior prior to seismic events, and a mechanism explaining how it could work, still eludes us.” Copyright 2020 WBTV. All rights reserved."
"Residents Rocked, House Walls Buckle as Powerful Earthquake Rocks North Carolina",2020-08-09 19:15 UTC,https://www.westernjournal.com/residents-rocked-house-walls-buckle-powerful-earthquake-rocks-north-carolina/,"A 5.1 magnitude earthquake rocked North Carolina Sunday after a chain of smaller quakes had jolted parts of the state late Saturday and early Sunday.  “The information center received more than 6,000 reports of the earthquake in a 200-mile radius that touches seven states,” he said. The quake was the strongest to hit North Carolina since a 1916 earthquake that registered 5.2 on the scale, the News & Observer reported. Immediate reports of damage included cracks in pavement, facades on homes losing bricks or stones, or items falling from store shelves. No immediate reports of injuries were received. ”You knew right away it was an earthquake. There was no question about it,” said Shari Carricker, according to the Charlotte Observer. “We have no damage, except the coffee in my husband’s coffee cup sloshed out,” she said. “But it was scary.

Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. (AP/WGHP) — The most powerful earthquake to hit North Carolina in more than 100 years shook much of the state early Sunday, rattling homes, businesses and residents.  There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Michael Hull was standing in his driveway at his home in Sparta when he noticed a group of deer running. “Not even a minute passed and the side-to-side motion started,” Hull said. “It takes you a minute to realize what’s happening, and you just can’t believe it. Then it was over. It was loud, like God was shaking a mountain at you, literally.”  Karen Backer was in her Greensboro apartment when she heard initially mistook banging in her kitchen for her roommate. “Nope, it was the cabinet doors ‘clinking’ open and closed! My neighbors on the other hand said they felt our apartment building shaking,” Backer said. “Well, sadly, nothing surprises me in 2020, but a hurricane and an earthquake in the same week is crazy.” It was the largest earthquake to hit the state since 1916, when a magnitude 5.5 quake occurred near Skyland, the weather service said. The U.S. Geological Service said the quake’s epicenter was about 2.5 miles (four kilometers) southeast of Sparta, just south of the Virginia-North Carolina border. The USGS said the population in the affected region resides in structures “that are resistant to earthquake shaking, though vulnerable structures exist.”  The quake was felt in nearby states including Virginia, South Carolina and Tennessee. Many who felt the earthquake said it last 10-15 seconds. A viewer in Pfafftown told us, “Around 8 a.m. this morning, our bedroom shook. We thought a tree had fallen, but then heard it was an earthquake.” By far the largest quake in North Carolina since a M 5.2 in 1916. #Earthquake pic.twitter.com/J3yuTrdSq5  Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

"5.1 Magnitude Earthquake Reported in North Carolina, With Effects Felt Across Multiple States",2020-08-09 14:58 UTC,https://time.com/5877852/north-carolina-earthquake/,"A shallow 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck Sunday morning about 2.5 miles southeast of Sparta, N.C., close to the state’s border with Virginia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The earthquake’s effects were reportedly experienced throughout parts of North Carolina as well as in neighboring states in the Southeast. Residents of Raleigh, N.C., Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee indicated they felt tremors, too.  The USGS identifies the largest earthquake in North Carolina—also of magnitude 5.1—occurred in 1916. The inland Carolinas deal with “moderately damaging earthquakes… every few decades and “smaller earthquakes are felt about once each year or two,” the agency says. Aftershocks are likely in the coming week. The USGS says that people should “be ready for more earthquakes than usual” as aftershocks “will continue to occur near the mainshock.” In the days leading up to Aug. 16, the agency estimates that the chance of “an earthquake of magnitude 3 or higher is 57%” with as many as 57 occurring. Stronger earthquakes are significantly less likely, the agency says. It suggests that “the chance of an earthquake of magnitude 5 or higher is 5%” and “the chance of an earthquake of magnitude 7 or higher is 1 in 2,000.” The South Carolina Emergency Management Division said in a tweet Sunday morning that it had received “multiple calls about a possible earthquake in the state.” It stated that “no earthquake has been confirmed” in South Carolina but that it’s possible these are effects from the earthquake reported in North Carolina.

"In 1981, scientists predicted an earthquake like the one that rattled the Alaska Peninsula this week",2020-07-25 19:49 UTC,https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/science/2020/07/25/in-1981-scientists-predicted-an-earthquake-like-the-one-that-rattled-the-alaska-peninsula-this-week/,"Late Tuesday, state seismologist Michael West heard a text alarm. His phone informed him of a large earthquake beneath the ocean, just south of the Alaska Peninsula, about 60 miles southeast of the village of Sand Point. His first thought was that this — the biggest earthquake on the planet so far in 2020 — would cause a devastating tsunami. His second thought was that a longstanding earthquake mystery may have just been solved.  West and his colleagues at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute were still awash in data one day after the event. But he was quick to point out a scientific paper written by the first Alaska state seismologist, John Davies, in 1981. All the large recent earthquakes on the Aleutian Subduction Zone, including the magnitude 7.8 in the “Shumagin Gap” that occurred July 21, 2020. (Graphic courtesy Alaska Earthquake Center)  In it, Davies and his co-workers proposed a “seismic gap” just south of Sand Point. There, they wrote, was a swath of one of the world’s great subduction zones that had not ruptured in a long time. It was perhaps due. Davies made his prediction after field campaigns in the 1970s, during which he and his co-workers had installed seismometers near Popof Island, upon which the village of Sand Point (population 1,140) sits. “From 1938 to 1965, almost the entirety of the Alaska subduction zone ruptured,” West said. “There were only two places that didn’t rip — one in the Yakutat area and another in the Shumagin Islands (where the July 21 earthquake occurred). “Here, you have this 1981 paper that says you’ve ruptured everything except these sections, and that’s where you should expect the next big earthquake.” [Alaska quake that prompted tsunami evacuations, but no big wave, may offer clue in scientific debate]  “The Pacific Plate is careening northwestward a couple of inches each year into the stronger North American Plate,” he said. “This forces the Pacific Plate to thrust down under Alaska. Major earthquakes happen at the boundary where these two plates rub together.” John Davies, who wrote the paper predicting an earthquake like the one that happened Tuesday night, was elected to the Alaska State Legislature in 1993. He then had to resign from his position at the Geophysical Institute, where, like West, he was the state seismologist. Davies’ doctorate work, executed in Skwentna, Alaska, helped prove the newish theory of plate tectonics, in which scientists like his mentor David Stone had argued that Earth’s crust is composed of colossal blocks shoving into one another. Davies showed that the Pacific Plate was indeed diving deep beneath Anchorage, and reached almost to Denali. After turning to politics, Davis never went back to seismology. The day after the 2020 earthquake, he and his wife, Linda Schandelmeier, were making kimchi from Napa cabbage they had harvested from their garden in Fairbanks. Reached by phone, Davies said he was happy to hear that his research of decades ago was suddenly relevant. “That would be really gratifying if that turned out to be true,” Davies said. West said the shadow of aftershocks from the earthquake were enough for him to believe that a significant portion of the Shumagin Gap had ruptured, and was perhaps not just some quirky section that slips quietly without major earthquakes. Davies, who as state seismologist had a duty to find the areas of greatest earthquake risk and advise about building codes and warn of tsunami hazards, said large earthquakes somewhat remind him of current times. “Earthquakes are like viruses — the really big ones come along once in a lifetime, if at all,” he said. “We have these hazards that occur with such a long time between them. It’s hard to get people to pay attention.” [Because of a high volume of comments requiring moderation, we are temporarily disabling comments on many of our articles so editors can focus on the coronavirus crisis and other coverage.

Powerful magnitude 7.8 earthquake strikes off of Alaska,2020-07-22 13:07 UTC,https://www.foxla.com/news/powerful-magnitude-7-8-earthquake-strikes-off-of-alaska,"Share  ANCHORAGE, Alaska - A powerful earthquake struck off of Alaska's southern coast jolted some coastal communities late Tuesday, and some residents briefly scrambled for higher ground over fears of a tsunami. There were no immediate reports of damage in the sparsely populated area of the state, and a tsunami warning was canceled after the magnitude 7.8 quake off the Alaska Peninsula produced a wave of less than a foot.  Because of its location, nearby communities along the Alaska Peninsula did not experience shaking that would normally be associated with that magnitude of a quake, said Michael West, Alaska State Seismologist. Get breaking news alerts in the FOX5NY News app. It is FREE! Download for iOS or Android  “No reports of any damage,” Kodiak Police Sgt. Mike Sorter told The Associated Press early Wednesday morning. “No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal.” Kodiak is about 200 miles northeast of where the earthquake was centered. The tsunami warning had coastal residents evacuating for higher ground. Social media posts showed long lines of people fleeing towns like Homer and Kodiak while tsunami sirens wailed in the background. On Kodiak Island, the local high school opened its doors for evacuees, as did the local Catholic school, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “We’ve got a high school full of people,” said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. “I’ve been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,” he told the Daily News. “Everything’s as calm as can be. We’ve got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,” he said before the warning was canceled. Tsunami warnings are commonplace for people who grew up in Kodiak. ”I’ve been doing these since I was a little kid,” LeDoux told the newspaper. “Old news.” Officials at the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, began calling off tsunami advisories and warnings after a wave of only 25 centimeters (.8 foot) was recorded in the community of Sand Point. “I might have expected a little bit more water, but I’m happy that there wasn’t,” said David Hale, the senior duty scientist at the tsunami center. Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that caused damage in the Anchorage area in November 2018. “This earthquake released about 15 times as much energy as that earthquake, said West, the state seismologist. More than a dozen aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or higher were reported immediately after the earthquake, he said by telephone from the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ”We got people here who are going be working all night,” West said early Wednesday morning. ”These aftershocks will go and go and go and go.” The Alaska-Aleutian Trench was also where a magnitude 9.2 quake in 1964 was centered. That remains the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded. The temblor and ensuing tsunami caused widespread damage and killed 131 people, some as far away as Oregon and California. Alaska is the most actively seismic state. Nearly 25,000 earthquakes have been recorded in Alaska since Jan. 1, according to the center.

Study suggests risk of big San Andreas earthquake has increased,2020-07-14 07:00 UTC,https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/study-suggests-risk-of-big-san-andreas-earthquake-has-increased/509-2e476964-c129-4ddd-8537-3e9a35f34553,"CALIFORNIA, USA — The Ridgecrest earthquakes in 2019 may have upped the chances of a quake along the San Andreas fault with magnitude 7.5 or greater in the next 12 months, according to a study published Monday in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America.The Los Angeles Times reported on the findings that there is a 2.3% chance of a large earthquake on the Garlock fault, which runs along the north edge of the Mojave Desert, in the next year. That increases the likelihood of a big shake-up on the larger San Andreas fault to 1.15%.Those low probabilities may seem hardly worth worrying about given more pressing concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the numbers translate into a near tripling of the odds of a large quake on the San Andreas, one of the study's co-authors told The Times.Ross Stein, an earthquake scientist emeritus of the U.S. Geological Survey and adjunct professor of geophysics at Stanford University told the newspaper that if the Garlock fault ruptures, the probability of a big earthquake along the San Andreas fault could be even odds.""Now, you can think of the Ridgecrest earthquake as being so far from Greater Los Angeles ... that it is nearly harmless,"" Stein told The Times.""But the problem is that ... the Ridgecrest earthquake brought the Garlock fault closer to rupture. If that fault ruptures -- and it gets within about 25 miles of the San Andreas -- then there's a high likelihood, maybe a 50/50 shot, that it would immediately rupture on the San Andreas.""A hypothetical magnitude 7.8 quake on the San Andreas could cause more than 1,800 deaths, injure 5,000, displace 500,000 to 1 million people from their homes and cripple the region economically for a generation, The Times reported.A quake of that magnitude would produce 45 times more energy than the 1994 magnitude 6.7 Northridge quake.Another seismologist, not involved in the study, said its conclusions are not confirmed.""It's really interesting science, and I like the way they've been able to increase the complexity of how they do their modeling,"" Lucy Jones told the newspaper. ""That's a real advance. But it's not yet proven.""However, even Jones said California officials should be prepared and on the lookout for action on the Garlock fault.The series of earthquakes in Ridgecrest in 2019 culminated in the largest seismic event in the state since the 1999 7.1 magnitude Hector Mine quake, according to an abstract of the report.The Ridgecrest activity ""produced significant stress perturbations on nearby fault networks, especially along the Garlock fault segment immediately southwest of the 2019 Ridgecrest rupture,"" according to that brief summary.The question is whether that stress may have begun a chain of events that could result in a widespread devastation along the San Andreas fault not seen since 1857, The Times noted.A year ago, the U.S. Geological Survey -- the nation's primary earthquake science agency -- calculated that there was an extremely remote chance the San Andreas could be triggered by the Ridgecrest quakes, the newspaper reported.     Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     In Other News Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings."

According to a shakemap on the U.S. Geological Survey website, the quake was felt throughout the municipality and as far away as the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. The Alaska Earthquake Center said Tuesday’s quake is an aftershock of the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that occurred on Nov. 30, 2018.

     Mexico hit by magnitude 7.4 earthquake that triggered a tsunami alert for Pacific coastlines along Central America. The powerful earthquake that rocked southern Mexico on Tuesday is now blamed for at least six deaths, including a worker at the country's largest oil refinery, according to officials.  “We lost everything in one moment to nature,” said Vicente Romero, an owner of a stationery store in the resort town of La Crucecita who told Reuters his home suffered structural damage. “This is our life’s work."" MAGNITUDE 7.4 EARTHQUAKE STRIKES MEXICO, AT LEAST 2 DEAD IN BUILDING COLLAPSES The national Civil Protection Center said right before midnight a sixth fatality was reported in the southern state of Oaxaca, the epicenter of the quake where at least 500 homes were damaged. A magnitude 7.4 earthquake in southern Mexico was felt several hundred miles away. (Fox News) Among the dead were a worker at Mexico's largest oil refinery who fell from one of the plant's structures, according to the civil protection agency.

THE ""RING OF FIRE' EXPLAINED At least six people were injured, including two in Mexico City, more than 300 miles north of the epicenter, where the shaking sent tens of thousands of people fleeing into the streets.  Officials told El Universal that at least 10 health centers, already busy battling the coronavirus pandemic, sustained damage from the tremors. Eight hospitals scattered along the coast in Oaxaca were the most severely affected. ""Unfortunately, the earthquake was significant enough to cause damage to the ceilings, doors, facilities and walls, but the reports I have so far are that there are no structural damages,"" Oaxaca Deputy Director of Health Services Juan Carlos Marquez Heine told the news outlet.

Let’s pray for them. May the help of God and our brothers give them strength and support. Brothers and sisters, I am very close to you,” he said at his weekly general audience. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Mexico's Pacific coast is located along the volatile ""Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of fault lines around the ocean. The region has most of Earth's subduction zones, where oceanic plates slide under the lighter continental plates. Earthquakes can occur when those plates scrape or subside underneath each other. At sea, it can spawn tsunamis. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region of Mexico where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 magnitude 8.0 quake.

"Nevada 'dodged a bullet' when 6.5 earthquake struck in a remote area, seismologist says",2020-05-16 13:46 UTC,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/16/nevada-earthquake-cracked-i-95-remote-area/5205375002/,"RENO, Nev. — Nevada's largest earthquake in 66 years left little more than cracked asphalt and shaken residents in its wake, but according to the top scientist at the state's seismological lab, Friday's 6.5 temblor was a near miss.  ""We dodged a bullet in many ways in terms of where it was,"" said Graham Kent, the director of the Nevada Seismological Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno.  The quake, centered in a remote area 36 miles west of Tonopah, was felt across three states. It ruptured nearby U.S. 95 — a major artery between Las Vegas and Reno — and swung chandeliers in the quiet historic towns it was closest to.  But no injuries have been reported and structures — even notoriously unstable historic buildings — made it through seemingly unscathed.  Take that same earthquake and recenter it underneath Reno, a situation that's more when than if, and it could have yielded ""millions of dollars of damage and loss of life,"" Kent said.  That natural disaster would have only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which would vastly complicate the normal practice of placing displaced people in mass evacuation centers. Now, an evacuation center would place scores of people at risk for exposure to the virus, adding another layer onto an already complicated situation.   Though the largest quake of this sequence hit just after 4 a.m. Friday morning, Kent stressed Nevada is not yet out of the woods.  Aftershocks — some of them fairly strong — have been happening by the hundreds in the hours after the 6.5, Kent said.  The six strongest of them happened in the hour immediately after the quake, all of them above magnitude 4.5.  There's also a chance that what's currently being referred to as the mainshock — the 6.5 earthquake — was actually a foreshock, and the largest earthquake is yet to come.  The United States Geological Survey pegs the chance that a larger earthquake will happen in the next week in that region at about 4%.  But Kent said the odds are likely a bit higher than that. When the USGS calculates that percentage, it's using statistics from a much larger area than just western Nevada and eastern California, he explained.  Historically, large earthquakes hitting in pairs or as a series is fairly characteristic of the seismic zone that ruptured on Friday, which is known as the Walker Lane.  The Walker Lane is a 60-mile wide band of active faults that stretches from the Mojave Desert in southern California, through western Nevada (and the Reno area) and back into northern California.  Kent rattled off a list of famous Walker Lane earthquakes over the past 30 to 40 years which happened in pairs.  The 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence, which happened on the southern end of the Walker Lane and was responsible for Nevada's first earthquake-related death, was highlighted by a 6.4 foreshock on July 4 followed by a magnitude 7.1 mainshock on July 5.  Even the strongest earthquake ever recorded in Nevada, the 1954 Fairview earthquake east of Reno, was a series of five strong earthquakes. The strongest two — a 6.8 foreshock and the 7.1 mainshock — happened just four minutes apart.  Kent said his lab is deploying additional remote sensors in the area of Friday's earthquake sequence to get a better handle on what the ground is doing.  ""So whether (the odds of another large quake) are 4% or 20% or 35 percent, there is that potential we saw in Ridgecrest,"" Kent said. ""So it's important for us to maybe catch that with more equipment on the ground.""  While seismic activity continues near Tonopah and the risk for a larger earthquake remains, that doesn't mean Friday's earthquake sequence will trigger some sort of chain reaction that sets off a quake near one of Nevada's population centers.  That activity is just too far away from Las Vegas and Reno to cause a chain reaction like that, Kent said.  ""But that doesn't mean mother nature doesn't have a sense of humor and just randomly puts one nearby,"" he said, adding that residents of Nevada should be prepared by visiting shakeout.org/Nevada and learn the drop, cover and hold drill.  Sam Gross is a breaking news reporter for the Reno Gazette Journal who covers wildfires, emergencies and more.

"Large earthquake in Nevada desert felt in Sacramento, throughout California",2020-05-15 23:57 UTC,https://www.pennlive.com/nation-world/2020/05/large-earthquake-in-nevada-desert-felt-in-sacramento-throughout-california.html,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — A large earthquake struck in a remote area of western Nevada early Friday. The quake — initially reported by the U.S. Geological Service at a magnitude of 6.4 — could be felt in Sacramento, more than 300 miles away. The quake was reported just after 4 a.m. PDT near Tonopah, Nev., about 100 miles east of Yosemite National Park and roughly halfway between Reno and Las Vegas. Twitter was full of people reporting they felt the earthquake in Sacramento, Fresno and the San Francisco Bay Area. It was followed by a series of small aftershocks, the USGS reported. Friday’s earthquake was close in magnitude to a 6.5 earthquake that hit the Boise, Idaho, area on March 31. Some of the most recent earthquakes and aftershocks felt in Northern California came in March and shook the coast, with magnitude 4.8 and 5.8 quakes striking about 50 miles west of Petrolia in Humboldt County. According to a previous story in The Sacramento Bee, while the likelihood of a significant earthquake in Sacramento is considerably lower than in the Bay Area, that doesn’t mean it can’t occur, said Richard Armstrong, a Sacramento State professor who studies earthquake engineering. “It’s just less likely,” he said. Still, even if Sacramento doesn’t face the same earthquake threat as other cities such as San Francisco or Los Angeles, “it has felt the effects of earthquakes in the past and likely will in the future,” according to California Geological Survey spokesman Don Drysdale. For example, if a major earthquake were to hit near the city, the shaking could loosen sandy soil deposits, allowing water to penetrate and saturate the earth. The liquified soil could then lose its strength, cracking and moving underneath structures like levees and buildings, Drysdale said. Sacramento County could experience strong shaking during a large earthquake, but the resulting damage would be less than areas near major active faults such as the Bay Area. Buildings specifically designed to withstand earthquakes and other “well-built” structures would likely survive a major earthquake, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Shoddier buildings may have considerable damage or collapse entirely. In 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey created animations of different earthquake scenarios along the Hayward Fault, a major active fault that runs under East Bay, including Berkeley, Oakland and San Jose. Simulations of a strong magnitude-6.8 earthquake or more show Sacramento would likely experience significant shaking — the kind that would awaken most, and cause some dishes and windows to move or break, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. But smaller earthquakes are far more common, and those are usually experienced without an issue in Sacramento.

USGS reports magnitude-6.4 earthquake in western Nevada,2020-05-15 12:09 UTC,https://fox40.com/news/earthquake/usgs-reports-magnitude-6-4-earthquake-in-western-nevada/,"FOX40 Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       TONOPAH, Nev. (AP) — Authorities in western Nevada checked for possible highway damage following a magnitude 6.5 earthquake in a remote area early Friday.  The initial quake struck about 4.7 miles (7.6 kilometers) deep, the USGS said, and dozens of aftershocks were recorded in the next three hours, including two with estimated magnitudes of 4.9. There were no immediate reports of injury, but part of U.S. 95 was closed as state troopers and sheriff’s deputies from Esmeralda and Mineral counties checked that highway and State Route 360 for possible damage, the Mineral County sheriff’s office said. The Nye County sheriff’s office was also checking a report of possible damage to U.S. 95, Capt. David Boruchowitz told KSNV-TV in Las Vegas. “Other than that, just a bunch of people shaken up.” The quake occurred in a remote area of the state between Reno and Las Vegas. Social media users in California reported feeling the earthquake in Bakersfield, Fresno, the Bay Area and Sacramento. “It really shook a lot of groceries off the shelves,” Keith Hasty, an employee at a gas station in Tonopah, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Hasty said residents who frequented the store were all talking about the quake. “We have a lot of locals coming in saying their TVs were shaking, they felt it,” said Hasty. “No damage that I’ve heard of. My boss just called and said his garage shook.” The USGS site showed over 13,200 responses from users saying they felt the quake. Latest from the USGS.

Utah residents split on how prepared they felt for the Magna earthquake,2020-05-04 00:00 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/5/3/21240017/earthquake-residents-split-on-how-prepared-they-felt-magna-salt-lake-valley,"Chip Simpson looks up the street from behind what was a nearly 6-foot block wall in his Magna yard that was destroyed during a 5.7 magnitude earthquake on Wednesday, March 18, 2020. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — Utah residents have been warned for decades about the risk of the “big one” destroying homes, killing thousands and putting the Wasatch Front in a catastrophic mess. Yet in the aftermath of the moderate magnitude 5.7 earthquake that struck near Magna March 18, a new poll shows that about half of Utah residents didn’t feel like they were prepared for that shaker. The poll of 964 registered Utah voters taken by the Scott Rasmussen firm on behalf Deseret News and the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute shows 45% of respondents felt they were prepared, 46% felt they weren’t and 9% remain unsure.  On top of that uncertainty, more people than not aren’t convinced state and local governments are prepared either, with 39% unsure about government preparedness, compared to 35% who said yes, government is ready for an earthquake, and 26% who say it isn’t. The survey, done April 15-21,  also asked residents what, if any action, they took afterward to prepare for future disasters, with the overwhelming majority buying supplies, at 58%, while 32% engaged in learning more about what to do in the event of an earthquake. A slight number of people, 2%, said they reinforced the masonry at their home. The poll had a margin of error of plus/minus 3.2 percentage points. “There are definitely some positive results there and some I am not surprised about. We realize it has been a long time since anyone in Utah has felt an earthquake of that size,” said Joe Dougherty, spokesman with the Utah Division of Emergency Management. “It was clear this was a brand-new experience for many, many Utahns.” He added he wasn’t surprised to learn half of Utah residents didn’t feel prepared because even though the state has a culture of preparedness, it can be strange to get ready for something that hasn’t happened for so long. “When it does, that is when it puts your preparedness to the test,” he said. “Clearly we have always known Utah could improve its preparedness and this could be a catalyst for that.” As to the slight majority of Utah residents who don’t think state and local governments are prepared for a natural disaster, Dougherty said that makes sense if people aren’t tracking what government response is in place. “Someone is going to feel unsure of government preparedness if they are not aware of what government is doing,” he said. “Some of that is going to be on individuals to go out and find out what government is up to. I feel really confident about our preparedness, but I see it every day.” He urged residents to go to beready.utah.gov and learn more about the state’s emergency response team that meets every month, involving coordination among state agencies and first responders.  Earlier this week, the Utah Geological Survey released a four-year study that provides new detailed mapping of faults along the Wasatch Front that are capable of surface rupture. The survey said in a large earthquake, surface rupture could cause significant damage to homes, schools, businesses and other buildings along the Wasatch Front, as well as disrupt critical infrastructure.  Using high-resolution elevation surveys derived from laser sensors mounted on aircraft, researchers conducted the fault mapping and marked “special study zones” that will be essential planning tools for local governments when it comes to land use planning and regulation. The information will also be useful for potential homebuyers. While Magna’s earthquake was considered moderate, the survey said faults in the area are capable of generating earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7.6 and releasing 700 times more energy, according to the survey.  Any earthquake larger than about magnitude 6.5 can rupture the ground surface, producing fault scarps from a couple inches high to up to 20 feet high and 40 miles long on the Wasatch Front, researchers said. “As a result of this research, we better understand where we’ve had surface-rupturing earthquakes in the geologic past, and where we may have them in the future. Knowing where fault scarps are present helps us make better land use decisions now and in the future,” said the survey’s hazards geologist Emily Kleber. “This new study provides detailed fault mapping and delineates special study zones for the Wasatch fault zone from southern Idaho to central Utah.” The agency cautions that the mapping is not precise enough to safely locate specific buildings on individual lots, so ultimately government planners will have to use their own judgment when it comes to information provided in the special study zones. The study was the result of a collaborative effort between the Utah Geological Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey. Along with new imagery, researchers used previous geologic mapping and looked at studies of ancient earthquakes and historical aerial photography, and did field investigations. The study is available on the Utah Geological Survey’s website and also at the bookstore at the Utah Department of Natural Resources offices.  Copyright © 2023 Deseret News Publishing Company.

There were no immediate reports of damage. Sunday's quakes were preceded by a series of quakes that have been occurring since a magnitude 4.9 earthquake shook the area Friday evening. It was felt across Southern California, but there were no reports of damage in the Coachella Valley. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said aftershocks were expected after Friday's initial quake, but added that those in Anza were ""on the high side of average."" Three of the smaller earthquakes happened Sunday morning and each was between magnitude 2.5 and 2.8, according to USGS.

People react to a historic earthquake in Idaho,2020-04-01 22:58 UTC,https://www.kivitv.com/news/people-react-to-a-historic-earthquake-in-idaho,"Menu  Even though we felt it in the Treasure Valley because the epicenter was in a remote area the earthquake didn't do very much damage, still it caused quite the reaction surprising us all. ""I thought it was just the wind outside the house so I got up and raised the blind and it was sunny outside,"" said Boise resident Chris Wadner. ""I didn’t have any pictures fall off the wall or mirrors or anything like that, I don’t think there was any damage.” There was some damage as a cross a top St. John's Cathedral in Boise was cracked, but there were no reported injuries because of the earthquake. Idaho Power found no damage to the 17 dams they manage, the Idaho Transportation Department has been clearing debris off the highways and ITD also closed down avalanche alley blocking the route from Stanley to Lowman, however, they did that before the earthquake happened. We also made a trip to Idaho City and residents there told from a distance (COVID-19 Social Distancing) there was only minor damage, but the quake shook their house pretty intensely.  So far there have been dozens of aftershocks and seismologist Jim Zollweg told us we can expect more in the coming days. “Probably the biggest aftershock will be somewhere in the range of five to five and a half  that kind of magnitude of Earthquake would only be lightly felt in the Boise area,"" said Zollweg. ""If the earthquake would have been in a populated area there would have been significant property damage."" So for now it looks like we were are able to come through the latest curveball 2020 has thrown at us as Idaho recorded the fifth largest earthquake in the world this year. ""Some years are like this, some years are calm you, just never know,"" said Wadner. Experts tell us the quake has no connection to super volcano in the Yellowstone National Park area, but people felt the earthquake in the states surrounding Idaho including in Bozeman, Montana where I grew up. People there say they felt it and Bozeman is located 90 miles north of Yellowstone."
U.S. Geological Survey reports magnitude 6.5 earthquake has struck Idaho,2020-04-01 08:39 UTC,https://www.fox13news.com/news/u-s-geological-survey-reports-magnitude-6-5-earthquake-has-struck-idaho,"Share BOISE, Idaho - An earthquake struck north of Boise Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking. The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke’s Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn’t interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho’s coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation’s highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. “It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said. The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.” Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it. “I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I’m sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.” Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay. That quake was along what scientists call a “normal fault,” with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday’s quake appeared to be on an unmapped “strike-slip fault,” causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line. “This is one that wasn’t obvious enough to be mapped before now,” Jones said. Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they’re less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists. Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake. “An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn’t surprise us,” she said. “They do every bit as much damage.” People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said. “Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,” Jones said. “Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake.

Earthquake shakes Boise with 6.5 magnitude that could be Idaho's second-strongest ever,2020-04-01 02:32 UTC,https://www.pennlive.com/news/2020/04/earthquake-shakes-boise-with-65-magnitude-that-could-be-idahos-second-strongest-ever.html,"Boise has a lot of attractions, and for two weeks, free parking in city garages has been one of them.Courtesy of Visit Idaho By Chadd Cripe, Ximena Bustillo, Kate Talerico, Hayley Harding, Nicole Blanchard and Nicole Foy | The Idaho Statesman  The shaking was reported to last for 20 to 30 seconds, with a small pause. U.S. Geological Survey pegged the earthquake at 6.5 magnitude with an epicenter in the mountains northwest of Stanley. The epicenter was about 28 miles west of Challis, the National Weather Service said.   “Stuff was flying all over the place,” Botti said. “I was upstairs and I tried to walk down the steps and I couldn’t because it was shaking too much.” According to the Idaho Statesman archive, the 6.5 magnitude would be the second-largest earthquake in Idaho history if it stands (the number often is adjusted with more information). The Borah Peak earthquake, which was a magnitude 6.9, killed two people in Challis near the quake’s epicenter. The second-largest is a three-way tie at 5.8 from 1983-84. The five strongest previous Idaho earthquakes were all in the Challis area. Expect more earthquakes in the days to come, USGS says. There’s a 99% chance of aftershocks of magnitude 3 or higher and a 48% chance of a magnitude 5 quake or higher, its forecast says. “According to our forecast, over the next one week there is a 4% chance of one or more aftershocks that are larger than magnitude 6.5,” the USGS forecast says. “It is likely that there will be smaller earthquakes over the next one week, with 4 to 790 magnitude 3 or higher aftershocks. Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily.” “We don’t have any reports of damage just yet,” Hayley Williams of Boise Police said. “We haven’t sent any first responders out — police or fire,” Stephany Galbreaith of Meridian Police said. “Our first responders are out doing building checks downtown. We’ve already done a scan of all of our public works facilities and they all look good,” Boise Mayor Lauren McLean said. Idaho resident Anna Eberlin sent the Idaho Statesman a photo of a mirror that crashed in her house. “A large mirror fell off our wall and shattered,” she said. “It scared my kids and me half to death. Everyone is OK after some tears and nervous excitement about their first earthquake.” Typically Idaho earthquakes tend to occur in the central and southeast parts of the state. Recently, a swarm of low-magnitude quakes rumbled across Southern Idaho and parts of Utah and California. Idaho’s last strong earthquake was in 1983. Two earthquakes rattled the Boise area in the mid-1940s, according to the Idaho Geological Survey. Another in 1916 “wrecked several brick chimneys at Boise and sent residents rushing into the street.” There were immediate reports that the earthquake was felt in Coeur d’Alene, Twin Falls and Hailey in Idaho; Spokane, Wash.; Utah; and Missoula and Bozeman, Mont. “I am from Florida and we have always had hurricanes growing up, but I had never been in an earthquake,” Kurt Wisehart of Boise said. “This was the first time for me, which is why I walked out ’cause this is weird. Like, what’s everyone do?” Zach Borman of Meridian said he and his wife experienced nausea after the quake.  Spencer Tangen of the National Weather Service in Boise said it might not be unusual to feel aftershocks with an earthquake that size. So did McLean. “I’d just like the community to know that there is likely a very real possibility with a quake of that size that you’ll feel more,” McLean said. Savannah Brehmer, spokeswoman for FEMA Region 10, which includes Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, said you should not attempt to run outside or hide in a doorway during an earthquake. “Dropping, covering and holding on is the best action to take as soon as you realize an earthquake has hit,” Brehmer said. “That’s what’s going to keep your most precious organs safe from potential injury.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.

The earthquake struck north of Boise, Idaho, Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking. (Tyler Beyer via AP) BOISE, Idaho – An earthquake struck north of Boise Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking.  The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.  More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana, and Salt Lake City, Utah.  Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke's Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn't interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho's coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation's highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. “It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said.  The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.” Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it.  “I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I'm sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.” Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay.  That quake was along what scientists call a “normal fault,” with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday's quake appeared to be on an unmapped “strike-slip fault,"" causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line.  “This is one that wasn't obvious enough to be mapped before now,” Jones said.  Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they're less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists.  Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake.  “An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn't surprise us,” she said. “They do every bit as much damage.” People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said.  “Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,"" Jones said. “Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake.

Bridge inspections still underway in aftermath of Utah earthquake,2020-03-20 20:12 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/3/20/21188330/magna-earthquake-salt-lake-valley-bridges-safety-inspections,"Utah Geological Survey hazards geologist Emily Kleber measures the length of a crack along the road to the Great Salt Lake Marina that was likely caused by Wednesday’s 5.7 magnitude earthquake&nbsp;near Magna, on Thursday, March 19, 2020. Kristin Murphy, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — Utah Gov. Gary Herbert declared a state of emergency on Friday to deal with the aftermath of Wednesday’s magnitude 5.7 earthquake. He stressed that state resources are available and gave praise to first responders. “I’m tremendously proud of how first responders and officials on the city, county and state levels worked together to respond to Wednesday’s earthquakes,” Herbert said “We are grateful that we had no major injuries and no fatalities as a result of this quake, but now we need to focus on helping our communities repair damages. “This declaration will help in that effort by expediting the use of state resources, as well as federal resources, should they be needed.”  In the meantime, the Utah Department of Transportation expanded its inspection of bridges in the aftermath of the earthquake to include pedestrian and railroad infrastructure, completing a close-up look of all 705 structures by Friday afternoon.  “The good news is we have only had one bridge that we have had to close and divert traffic from,” said UDOT spokesman John Gleason. The closure is the Fort Union flyover ramp to westbound I-215, which will likely be inspected more thoroughly in the next couple of days. “We are just not taking any risks with the safety of the bridges,” Gleason said. He added that 18 bridges have been “yellow-flagged” for further inspection of minimal damage that appears to be cosmetic. “It is not anything we are concerned about with structural damage,” he said. “We really want to make sure we are going over these bridges with a fine-tooth comb to make sure we are addressing any issues from the earthquake.” Keith D. Koper, director of the University of Utah Seismograph Stations, said there have been an estimated 500 aftershocks since Wednesday morning’s earthquake centered near Magna, and the number is changing minute by minute.  While that number seems dramatic, Koper said the aftershocks are decreasing in strength and will likely continue for weeks. The good news, however, is the more they continue, the risk decreases. “It is less and less likely the longer we go that we will have a big damaging aftershock,” Koper said.  Structural engineers were continuing to assess the damage Friday at the Rio Grande Depot, where chunks of plaster fell to the floor. The depot houses the Utah Department of Heritage & Arts and includes an interior walkway to the south where a building is home to the state archives. Department spokesman Josh Loftin said the building continues to be closed due to concerns about more plaster falling off the walls. The basement houses the state’s collection of artifacts. A couple were toppled in the earthquake, but not damaged, he said. Most concerning is the long-held fear that an earthquake could have triggered the automatic sprinkling system, damaging the precious items. That did not happen. “We have been lucky and we were lucky this time there was not damage to the artifacts,” Loftin said. The Great Salt Lake State Park Marina also continues to be closed but is expected to reopen sometime next week. Park officials have been grappling with a pair of gas leaks, a water pipeline that broke and roadway cracks caused by the earthquake.  An American Red Cross evacuation center at Taylorsville High School was scheduled to close Friday evening. Any residents in need of assistance should call 1-800-REDCROSS. Tina Brown, spokeswoman for the Salt Lake County Division of Emergency Management, said the county is rolling out a damage assessment survey to cities for residents to fill out so officials can get a better grasp on the extent of the earthquake’s impacts. She added it could be months or even into next year before the county has an exact picture of what buildings suffered damage.  “It is a fluid situation,” she said. West Valley City, where 49 mobile homes were condemned as uninhabitable, has a grant program that offers assistance up to $1,000, a mobile home repair program that offers one time grant assistance up to $6,000 and home rehabilitation loans of up to $25,000 at low interest.

Mobile home residents grappling with extensive damage after Utah earthquake,2020-03-20 02:17 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/3/19/21187388/western-estate-mobile-home-magna-west-valley-extensive-damage-earthquake,"A damaged trailer home in Magna on Thursday, March 19, 2020, following Wednesday’s 5.7 earthquake. Steve Griffin, Deseret News  WEST VALLEY CITY — Shane Cammack was sitting in the living room of his double-wide trailer Thursday afternoon when he felt the unmistakable rumble of an aftershock.  “I can see the needle moving right there,” he said, laughing as he pointed at the antique grandfather clock standing in the corner of his kitchen, its needle shaking back and forth like a homemade seismograph.    Cammack is one of many Western Estates residents whose home was deemed “restricted” after Wednesday’s 5.7 magnitude earthquake. Only about a mile from the epicenter, the small mobile home community on the West Valley-Magna border was hit hard by the temblor, which knocked trailers off foundations, shattered windows, and left residents temporarily without heat or water. “This should be covered with (homeowners) insurance,” said Cammack, whose trailer moved slightly off its foundation, a fix he said would still cost thousands of dollars. “If not, we’ve got a little bit of money in the savings.”    The Deseret News talked to over a dozen residents on Thursday, none of whom had earthquake insurance.   “It was just too expensive at the time,” Cammack said. “From now on I’m definitely going to have that kind of insurance.” Cammack was relatively lucky compared to some of his neighbors, whose homes were declared “unsafe,” meaning the occupants can’t return until they make substantial repairs. The majority of the nearly 50 structures deemed either unsafe or restricted by Salt Lake County were in Western Estates.  RHP Properties, the company that owns Western Estates, offered to pay April’s rent to all residents, and the American Red Cross is prepared to help people with temporary housing, food, clothing and medication.  But residents are still facing thousands of dollars in repairs and many are unsure of what to do next.    “It’s so expensive ... this will cost too much,” said Jose Otelles, a Western Estates resident whose trailer was left hanging off its foundation. A pink piece of paper with “UNSAFE” printed in bold lettering was taped next to his front door.  Otelles, who is now staying with relatives, stopped by his trailer Thursday afternoon to assess the damage. His homeowners insurance isn’t going to cover anything.     “I’m not covered for the earthquake,” Otelles said as he unloaded sheets of plywood from his pickup truck to board up the broken windows of his mobile home. “I hope somebody will help me fix this, maybe my friends.”  The earthquake damaged individual gas lines in the park, prompting Dominion Energy to temporarily shut off gas to the entire neighborhood.  On Thursday, Dominion Energy trucks lined the streets as workers tried to repair the damaged lines.  “We don’t currently have any gas or running water,” said Irving Fernandez, another Western Estates resident. “That’s why it’s so cold in here.” Dominion Energy spokesman Don Porter said most of the homes will have gas restored by Friday. But Fernandez and his father aren’t taking any chances, and the two loaded a car full bottled water and nonperishable food before going to stay with a relative in Rose Park.  In the aftermath of the earthquake, Fernandez said it looked like someone turned their house upside down. His TV jumped off the wall, glassware shattered and belongings were strewn across the trailer.  “I just heard everything falling and my dog was crying,” he said. “That’s when I heard my dad screaming out my name.”  Although county workers said the home is safe, Fernandez and his family won’t be back  until his father can reinforce the trailer’s foundation.  “He said he’s scared, he’s paranoid,” Fernandez said, translating for his Spanish-speaking father, Edgar Rodriguez. “We don’t really know what to do.” “We have to help our neighbors, we have to look out for each other,” said Cammack, who was inspired by the outpouring of support from his neighbors. “It’s a shame that it takes something like this, but it’s still nice to see.”  “I might not be able to fix your trailer,” said Janese Stewart, a Western Estates resident whose house sustained minor damages. “But I can be your friend.” Copyright © 2023 Deseret News Publishing Company.

Allred, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — Several Latter-day Saint buildings, including a dozen meetinghouses, were damaged by Wednesday’s earthquake in Utah, but no buildings on Temple Square suffered any structural damage, a church spokesman said in a statement on Thursday evening. Structural damage did strike the Humanitarian Center and Deseret Manufacturing facility owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, spokesman Daniel Woodruff said. “The Beehive Clothing manufacturing plant also sustained some damage to the interior of the building,” he said. “All those facilities remain closed until further notice.” The 12 meetinghouses that sustained structural damage are located in the Magna area. The church has contractors, consultants and church headquarters staff conducting additional assessments on the closed buildings and damaged meetinghouses. They conducted assessments of the buildings on Temple Square and those to the north of it, including all church headquarters buildings, over the 36 hours following Wednesday’s earthquake. Most of the buildings were evacuated during and after the earthquake, but all buildings at church headquarters have reopened to church workers and staff. They have been closed to the public for a week due to the spread of COVID-19. As was widely reported on Wednesday, the trumpet fell off the Angel Moroni statue atop the Salt Lake Temple during the earthquake, and some of the temple’s smaller spire stones experienced “minor displacement.” The temple is undergoing a four-year seismic upgrade project that began in January. No one was injured on Wednesday, but work ceased while a full assessment is conducted. Copyright © 2023 Deseret News Publishing Company. All Rights Reserved"

5.7 Magnitude Earthquake Hits Utah Leaving At Least 45K People Without Power,2020-03-18 16:20 UTC,https://www.inquisitr.com/5949761/earthquake-utah/,"A 5.7-magnitude earthquake has struck just outside of Salt Lake City, Utah, leaving tens of thousands of people without power, CNN reports. The earthquake, which couldn’t have come at a worse time for the metropolitan area of about 1 million people, struck as the city, like so many other American cities, is trying valiantly to stem the tide of the spreading coronavirus.  Here’s the shaking intensity map for this earthquake. As you can see, the stronger shaking is felt around the magna area and less intense shaking radiates outward.#Utquake pic.twitter.com/ifLrgdWrzG — Utah Division of Emergency Management (Utah DEM) (@UtahEmergency) March 18, 2020  As of this writing, there are no reports of injuries or fatalities. However, the disruption to the city will severely hamper its efforts to contain the coronavirus. “I know the last thing we need right now is an earthquake, but here we are, and it sounds like aftershocks are likely,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said.  The moment the earthquake hit #Utah we were downtown Salt Lake City#KSLTV #utahearthquake pic.twitter.com/lBDrt6F2Ri — Derek Petersen (@Derek_Photog) March 18, 2020  The state’s coronavirus hotline, which residents could call to request tests and seek information, went down, likely due to the power disruption from the earthquake. The building that houses the state’s public health laboratory is closed as it’s assessed for damage. That is bringing with it a screeching halt to the state’s anti-coronavirus efforts, even as the nation is in the midst of the deadly pandemic.

Across the region, crews are on the ground assessing the damage. As the city’s KSL-TV reports, the Mormon Temple, a major tourist attraction as well as a place of great spiritual significance for the state’s Mormon population, was slightly damaged, even as it was undergoing renovations to protect it against earthquakes.

     The Utah Emergency Management Center reports there’s shaking near Salt Lake City, Utah after magnitude 5.7 earthquake hit the impacted area; 55,000 people are without power. Tens of thousands of people in Utah are without power after an earthquake rocked the Salt Lake City metro area early Wednesday, causing some damage and closing the city's airport. The U.S. Geological Survey said the 5.7-magnitude earthquake was reported just after 7 a.m., with an epicenter located three miles north-northeast of Magna, and it occurred at a depth of six miles. The temblor and its aftershocks rattled a region of approximately 2.8 million people who are already hunkered down amid the coronavirus epidemic. “This is extremely bad timing, because we already have the coronavirus issue going on right now causing a lot of anxiety,” Gov. Gary Herbert said at a news conference. Herbert said the temblor was ""felt across much of the state,"" urging residents to follow proper safety measures in the event of any additional aftershocks or quakes. ""Please stay away from the downtown area while crews assess damage,"" Herbert tweeted. ""Unless you work in public safety, or are an essential employee, remain at home or telework."" CALIFORNIA RESERVOIR ORDERED TO BE DRAINED OVER FEARS EARTHQUAKE COULD COLLAPSE DAM The governor added the Utah Department of Health's state lab is assessing damage and is ""currently down."" ""The poison control center has been evacuated and the @UtahCoronavirus hotline is down,"" Herbert said.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) Capt. Anthony Burton of the Salt Lake City Fire Department told Fox News while the quake was centered about 10 to 15 miles west of Salt Lake City, the temblor was ""pretty strong"" in the city. Burton, a 13-year veteran of the department, told Fox News he has never felt an earthquake this strong in Salt Lake City. He added the fire department is currently doing a survey now of damage and that there were some reports of gas leaks.

As many as nine buildings in Magna were damaged in the quake, FOX13 reported. Operations at Salt Lake City International Airport came to a halt and the control tower and concourses were evacuated, the airport tweeted.

The airport's executive director, Bill Wyatt he expected the airport to reopen in “hours not days."" 5 OF THE MOST DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKES IN US HISTORY The quake also shut down the light rail service for Salt Lake City and its suburbs. Residents reported feeling shaking across a 100-mile area, with the heaviest impact in Salt Lake County, officials said. People were left asking “What the hell was that?” in one video posted to Twitter. Some residents ran from their homes and into the streets as they felt the earthquake shake buildings for 10 to 15 seconds. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints told FOX13 the Salt Lake Temple, which is undergoing a seismic upgrade, sustained some minor damage during Wednesday morning’s earthquake. ""The trumpet on the Angel Moroni statue fell off, and there is minor displacement of some of the temple’s smaller spire stones. No workers were injured,"" the church said. Crews on the job site have been sent home for the day, and a full assessment is underway to determine needs going forward.""

Utah earthquake causes Angel Moroni on Salt Lake Temple to lose his trumpet,2020-03-18 15:03 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/faith/2020/3/18/21185168/salt-lake-temple-angel-moroni-trumpet-lds-mormon-earthquake-utah,"The Angel Moroni statue atop the Salt Lake Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands with its trumpet missing after a 5.7 magnitude earthquake centered in Magna hit on Wednesday, March 18, 2020. Spenser Heaps, Deseret News SALT LAKE CITY — In the aftermath of Wednesday’s 5.7 magnitude earthquake, the Salt Lake Temple suffered some minor damage.  Most visible was the Angel Moroni’s missing trumpet. “The Salt Lake Temple, which is undergoing a seismic upgrade, sustained some minor damage during Wednesday morning’s earthquake,” said Daniel Woodruff, a spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “The trumpet on the Angel Moroni statue fell off, and there is minor displacement of some of the temple’s smaller spire stones. No workers were injured. Crews on the job site have been sent home for the day, and a full assessment is underway to determine needs going forward.

KSL-TV The statement added that no injuries have been reported to church employees and all church headquarter facilities have been closed to evaluate their safety until further notice. The Salt Lake Temple is currently under construction and in the middle of a major, four-year renovation. In January the temple was decommissioned and crews demolished the south wall and visitors center. This is not the first time an Angel Moroni on a temple spire has been damaged. In 2016, a lightning strike hit the statue atop the Bountiful Temple. A few months later a new Angel Moroni replaced the one that was damaged.

Please enter a search term.        SALT LAKE CITY (CNN) — A 5.7 magnitude earthquake shook Utah’s Salt Lake City area Wednesday morning, knocking out power in some areas, officials said.  “From what we have been able to determine, it doesn’t appear this was major shaking,” Utah’s Division of Emergency Management posted on Twitter shortly after the earthquake. Still, power has been knocked out in some areas, and aftershocks are likely, the division said. Details about the extent of the outages weren’t immediately available. At least six aftershocks had been recorded within 20 minutes of the main quake, according to the USGS. This is the state’s most powerful quake since 1992, when a magnitude 5.9 temblor struck the St. George area, the division said. Generally in Utah, earthquakes greater than magnitude 5 happen once every 10 years, and quakes greater than magnitude 6 happen once every 50 years, the USGS says. That statement takes into account instrumentation records dating back to 1962, and historical records dating back to the 1850s, the USGS says.

Miller's then-girlfriend said she was prepared. ""She said, 'Here let me show you,'"" Miller recounted. ""She goes to the closet and there's two bottles of water, one of them is leaking, a can of food and she doesn't have a can opener and a first aid kit that's been picked through. She was like, 'You know what? I'm not prepared either.'"" For Miller and Hallgren, that moment was a realization that they were not prepared to deal with crisis, and neither were most people. It was the foundation for the duo's bootstrapped start-up Redfora, makers of ""Earthquake Bag"" emergency kits. ""That really opened up our eyes,"" Miller said. ""We could not only help other people get prepared, but there's a business opportunity there as well."" The two put together earthquake-preparation kits for themselves and their friends, and as an experiment, they also decided to buy enough supplies to build extra kits they could sell. Hallgren and Miller targeted the kits to Facebook users in San Francisco, and within a few weeks, the pair sold 50 of them that they personally drove and dropped off to their customers. ""They knew they needed to do something, but they knew they were never going to do it themselves,"" Miller said. What started as a side project has grown into a full business. Hallgren and Miller worked on Redfora on nights and weekends from 2015 through 2017, but by early 2018, the company was generating enough revenue that both of them quit their day jobs. Redfora claims it has driven eight figures of revenue and been profitable since its launch. Whether it's a natural disaster like hurricanes in the Gulf Coast, geopolitical tensions like international disputes involving President Donald Trump and countries like Iran and North Korea, or the constant flood of climate change news, customers are often motivated to buy the Earthquake Bag by headlines, Hallgren and Miller said. ""That's a big opportunity,"" Hallgren said. ""Unfortunately, it's on the right side of a dangerous trend."" The COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, for example, has been a boon for Redfora. The company has seen an increase in its sale of emergency kits, especially its recently launched ""N95 Mask Protection Kit,"" in correlation with the outbreak. ""We have sold thousands of these kits over the past month, and we were forced to set a hard limit of 10 kits per customer to prevent hoarding,"" Miller said. Redfora's flagship product is the Complete Earthquake Bag. The company sells it on Amazon and its own website starting at $114.99 with enough supplies for one person to last three days. This distinctly red bag includes water, food, a sleeping bag and tools like a hand crank radio and work gloves, among other items. The products can be further customized if bought on the company's website. There, customers can change how many people their bag supports, for how many days and for how long they want the supplies to last. Redfora's most expensive kit, the ""20 Year Earthquake Bag"" designed for six people for seven days, costs $741.99. Customers can also buy specialized kits like those designed for the car, the office or pets, which can be customized for dogs or cats. ""The biggest challenge is how do you get someone to go from 'this is too scary to think about,' or 'if there's a disaster, I'm going to die anyway, so why plan for it?' -- how do we get them to go from zero to the lowest-hanging fruit?"" Miller said. Redfora isn't the first company to specialize in emergency preparedness, but it has applied modern marketing tactics to an industry that has typically been spearheaded by mom and pop shops. To do this, the company has made a point to produce educational emergency preparedness content that prospective customers can find online. This includes the company's blog, which now has a million readers, and the Redfora ""Ultimate 47 Item Earthquake Checklist"" that people can use to make their own kits. ""Even if you don't spend a dollar with us, having another person who is prepared is someone else who might encourage one of their friends to get prepared,"" Miller said. More importantly, Hallgren and Miller rely on Facebook, Google and Amazon to target ads to folks who are thinking about getting prepared for emergencies. Although the traditional buyers of doomsday gear have been men in rural areas who tend to buy when Democrats get elected, Redfora has found a drastically different audience. The company says its customer base tends to skew toward liberal women in their 40s. ""It's the matriarchs of families,"" Hallgren said. ""Men who have traditionally been interested in emergency preparedness think that they can Rambo their way through a disaster. Females tend to plan ahead."" That was the case with Katie McDonagh, 27, a tech worker who lives in Oakland. In the summer of 2018, she was feeling uncertain and worried about her family as she read the news. She'd previously heard about the Earthquake Bag, and she decided that at the very least she could buy her parents a kit. ""Our world is unpredictable right now,"" McDonagh said. ""I had this vision that the worst could happen, and giving myself peace of mind that my family would be able to take care of themselves in the event of a disaster was reassuring to me.""

Earthquake risk prompts order to drain Calif. dam,2020-02-25 21:28 UTC,https://fox5sandiego.com/news/earthquakes/earthquake-risk-prompts-order-to-drain-calif-dam/,"FOX 5 San Diego Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Worried that an earthquake could collapse a big dam south of San Francisco, officials have ordered its reservoir to be completely drained by October to reduce the risk of floodwaters spilling into Silicon Valley. The 240-foot (73-meter) high earthen Anderson Dam, built in 1950 between San Jose and the community of Morgan Hill, poses too great a risk of collapse and must be fully drained by Oct. 1, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates dams, the Mercury News reported. “It is unacceptable to maintain the reservoir at an elevation higher than necessary when it can be reduced, thereby decreasing the risk to public safety and the large population downstream,” David Capka, director of the commission’s Division of Dam Safety and Inspections, wrote last week in a letter to the Santa Clara Valley Water District. Since 2009, the dam’s water level has been kept at a maximum of 74 percent of capacity because of an assessment that it could fail in a 7.2 quake. The reservoir is built along the Calaveras Fault. On Monday, amid the threat of another drought in California, Anderson Reservoir was just 29% full.  A seismic retrofit project has been underway because of its state classification in 2017 as being an “extremely high” downstream hazard. The Santa Clara Valley Water District said in a statement Monday that officials agree with the commission’s assessment that the reservoir should be drained ahead of the retrofit project, which is “complicated and time consuming.” “Valley Water has been working with several state and federal agencies through the years to secure the proper permits as the scope of the project has increased due to additional safety and design requirements,” Valley Water CEO Norma Camacho said. “A priority will be to design and build a large outlet pipe, which will provide greater control over the water levels and increase public safety,” she added in the statement.  Camacho said draining the largest reservoir in the district will likely kill wildlife downstream in Coyote Creek, including endangered steelhead trout, amphibians and reptiles. Coyote Creek flows from the dam through downtown San Jose to San Francisco Bay. If the dam collapsed, runoff could damage cities and rural areas from the San Francisco Bay through Monterey Bay to the south, including much of Silicon Valley, the water district said in a statement. More than 14,000 residents had to be evacuated in 2017 as water from swollen Coyote Creek, downstream of the Anderson Reservoir, flooded homes and temporarily shut down a portion of a freeway.  It came the same month as a spillway failed at the nation’s tallest dam, in Oroville in Northern California, leading officials to order the evacuation of nearly 200,000 people. The dam ultimately held, but an independent investigation cited “a long-term systemic failure ” by regulators and the dam industry to recognize and address warning signs. California spent $1.1 billion repairing the Lake Oroville spillway, enacted new emergency plan requirements and launched a review of 93 other dams with similar spillways. An AP investigation last year identified at least 1,688 high-hazard dams rated in poor or unsatisfactory condition in 44 states and Puerto Rico.  Complicating the issue this year, California may be heading into a new drought.  Stored water is an important part of the south San Francisco Bay Area’s supply — with enough water for the annual needs of at least 130,000 people as well as what the district considers an emergency supply. “While residents have done an excellent job of conserving water since 2013, another drought during this time frame could require everyone to significantly decrease their water use,” Camacho said. The agency is exploring other sources of water from outside Santa Clara County, she said.

GUANICA, Puerto Rico (CNN) — A magnitude 5 earthquake on Tuesday struck Puerto Rico, where people are still on edge from a series of quakes after last month’s deadly 6.4 temblor. It was the 11th earthquake of at least that size in the past 30 days, according to the US Geological Survey. The earthquake’s center was 13 miles southeast of Guanica on the southwest coast, according to the US Geological Survey.  The magnitude 6.4 earthquake on January 7 left one person dead, destroyed dozens of homes and structures, and left 300,000 without water and two-thirds of the island without power. Since late December, a series of quakes — about 500 of magnitude 2 or greater — have rattled Puerto Rico, hitting infrastructure already weakened from Category 5 Hurricane Maria that struck the island in September 2017.

So far there are no reports of injuries or damages. The earthquake struck close to where a magnitude 5.8 rocked Virginia and the East Coast back in 2011. That tremor was felt at an intensity of VII (Very Strong) on the Mercalli Scale. Several buildings were damaged in that quake and some people sustained minor injuries. The 2011 earthquake was felt in Washington D.C. and government buildings had to be evacuated. A later survey revealed there were cracks near the top of the Washington Monument, which was closed for repairs until 2014. Today’s earthquake did not see as big of a reach as the 2011 earthquake. Most likely, people in our area did not feel the quake. However, it was picked up on seismometers at the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg.  Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Seismograph with paper in action and earthquake – 3D Rendering    Seismograph with paper in action and earthquake – 3D Rendering    A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Tuesday about 80 miles from Jamaica, shaking people in the Caribbean and as far away as Miami. A tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica, or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. A tsunami threat alert was lifted Tuesday afternoon, a few hours after the quake. Alec Pultr, who lives in Ogier, Grand Cayman, said it wasn’t the first earthquake he’s experienced but it was the biggest “by far.” “We were simply working and things started to sway,” he told CNN. As the swaying and shaking became more violent, most people started to run; the ones who stayed behind got under their desks. People in Miami, 440 miles from the epicenter, felt shaking. Miguel Charon was on the 13th floor of a building on Brickell Avenue. He told CNN he felt the walls shake for 30 to 40 seconds. His initial thought was that it must have been caused by a machine of some sort. He said building officials issued an evacuation order and people left the building in a smooth and calm manner. Jose Borrego, who also works in the Brickell area, said he was in a meeting. “We felt slight movement of the building, then we got told to evacuate the building,” he said. “Once we came outside (we) noticed that there are evacuations every building in the area.” The earthquake appears to have been a “strike-slip earthquake,” in which tectonic plates slide against each other. This limits the threat of a devastating tsunami, which are more associated with “thrust earthquakes,” where a portion of the earth is thrust upward and causes the water to push up and outward, creating the tsunami. The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake had a preliminary depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). The quake hit 125 kilometers (77.6 miles) north-northwest of Lucea in Jamaica. The earthquake also was felt as far away as Havana. Some people in the Cuban capital were evacuating taller buildings. Cuba’s state media reported the earthquake was felt across the island in Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, Holguín, Las Tunas, Cienfuegos, Pinar del Río, Havana and the Isle of Youth. There are no initial reports of damage or casualties.

A tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica, or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. There were several aftershocks, including one the US Geological Survey said had a magnitude of 6.1. “Based on all available data, there is no significant tsunami threat from this (6.1) earthquake. However, there is a very small possibility of tsunami waves along coasts located nearest the epicenter,” the National Weather Service’s Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. The quakes come three weeks after a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck Puerto Rico. A tsunami threat alert was lifted Tuesday afternoon, a few hours after the quake. Earlier, a tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic.

     New bombshell from upcoming book 'Clinton Cash' A decade after Haiti's most deadly earthquake that claimed 316,000 lives, left 1.5 million homeless and another 1.5 million injured, the Caribbean country has seen little progress after billions of dollars were promised in aid. Ricot St. Paulin, senior manager of program support for Compassion Haiti, said recently that it's staggering to look back at the Jan. 12, 2010, magnitude-7.0 earthquake. CHRISTIAN WOMAN RAISED IN DRUG-INFESTED AREA OF PHILIPPINES INSPIRES HOPE IN HER COMMUNITY ""I can't really imagine that [the earthquake] happened to us. It's really huge,"" Paulin told Fox News. The Haitian-native lost his youngest brother in the quake who was 26 years old, but he thanks God they were at least able to locate his body to bury him. This 2010 photo shows Haitians living in tents following the country's most deadly earthquake. (Compassion Haiti) Now 10 years later, he has mixed reactions thinking back to that day and seeing the work Compassion has done in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. ""We have come so far but there is still a long way to go, especially at the country level,"" St. Paulin said. Billions of dollars were promised from the U.N. and other organizations but much of it was mismanaged or lost and little has been shown as people are still living in tents and poverty and homeless still abound.  ""The way the Haitian children are still living it's like we missed the momentum,"" he added. ""Things are even getting worse, unfortunately."" A man searching through the rubble of buildings in the wake of the Jan. 12, 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti.  ""There are still many challenges in Haiti,"" St. Paulin said. ""Keep praying for us so that we can have wisdom and guidance for the Lord. Pray also that our young leaders would be able to live in their roles impacting and changing the community."" But that hasn't stopped the progress for Compassion, a Christian ministry focused on child sponsorship.  ""We rose from the rubble,"" St. Paulin said of the work he's done with Compassion. ""The ministry has gotten stronger. We are serving more children."" They now have 353 church partners throughout the country helping more than 125,000 children and youth. School children and their families participate in a funfair day at an earthquake-proof school built by Compassion that opened in 2013. (Compassion Haiti) Compassion works with children in the most impoverished parts of the country. In the devastating aftermath of the quake, they reopened the office and hit the ground running. They opened a disaster response office and built 30 earthquake-proof school buildings so children have a safe place to be. Compassion also offered microloans to affected families so they could feed their families. St. Paulin said there have been so many encouraging stories from their efforts. One of the earthquake-proof school buildings built by Compassion in the wake of the deadly 2010 earthquake. (Compassion Haiti) One single mother of seven was a fisher before the earthquake but was left hopeless and with nothing. After getting the microloan, however, today she funs a freezing fish business and provides fish to other restaurants. She is able to take care of her kids and extended family, as well as employing others. It's stories like these that keep St. Paulin going and make him so grateful for support from sponsors around the world that make their work possible.

Please enter a search term.     PUERTO RICO (CNN) — An earthquake with a 5.9 magnitude rattled Puerto Rico on Saturday morning, the US Geological Survey reports.  The quake was about 8 miles south of Indios in the Caribbean Sea, the USGS said, at a depth of 6.2 miles. The USGS first said the preliminary magnitude was 6.0. Puerto Rico has been beset by temblors throughout the week, including a 6.4 magnitude quake Tuesday that killed at least one man, destroyed homes and left most of the island without power. A 5.2 magnitude aftershock struck on Friday afternoon. The US territory was expecting power to return by Saturday to its 3 million residents, and authorities had tweeted that it was 95% restored a couple of hours before Saturday’s quake at about 8 a.m. ET. Parts of Lares, Adjuntas, Ponce and San German lost electrical service after the new quake, the power company Electric Energy Authority said. After the tremor, power was on to about 93% of the island, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority said. The earthquake renewed fear and anxiety among residents in the southern towns of the island. In Ponce, parts of the roof and facade of a historic building collapsed. Luis Emanuelli, who owns a restaurant in the building, said that while the interior was not damaged, he and his team decided pick up a few documents, some equipment and close indefinitely. “We don’t know what we are exposed to,” he said.  That storm killed almost 3,000 people, and left millions of Americans without power, water or shelter. Recovery has been slow and hard. Amid the earthquakes, Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced this week declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard. She told people to stay calm and expect aftershocks. Many took mattresses, tents and tarps into their yards to sleep, afraid of what aftershocks could do to their homes, already stressed or damaged. More than 6,000 people were staying in shelters, Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, the territory’s nonvoting delegate to Congress, said Friday.  “Relief workers, neighbors who’ve had to evacuate, and others impacted by the event” are eligible to book rooms at no cost, Airbnb says. “If you’ve been displaced or are helping with relief efforts, you can book free accommodations between January 9, 2020 and January 31, 2020.” Residents can also donate space for those in need of temporary housing.

Puerto Rico earthquake: Roughly two-thirds of island without power amid dozens of aftershocks,2020-01-09 01:05 UTC,https://fox40.com/2020/01/08/puerto-rico-earthquake-roughly-two-thirds-of-island-without-power-amid-dozens-of-aftershocks/,"FOX40 Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       (CNN) — Roughly two-thirds of Puerto Rico remains without electricity, many still don’t have water and frightened residents were staying outside as a series of aftershocks rocked the island following a magnitude 6.4 earthquake. The quake was the strongest and likely the most damaging of hundreds of temblors that have struck the island since December 28. It hit before dawn Tuesday, leaving a man dead and causing dozens of homes and structures to crumble. It was centered off Puerto Rico’s southern coast, 6 miles south of Indios. Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with residents to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks. Terrified of sleeping indoors as aftershocks continue, neighbors put mattresses in their front yards while others spent the night Tuesday under white tents and tarps. Noelia de Jesus has been sleeping at an outdoors shelter with her granddaughters, terrified of returning to her Guanica home. “I’ve been crying ever since it happened,” de Jesus told CNN. “Everything is broken … the house is leaning to the right. If another (earthquake) comes, it’s going to go down.” It’s the third time that a natural disaster leaves her without a place to live. Like her, many Puerto Ricans lost their homes when Hurricane Maria hit the island two years ago and Hurricane George struck in 1998. Guanica Mayor Santos Seda said about 50 homes were destroyed by the earthquake and at least 100 more were “about to collapse” on Wednesday. Hundreds of aftershocks have hit the area in the past few days. As of Wednesday afternoon, the island in just 24 hours had experienced about 50 seismic events of magnitude 2.5 or higher, the US Geological Survey said. A 4.7 earthquake was reported Wednesday afternoon off the southern coast of the island, about 8 miles southeast of Tallaboa, USGS said. The National Weather Service office in San Juan said there was no tsunami threat. Residents and officials have repeatedly said the impact from the quakes surpasses the devastation that Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm when it hit the island, delivered two years ago. “With the hurricane, you knew when and at what time it would arrive,” Guayanilla resident Tatiana Rodriguez, 28, said, adding of the quakes, “This, you don’t know at what time it’s going to happen.” The town of 18,000 located near the southern coast hasn’t been getting regular updates, she said. Residents are disinclined to leave their homes because they don’t know what areas are safe. Rodriguez worries that recovery will be difficult, especially for those hit hard by Maria, she said. “There are a lot of people that started from zero because of Maria,” she said. “(They’re) starting again from zero.” Ashley Rodriguez Perez, 22, hasn’t seen her partner since Saturday. He was receiving treatment at a clinic in Guanica, about 12 miles west of Guayanilla, but patients were moved after the quakes and she doesn’t know where he is. She doesn’t think he knows where she is, either, she said. Perez and her relatives, including her 58-year-old father, took shelter at Gloria Maria Borrero School in Guayanilla after Perez’s apartment began “separating from the sidewalk,” she said. She’s been without power for two days, and the balcony of her apartment is “a bit toppled” as well, she told CNN on Tuesday. “I never thought a quake would destroy so much,” she said. “Hurricane Maria was nothing compared to this.” Much of Puerto Rico is still without power Wednesday as engineers work to restore it in phases. About 500,000 customers, roughly one-third of the island, are back on the grid, the Electric Energy Authority said in a tweet. A system-wide power outage was reported after the Costa Sur power plant near Guayanilla suffered severe damage Tuesday, Vázquez Garced said. “We lost the largest plant in the entire system,” said Jose Ortiz, executive director of the Electric Power Authority. Power has been restored in most hospitals, and crews are working to fully restore it by the weekend, Ortiz said. A nursing home in Ponce was evacuated and dozens of people in wheelchairs were waiting outside. Guanica experienced at least 10 aftershocks Wednesday before 8 a.m. (7 a.m. ET), Mayor Seda said. More than 200 people took shelter at a Guanica coliseum, he said, but fearful for their safety if the building were toppled, they relocated to the parking lot. “So much worse than Maria, because a hurricane, we can tell where the hurricane is coming through, but we don’t with an earthquake,” Seda told CNN. “Yesterday, my wife and I slept on the sidewalk right outside my house, and we saw the same thing everywhere.” Classes won’t resume across the island until crews inspect all schools and confirm buildings are safe for students, education officials announced. The Agripina Seda School in Guanica suffered major damage Tuesday, including a partially collapsed, three-story building. “Classes in the public school system won’t resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,” Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won’t return to the schools until further notice. The earthquakes come after Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory in September 2017. Many in southern Puerto Rico said the earthquakes’ damage was worse. “There’s no warnings for this,” Puerto Rico Police Commissioner Henry Escalera said of the earthquakes. “A hurricane gives us time to plan ahead.” When asked what concerns him the most about the quakes’ aftermath, he said, “That homes will not be safe to live in and the possibility of a collapse that will cause a person’s death or serious injuries.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced aid has been made available to supplement local response efforts. President Donald Trump’s action authorizes FEMA to coordinate all disaster relief efforts and provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures to save lives and protect property.

     An earthquake hitting off the southern coast of Puerto Rico reportedly causes major damages and power outages. Schools across Puerto Rico remained closed on Wednesday as more than a half-million people remained without electricity after the island's worst earthquake in a century. President Trump declared an emergency, freeing up federal funds, and Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez activated the National Guard after the magnitude 6.4 quake struck Tuesday, killing one person and injuring nine others while knocking out power across the U.S. territory. Vázquez, who also declared a state of emergency, said power should return to most of the island in 24 to 48 hours. “All of Puerto Rico has seen the devastation of this earthquake,” Vázquez told reporters. PUERTO RICO EARTHQUAKE CAUSES POPULAR TOURIST ROCK FORMATION TO COLLAPSE Some Puerto Ricans in the hard-hit south area of the island in towns such as Guánica moved beds outside Tuesday night over concerns their homes would collapse if another earthquake hit. The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico's southern region began the night of Dec. 28. 96 years-old Martin Velez gets placed in a bed by neighbors outside a shelter afraid of aftershocks, after an earthquake in Guanica, Puerto Rico, Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020. (AP Photo/Carlos Giusti) In Guánica, more than 200 people took shelter in a gymnasium after a quake Monday, only for the latest temblor on Tuesday to damage that structure — forcing them to sleep outside. “There's no power. There's no water. There is nothing. This is horrible,” Lupita Martínez, 80, told the Associated Press as she sat in the parking lot with her 96-year-old husband.

In Guánica, a town of roughly 15,000 people, nearly 150 homes were affected by the quake, along with three schools, including a three-story structure where two floors were completely flattened.

(AP Photo/Carlos Giusti) Tuesday's quake was the strongest to hit Puerto Rico since October 1918, when a magnitude 7.3 quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people. Nearly all of the island’s more than 3 million people lost power and only 100,000 customers had energy by late Tuesday night, according to the AEE electricity authority. Puerto Rico’s southern coast was hit with a 6.5 magnitude earthquake. The quakes have been regularly occurring since December 28 and now an island-wide blackout is being reported. The agency scrambled to restart power plants that automatically shut down for safety during the quake. The large Costa Sur plant suffered “severe damage” and was put out of service, Vázquez said. PUERTO RICO HIT WITH 6.4 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE, ISLANDWIDE BLACKOUT REPORTED Authorities said they were working on how to shelter people as they handed out blankets, food, and water to families gathered at the gymnasium in Guánica for the second night in a row. Many who spent the night sleeping in their cars or outside said they were used to hurricanes, but nothing like what has been happening.

CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. Geologic Survey said that while it’s virtually certain there will be many aftershocks in the next week, the chance of a magnitude 6 quake -- similar to Tuesday’s -- or stronger is around 22 percent. Puerto Rico is still recovering from when Hurricane Maria hit in 2017, causing an estimated 2,975 deaths and more than $100 billion in estimated damage. The island is also working through a bankruptcy process to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"Punta Ventana, one of Puerto Rico's natural wonders, has been destroyed by an earthquake",2020-01-07 20:53 UTC,https://fox40.com/2020/01/07/punta-ventana-one-of-puerto-ricos-natural-wonders-has-been-destroyed-by-an-earthquake/,"FOX40 Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       (CNN) — Hours after a deadly 6.4 magnitude earthquake rocked Puerto Rico, people on the southern coast fear more homes could soon collapse and most of the people on the island remain without power. Tuesday’s quake — the strongest and likely the most damaging of a series of quakes that have hit the island since December 28 — left a man dead, caused dozens of homes and structures to crumble and cut power and water service to swaths of the island. Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with people to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks. “We have responded to many difficult situations, and here we are once again … helping our people move forward,” Vázquez said. Engineers were working to reestablish service to close to 300,000 of the island’s 1.1 million utility customers who were without water service Tuesday, Vázquez said.  In the town of Guanica, families sat on white plastic chairs and cots in the parking lot of the Mariano “Tito” Rodriguez Municipal Coliseum. About 255 have been taking shelter there since a 5.8 magnitude quake shook the US territory on Monday but officials now fear the building it’s not stable. “My home is like a hammock,” said Hector Cruz, a resident of Guanica. “It’s like a drill coming from underneath the home.” The earthquakes come more than two years after Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory in September 2017 and many in southern Puerto Rico said the earthquakes damage had been worst. Puerto Rico Police Commissioner Henry Escalera told CNN there’s not way to compare both disasters. “There’s no warnings for this,” he said about the earthquakes. “A hurricane gives us time to plan ahead.” When asked about what concerns him the most about the aftermath of the earthquakes, Escalera said, “It’s our homes… that homes will not be safe to live in and the possibility of a collapse that will cause a person’s death or serious injuries.” In the city of Ponce, roughly 15-mile drive east of Indios, a 77-year-old man was killed and at least eight others were injured Tuesday, Ponce emergency management director Angel Vasquez said. More than 400,000 of Puerto Rico’s 3.1 million people would have felt strong or very strong shaking, the USGS estimates, though the entire island would have felt lesser effects. Zulma Bracero, deputy mayor of Guanica, told CNN that authorities were providing tents to help residents sleep outdoors on Tuesday night. She said nothing seems safe and the situation is worse than the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Riko Gonzalez and his parents were sleeping in their home in Yauco, near Indios, when the 6.4 quake struck. They awoke to a rumble and scurried out of the house. China and glasses were smashed on the kitchen floor, he said. It was “horrible, nothing compared to the (magnitude) 5s from yesterday,” Gonzalez told CNN. “People are afraid to go to bed, to then be woken up to worse earthquakes than the day before,” he said. In Guayanilla, just north of Indios, parts of the Inmaculada Conception church were in ruins Tuesday. Part of an exterior wall collapsed, and piles of rubble lay on the ground, pictures posted to Facebook showed. Homes also were damaged in Guayanilla, Mayor Nelson Torres said in a phone interview with CNN affiliate WAPA. The Guayanilla area already was counting its losses from a day earlier. A significant tourist attraction, the picturesque Punta Ventana rock formation and arch on the coast, collapsed because of Monday’s shaking, the mayor said. In Ponce, workers at Damas hospital were evacuating all patients Tuesday morning except for those in intensive care, the facility’s Executive Director Dr. Pedro Benitez told WAPA. “(Patients) were running around the hallways, so we had to get them out of the building for their own safety,” Benitez said. Tuesday’s quake continues a series of seismic events that have shaken Puerto Rico across 11 days. Hundreds of small earthquakes have hit the island since December 28, the USGS says, including at least 29 over magnitude 4.0. Monday morning‘s 5.8 tremor struck just south of Indios. While that quake damaged some homes in Guanica and Guayanilla, no serious injuries were reported. The earthquakes since December 28 appear to have been foreshocks to Tuesday morning’s largest quake, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. Tuesday’s quake “will trigger aftershocks, but these will decrease in frequency over time,” the USGS said in a news release. It likely will be the island’s most damaging earthquake in more than a century. In 1918, a strong quake shook Puerto Rico and caused a tsunami, resulting in 116 deaths and economic loss of $4 million, two times the annual budget for the whole island at the time, according to the Puerto Rico Seismic Network. That’s about $73.4 million in buying power today, according to the government’s Consumer Price Index inflation calculator. This is the largest earthquake to hit Puerto Rico since 2014, when a 6.4 magnitude quake struck 61 miles northeast of the island. That quake briefly disrupted power and caused only minor damage to Puerto Rico, as it was centered much father offshore than Tuesday’s earthquake. It’s unclear what the full extent of the damages in Puerto Rico be but experts say the island could need hundreds of millions of dollars in aid. Chuck Watson, an analyst with Georgia-based Enki Research, a disaster research group, said the quakes could cost the island up to $3.1 billion in economic losses. The estimate accounts for damage to both public and private property, as well as lost tourism, wages and business due to power outages. USGS has estimated the earthquake could cause economic losses greater than $100 million. Watson says his estimate includes how multiple aftershocks can potentially damage weak structures, as well as the lingering damage left by Hurricane Maria. Some of the infrastructure damage is still not rebuilt following the 2017 storm, the American Society of Civil Engineers has said. Following the damage from hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, Congress appropriated $42 billion to the recovery effort in Puerto Rico, $16 billion of which went through FEMA, $20 billion through Housing and Urban Development, and the remainder through more than a dozen smaller agencies. Only about $14 billion of these funds have been spent.

Please enter a search term.       PETRINJA, Croatia (AP) — A strong earthquake in Croatia destroyed buildings and killed at least seven people Tuesday southwest of the capital, displacing scores of area residents or making them afraid to sleep indoors as emergency teams searched for those still missing by nightfall.  Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. Another six people were killed in nearly destroyed villages close to the town, according to HRT state television. At least 26 people were hospitalized, six with serious injuries, officials said, adding that many more people remained unaccounted for. In Petrinja, cries could be heard from underneath destroyed houses. One woman was found alive some four hours after the quake. Emergency teams used rescue dogs in the search for survivors, while family members looked on in despair. “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT. “This is like Hiroshima – half of the city no longer exists.” Firefighters worked to remove the debris from a collapsed building that fell on a car. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the vehicle and carried into an ambulance. The town was left without electricity or running water as officials scrambled to set up temporary accommodation for all of the displaced residents in need. Residents fearing another earthquake seemed poised to spend the night outside their homes. Petrinja resident Marica Pavlovic said the quake felt “worse than a war.” “It was horrible, a shock. You don’t know what to do, whether to run out or hide somewhere,” she told The Associated Press. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable,” Plenkovic said. He said the army has 500 places ready in barracks to house people, while others will be accommodated in nearby hotels and other places. “No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” the prime minister said. Officials also toured a damaged hospital in the nearby town of Sisak, which was also badly hit. Plenkovic said the patients will be evacuated in army helicopters and ambulances. Health officials said a baby was delivered in a tent in front of the hospital in the aftermath of the earthquake. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that she spoke with Plenkovic and instructed an envoy to travel to Croatia as soon as possible. As a Mediterranean country, Croatia is prone to earthquakes, but not big ones. The last strong quake struck in the 1990s when the picturesque Adriatic coast village of Ston was destroyed. The Croatian military was deployed in the quake-hit region to help with the rescue operation. Croatian seismologist Kresimir Kuk described the earthquake as “extremely strong,” far stronger than another one that hit Zagreb and nearby areas in the spring. He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky old buildings and move to newer areas of the city because of aftershocks. In the capital, people ran into the streets in fear. The earthquake was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia and Slovenia. It was felt as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported. Authorities in Slovenia said the Krsko nuclear power plant was temporarily shut down following the earthquake. The power plant is jointly owned by Slovenia and Croatia and located near their border.

Deadly 6.3 magnitude earthquake rocks Croatia,2020-12-29 18:51 UTC,https://nypost.com/2020/12/29/magnitude-6-3-earthquake-strikes-croatia-6-deaths-reported/," PETRINJA, Croatia — A strong earthquake hit central Croatia on Tuesday, destroying buildings and sending panicked people fleeing into rubble-covered streets in a town southeast of the capital. Authorities said at least six people were killed and dozens were injured. The European Mediterranean Seismological Center said the magnitude 6.3 quake hit 46 kilometers (28 miles) southeast of Zagreb. It caused widespread damage in the hardest-hit town of Petrinja. The same area was struck by a 5.2 quake on Monday. Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. Another five people were killed in a nearly destroyed village close to the town, according to the state HRT television. At least 20 people were hospitalized, two with serious injuries, officials said, adding that many more people are unaccounted for. In Petrinja, cries could be heard from underneath destroyed houses. One woman was found alive some four hours after the quake. Emergency teams used rescue dogs while looking for survivors, while family members looked on in despair. “My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT. “This is like Hiroshima – half of the city no longer exists.” Marica Pavlovic, a resident, said the quake felt “worse than a war.” “It was horrible, a shock, you don’t know what to do, whether to run out or hide somewhere,” she told The Associated Press.

Regional TV channel N1 reported from Petrinja that a collapsed building had fallen on a car. The footage showed firefighters trying to remove the debris. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the car and carried into an ambulance. The Croatian military was deployed in the region to help with the rescue operation.

Second small earthquake near Carnation is the 4th PNW earthquake in 2 days,2020-12-29 16:12 UTC,https://www.q13fox.com/news/second-small-earthquake-near-carnation-is-the-4th-pnw-earthquake-in-2-days,"Share CARNATION, Wash. - A second small earthquake shook the Carnation area in King County Tuesday morning a day after two other small earthquakes were reported in Western Washington. A stronger 5.7-magnitude quake also struck off the Oregon coast early Tuesday.   The Northwest National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, said no tsunamis are expected.  The federal agency received 88 responses from people who said they felt the quake, but said little or no area was affected and no people were exposed to danger.   At least 116 people reported feeling the earthquake near Monroe, according to the U.S. Geological Survey’s ""Did You Feel It"" web page. No injuries or damage were reported in either quake, The Seattle Times reported. The Puget Sound region experiences earthquakes because it lies near the edge of the North American tectonic land plate and the Juan de Fuca, a large oceanic plate. The 700-mile (1,127 kilometer) boundary, a fault known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, runs from Northern California to Canada. Scientists say the Juan de Fuca plate is trying to force its way under the North American plate. Last year, an earthquake danger assessment by the U. S. Geological Survey said Puget Sound has a 75% or greater chance of being struck by a damaging earthquake in the next 100 years.

"""Many injured"" as strong earthquake strikes Croatia, Slovenia shuts power nuclear plant as precaution",2020-12-29 13:13 UTC,https://news.yahoo.com/many-injured-strong-earthquake-strikes-131325775.html,"By Antonio Bronic SISAK, Croatia (Reuters) - An earthquake of magnitude 6.4 struck central Croatia on Tuesday, killing seven people, injuring more than 20 and rattling several neighbouring countries, officials and residents said. Rescuers pulled people from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Petrinja and other towns, and army troops were sent to the area to help. Tremors were also felt in Croatia's capital Zagreb and as far away as Austria's capital Vienna. Slovenia shut its only nuclear power plant as a precaution. It was the second quake to strike the area in two days. The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences said it hit at 1119 GMT at a depth of 10 km (6 miles), with the epicentre in Petrinja, 50 km south of Zagreb. ""By now, in the vicinity of the town of Glina we have five fatalities. Together with a (12-year-old) girl from Petrinja there are altogether six dead,"" Deputy Prime Minister Tomo Medved said while visiting Glina. State news agency Hina, citing firefighters, later reported that a seventh victim had been found in the rubble of a church in the village of Zazina. Police said at least 20 people were slightly injured and six more severely wounded in the temblor. ""The search through the rubble is continuing,"" police said in a statement. Throughout the day many aftershocks occurred measuring 3.0 magnitude or slightly stronger. Tomislav Fabijanic, head of emergency medical services in Sisak, said many people were wounded in Petrinja and Sisak and their injuries included fractures and concussions.  The head of the hospital in Sisak said later it was treating 20 people, two with severe injuries. The N1 television station showed footage of rescuers in Petrinja pulling a man and a child alive from the debris. Other footage showed a house with its roof caved in. The N1 reporter said she did not know if anyone was inside. N1 also said a kindergarten was destroyed in the quake but that there were no children in it at the time. Piles of stone, brick and tiles littered Petrinja's streets in the aftermath of the quake, and cars parked in the road were smashed by falling debris. A worker who had been fixing a roof in a village outside Petrinja told N1 that the quake threw him to the ground. Nine of the 10 houses in the village were destroyed, he said. WRAPPED IN BLANKETS The quake was also felt in Zagreb, where people rushed onto the streets, some of which were strewn with broken roof tiles and other debris. Patients and medical staff were evacuated from Zagreb's Sveti Duh Hospital, with many left sitting in chairs in the street wrapped in blankets. In Austria's second city Graz, about 200 km (130 miles) north of Petrinja, tall buildings wobbled for about two minutes, according to broadcaster ORF. In Carinthia province, about 300 km to the northwest of Petrinja, the earth trembled for several minutes and people described how their furniture, Christmas trees and lamps wobbled. In Slovenia, the STA news agency said the country's sole nuclear power plant, 100 km (60 miles) from the epicentre, was shut down as a precaution.

According to the United States Geological Survey, the earthquake was recorded at a depth of 3.1 miles. No word on any damage but that’s the second earthquake within a month in that area. The other one was on Dec. 17, just 53 miles south of Carlsbad with a magnitude of 2.7. Earthquakes are caused by a sudden slip on a fault. The tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth’s crust and cause the shaking that we feel.

""People in New England, and in its geological extension southward through Long Island, have felt small earthquakes and suffered damage from infrequent larger ones since colonial times. Moderately damaging earthquakes strike somewhere in the region every few decades, and smaller earthquakes are felt roughly twice a year,"" USGS said.  Residents in the area woke up to the shaking and posted their experiences to social media.  ""I was just sitting at my desk when I felt what seemed like a large truck driving down the road. The shaking started to escalate and I realized I couldn't hear any truck driving by. That's when I realized it must be an earthquake!,"" Hayley Bascom told FOX TV Stations.

"At Least 51 Dead in Turkey, Greek Islands Earthquake",2020-11-01 12:32 UTC,https://www.voanews.com/europe/least-51-dead-turkey-greek-islands-earthquake,"


Print

 At least 51 people have been killed and nearly 900 injured by the earthquake that toppled buildings in the Turkish city of İzmir and created sea surges on at least two Greek islands. Rescue teams in Turkey early Sunday morning pulled a man alive from the rubble of a collapsed building. The man, identified as Ahmet Citim, survived for 33 hours under the debris of a residential building that was flattened during the earthquake. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Izmir on Saturday evening and promised the government would help victims who lost their homes with temporary housing and rent, and start construction of new buildings. The deadly 7.0 earthquake originated from a 250-kilometer fault line off the coast of the Greek island of Samos, streaming across the Aegean Sea that divides Turkey and Greece. Hundreds of aftershocks followed. Just hours after the quake, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis placed a rare telephone call to Turkish president to offer his condolences. “Whatever our differences, these are times when people need to stand together,” Mitsotakis posted on Twitter.  The United States has saluted the Greek-Turkish earthquake diplomacy and expressed readiness to help the two NATO countries. ""It's great to see both countries putting their differences aside to help each other during a time of need. The United States also stands ready to assist,"" said U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien. France also offered assistance to the countries, extending “full solidarity to both Greece and Turkey.” Although Greece and Turkey are both members of NATO, there are perhaps no two allied, neighboring nations whose dealings have been marked with so much conflict and mistrust. Most recently, both sides have been embroiled in a heated energy standoff in the eastern Mediterranean, bringing them to the brink of war during the summer. The European Union and the United States have been working for months in hope of sitting both sides down to negotiate their differences, but to no avail. It remains unclear whether the deadly earthquake can strengthen ties.  "
"Death toll reaches 38 in earthquake that hit Turkey, Greek island",2020-10-31 17:55 UTC,https://www.fox9.com/news/death-toll-reaches-38-in-earthquake-that-hit-turkey-greek-island,"Share  IZMIR, Turkey - Three young children and their mother were rescued alive from the rubble of a collapsed building in western Turkey on Saturday, some 23 hours after a powerful earthquake in the Aegean Sea killed at least 38 people and injured more than 800 others. One of the children died soon after being rescued, while a fourth child was still trapped. The Friday afternoon quake that struck Turkey’s Aegean coast and north of the Greek island of Samos registered a magnitude that Turkish authorities put at 6.6 while other seismology institutes said it measured 6.9. It toppled buildings in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, and triggered a small tsunami in the Seferihisar district and on the Greek island. Hundreds of aftershocks followed. At least 36 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD, said. Among them was an elderly woman who drowned in the tsunami. But rescue teams on Saturday made contact with 38-year old Seher Perincek and her four children — ages 3, 7 and 10-year-old twins — inside a fallen building in Izmir and cleared a corridor to bring them out. Search and rescue works continue at debris of Doganlar Apartment located in Bayrakli district after a magnitude 6.6 quake shook Turkey's Aegean Sea coast, in Izmir, Turkey on October 31, 2020.   One by one, the mother and three of her children were removed from the rubble as rescuers applauded or hugged. The survivors, including 10-year-old Elzem Perincek, were moved into ambulances on stretchers. “I’m fine; I was rescued because only one of my feet was pinned. That foot really hurt,” she said. The health minister as well as rescue worker Ahmet Yavuz told HaberTurk television hours later that one of the children had died after being rescued. They were still trying to reach the other child, Yavuz said. More than 5,500 rescuers from different agencies and cities worked together to reach survivors, at times hushing the crowds to listen into the rubble with sensitive headphones and crawling through the cracks. A 65-year-old man was saved 26 hours after the quake. Rescue work continued in nine buildings. Earlier Saturday, search-and-rescue teams lifted teenager Inci Okan out of the rubble of a devastated eight-floor apartment building. Her dog, Fistik, or Pistachio, was also rescued, Turkish media reported. A video showed a female rescuer trying to calm down the 16-year-old girl under the rubble as she inserted a catheter. “I'm so scared,” the girl cried. “Can you hold my hand?” “We are going to get out of here soon,” the rescuer, Edanur Dogan, said. “Your mother is waiting outside for you.” Two other women, aged 53 and 35, were brought out from the rubble of another toppled two-story building earlier on Saturday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Izmir and was being briefed at the crisis center. In all, around 100 people have been rescued since the earthquake, Murat Kurum, the environment and urban planning minister, told reporters. It was unclear how many more people were trapped under buildings that were leveled. AFAD said 885 people were injured in Izmir and three other provinces. The health minister said eight people were being treated in intensive care, with three of them in critical condition.  Two teenagers were killed on the island Samos after being struck by a collapsing wall. At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said. The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbor town of Vathi. The earthquake, which the Istanbul-based Kandilli Institute said had a magnitude of 6.9, was centered in the Aegean northeast of Samos. AFAD said it measured 6.6. and hit at a depth of some 16 kilometers (10 miles).  It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as Athens and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece as well. Authorities warned residents in Izmir not to return to damaged buildings, saying they could collapse in strong aftershocks. Many people spent the night out in the streets, too frightened to return to their homes, even if they sustained no damage.   In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity, and the leaders of Greece and Turkey held a telephone conversation. ""I thank President Erdogan for his positive response to my call,” the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Saturday before traveling to Samos, where he visited the families of the teenagers who were killed. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbors and nominal NATO allies. The quake occurred as Turkey was already struggling with an economic downturn and the coronavirus pandemic. So far, more than 10,000 people with the virus have died in Turkey. The health minister said authorities were distributing masks and disinfectant to protect against COVID-19. ___ Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey and Bilginsoy reported from Istanbul.

"Death toll reaches 38 in earthquake that hit Turkey, Greek island",2020-10-31 17:55 UTC,https://www.ktvu.com/news/death-toll-reaches-38-in-earthquake-that-hit-turkey-greek-island,"Share  IZMIR, Turkey - Three young children and their mother were rescued alive from the rubble of a collapsed building in western Turkey on Saturday, some 23 hours after a powerful earthquake in the Aegean Sea killed at least 38 people and injured more than 800 others. One of the children died soon after being rescued, while a fourth child was still trapped. The Friday afternoon quake that struck Turkey’s Aegean coast and north of the Greek island of Samos registered a magnitude that Turkish authorities put at 6.6 while other seismology institutes said it measured 6.9. It toppled buildings in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, and triggered a small tsunami in the Seferihisar district and on the Greek island. Hundreds of aftershocks followed. At least 36 people were killed in Izmir, Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD, said. Among them was an elderly woman who drowned in the tsunami. But rescue teams on Saturday made contact with 38-year old Seher Perincek and her four children — ages 3, 7 and 10-year-old twins — inside a fallen building in Izmir and cleared a corridor to bring them out. Search and rescue works continue at debris of Doganlar Apartment located in Bayrakli district after a magnitude 6.6 quake shook Turkey's Aegean Sea coast, in Izmir, Turkey on October 31, 2020.   One by one, the mother and three of her children were removed from the rubble as rescuers applauded or hugged. The survivors, including 10-year-old Elzem Perincek, were moved into ambulances on stretchers. “I’m fine; I was rescued because only one of my feet was pinned. That foot really hurt,” she said. The health minister as well as rescue worker Ahmet Yavuz told HaberTurk television hours later that one of the children had died after being rescued. They were still trying to reach the other child, Yavuz said. More than 5,500 rescuers from different agencies and cities worked together to reach survivors, at times hushing the crowds to listen into the rubble with sensitive headphones and crawling through the cracks. A 65-year-old man was saved 26 hours after the quake. Rescue work continued in nine buildings. Earlier Saturday, search-and-rescue teams lifted teenager Inci Okan out of the rubble of a devastated eight-floor apartment building. Her dog, Fistik, or Pistachio, was also rescued, Turkish media reported. A video showed a female rescuer trying to calm down the 16-year-old girl under the rubble as she inserted a catheter. “I'm so scared,” the girl cried. “Can you hold my hand?” “We are going to get out of here soon,” the rescuer, Edanur Dogan, said. “Your mother is waiting outside for you.” Two other women, aged 53 and 35, were brought out from the rubble of another toppled two-story building earlier on Saturday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Izmir and was being briefed at the crisis center. In all, around 100 people have been rescued since the earthquake, Murat Kurum, the environment and urban planning minister, told reporters. It was unclear how many more people were trapped under buildings that were leveled. AFAD said 885 people were injured in Izmir and three other provinces.

Here’s how it works. One of the victims drowned as streets flooded in what's being called a mini tsunami.  A powerful earthquake struck in the Aegean Sea earlier today (Oct. 30), causing nearly 20 buildings in Turkey's coastal city of Izmir to collapse and killing at least 14 people, including two in Greece.  Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) reported the quake was a magnitude 6.6 while the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reported a magnitude of 7.0.   Dramatic footage of the moment a building collapses in #Izmir.

No casualties reported yet, but the fear is there, as the mayor said around 20 buildings reportedly collapsed#quake #turkey pic.twitter.com/rhMLkvdnx9October 30, 2020 Footage showed flooded streets, piles of rubble where buildings once stood and buildings collapsing.  Search and rescue efforts are continuing in Izmir in the piles of rubble where buildings collapsed, according to Anadolu Agency. At least 70 people were rescued from the damaged buildings, Izmir's Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said, according to The Washington Post. The earthquake triggered a small tsunami that hit Izmir's Seferhisar district, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute said, according to AP News. At least 12 people were killed in Izmir, including one who drowned, while 438 were injured, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFA), CNN Turk reported. The quake also shook Greece, causing a wall to collapse on the nearby Greek island of Samos, killing two teenagers, according to AP News. At least 19 people were injured in Samos, according to the Post.    Aftershocks were reported in both Greece and Turkey, according to CNN.  Turkey sits upon major fault lines, making it one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, according to Reuters. In August of 1999, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit the city of Izmit, southeast of Istanbul, killing more than 17,000 people and in 2011, another quake struck Van, a city in eastern Turkey, killing over 500, according to Reuters. In the last century, 29 other earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater have struck within 155 miles (250 km) of today's earthquake, according to the USGS. Originally published on Live Science.

 Rescuers search for survivors Friday in a collapsed building in Izmir, Turkey, after a powerful earthquake struck Turkey's western coast and parts of Greece.  At least 14 people died Friday in Turkey and Greece after a powerful earthquake struck off the shore of a Greek island in the eastern Aegean Sea. Emergency crews  are working to find victims and survivors of the earthquake, which registered a magnitude 7.0, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. More than 100 aftershocks have been felt, Turkish officials said. The earthquake's worst effects are being reported in western Turkey, where officials said 12 people are dead and more than 600 are injured. At least 17 buildings were destroyed or damaged in Izmir — one of Turkey's largest cities, which was known in antiquity as Smyrna. One person died by drowning, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority. The agency said search and rescue crews are still trying to reach anyone who might be trapped or injured. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ""to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries.""  The Greek leader added, ""Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together."" The strong quake struck north of Néon Karlovásion, a small town on the Greek island of Samos. At least eight people were injured there, according to Greek state-run broadcaster ERT. But it also reported that two high school students, a boy and a girl, died in the city of Samos after a wall lining a narrow street collapsed on them.

 A strong earthquake shook parts of Turkey and Greece on Friday after striking north of the Greek island of Samos. The quake shook a broad section of western Turkey – particularly Izmir, where hundreds of thousands of people live some 40 miles from the quake's epicenter. Turkey said its military is rushing relief supplies and personnel to the area. Friday's earthquake is an ""intraplate event,"" the USGS said, resulting from the Africa plate grinding along the Eurasia tectonic plate. The earthquake, which hit roughly 155 miles north of the main boundary between those plates, is largely consistent with earlier temblors in the region, the agency said. ""While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as slip over a larger fault area,"" the USGS said. It added that a 7.0 magnitude quake would normally have a fault area of 50 by 20 kilometers — about 31 by 12 miles. Each year, the Africa plate moves northward around 10 millimeters (around 4/10 of an inch), the agency said.  This is a breaking news story. Some things reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene.

"4 killed, 120 injured in Aegean Sea earthquake",2020-10-30 13:26 UTC,https://www.kron4.com/news/u-s-world/strong-aegean-sea-earthquake-topples-buildings-in-turkey/,"KRON4 Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       ISTANBUL (AP) — A strong earthquake struck Friday in the Aegean Sea between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of Samos, collapsing buildings in the city of Izmir in western Turkey, and officials said at least six people were killed and scores were injured. A small tsunami struck the Seferisar district of Izmir, said Haluk Ozener, director of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute. At least four people were slightly injured on Samos, where a tsunami warning was issued. Six people were killed in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, including one who drowned, and 202 were injured, according to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Izmir Gov. Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people had been rescued from the wreckage. He said four buildings were destroyed and more than 10 collapsed, while others also were damaged. Search and rescue efforts were continuing in at least 12 buildings, AFAD said. Turkish media showed wreckage of a multiple-story building, with people climbing it to start rescue efforts. Smoke rose from several spots. Videos on Twitter showed flooding in the Seferhisar district, and Turkish officials and broadcasters called on people to stay off the streets after reports of traffic congestion. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted that 38 ambulances, two ambulance helicopters and 35 medical rescue teams were working in the city of Izmir. Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency said the earthquake was centered in the Aegean at a depth of 16.5 kilometers (10.3 miles) and registered at a 6.6 magnitude. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.9, with an epicenter 13 kilometers (8 miles) north northeast of the Greek island of Samos. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude at 7.0. It is common for preliminary magnitudes to differ in the early hours and days after a quake. The environment and urban planning minister, Murat Kurum, said people were trapped under the wreckage and rescue efforts were underway. Greek seismologist Akis Tselentis told Greek state broadcaster ERT that the quake was believed to be the main earthquake, but that due to the shallow depth of its epicenter — roughly 10 kilometers — potentially powerful aftershocks could be expected for several weeks, or even a month, to come. He said residents of affected areas must be careful not to enter buildings that might have been damaged in the initial quake, as they could collapse in a strong aftershock. The earthquake was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as the Greek capital, Athens, and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it was also felt across the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul’s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey’s largest. On the Greek island of Samos, damage was reported in buildings and the road network, while a tsunami warning was issued, with residents told to stay away from the coast. Water rose above the dock in the main harbor of Samos and flooded the street. Residents have also been told to stay away from buildings, as aftershocks continued to rattle the area. The Greek minister responsible for civil protection and crisis management, Nikos Hardalias, was heading to Samos, as were a search and rescue team, paramedics, and engineers. —- Becatoros reported from Athens.

Please enter a search term.       SAND POINT, Alaska (KSEE/KGPE) — A preliminary 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck near Alaska on Monday, triggering a tsunami warning. The quake struck in the North Pacific Ocean just before 1 p.m. It was centered about 67 miles (118 kilometers) southeast of Sand Point. The community is about 800 miles (1,288 km) southwest of Anchorage. The quake was recorded at a depth of 19 miles (30 kilometers). Raynelle Gardner, a secretary at Sand Point School in the Aleutians East Borough School District, said things are hectic because “this is an evacuation point.” Some schools in the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District were evacuating to higher ground, the district said on Twitter. The tsunami warning was issued by the National Tsunami Warning Center, following an earthquake off Sand Point, Alaska. The size of the quake was originally reported to have been a magnitude of 7.4, but was revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said an earthquake of this size, in this area, is not a surprise. “This is an area where the Pacific Plate is subducting underneath the North American Plate. And because of that, the Pacific Plate actually goes underneath the North American Plate, where it melts,” Caruso said, noting that’s why there are volcanoes in the region. “And so we commonly have large, magnitude 7 earthquakes in that area.” The National Weather Service posted a tsunami warning for parts of the Alaska coastline, from Kennedy Entrance, 40 miles southwest of Homer, to Unimak Pass, 80 miles northeast of Unalaska.   If you are located in this coastal area, move inland to higher ground. Tsunami warnings mean that a tsunami with significant inundation is possible or is already occurring. Tsunamis are a series of waves dangerous many hours after initial arrival time. The first wave may not be the largest. At 1255 PM Alaska Daylight Time on October 19 an earthquake with preliminary magnitude 7.5 occurred 55 miles southeast of Sand Point Alaska. Estimated tsunami start times for selected sites are; Sand Point Alaska 155 PM. AKDT. October 19. Cold Bay Alaska 245 PM. AKDT. October 19. Kodiak Alaska 250 PM. AKDT. October 19. The tsunami warning will remain in effect until further notice. Refer to the internet site tsunami.gov for more information. Unalaska officials sent out a message saying the city is just outside the warning zone and they aren’t ordering evacuations right now. Unalaska public safety officials earlier Monday had sent out a release saying they would be conducting tests of the community’s tsunami warning sirens. The center said the quake was widely felt in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula. The Alaska Earthquake Center said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. “It was a pretty good shaker here,” said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. “We’re doing OK.” He said all guests were accounted for and “the structure itself is sound.”  Rita Tungul, front desk assistant at the Grand Aleutian Hotel in Unalaska, said she felt some shaking but it wasn’t strong. Her coworker didn’t feel the quake at all, she said. Connie Newton, owner of the Bearfoot Inn, a grocery store, liquor store and small hotel in Cold Bay, said the temblor it felt like someone drove into her building with a truck. Still, nothing fell to the ground and she suffered no damage because she earthquake-proofed her stores by installing 2-inch (5-cm) risers around the outside of her selves.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

         SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) -- It lasted for less than a minute, as short as 15 seconds in some Bay Area neighborhoods, but the memories of the deadly and destructive 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake still linger. The quake claimed 63 lives, injured nearly 4,000 and caused widespread damage. It also altered the Bay Area landscape forever. Gone was the Cypress Structure on Highway 880 on Oakland, the Embarcadero and a portion of the Central Freeway.  We asked other KPIX 5 viewers for their memories of that fateful day on our Facebook and social media pages . Patrick Gonzales was a toddler living with his family in El Cerrito. ""Was 5....bottom floor of a 4 plex in El Cerrito, remember heading towards the door, looking back at my mother to say...something...slight shake nothing new, then...I have a snippet of her grasping the doorway in the kitchen and I just hit the floor,"" he posted. ""Dad just off work taking the bus the city to Alameda. Said he ""didn't feel a thing"" & ""I was wondering what everyone was doing outside ????"" ????????????."" Elizabeth Kershner was in class. ""I remember a professor shouting, ""Run for your lives!"" as everyone came out of the building,"" she posted. ""And then I remember hearing on the radio news that ""The Bay Bridge has collapsed."" At first it sounded like the whole bridge had been destroyed."" Christine Ravetti Ravely was at work when the building began to shake.  Michele Dimond was going to class at USF School of Nursing. ""At first, I thought a little trembler, no big deal but about 5 sec after that a huge jolt and the ground felt like water...watching it move through and under your feet was a trip,"" she posted. ""Then silence, the city just went silent, oddest experience."" Maggie Layton was driving home from work. ""I thought I had 4 flat tires when I realized everything was moving,"" she posted. ""Instead of taking 1/2 hour to get home it took me an hour and 1/2. Luckily I was able to stop by my old company so I could call home and let them know I was OK ????"" Kevin Allred was a youngster, excited to be at the World Series game with his family. ""Ironically enough I was only nine years old and was a kid back then,"" he posted. ""My parents and myself were in San Fran at Candlestick in the car. I was trying to get out of the car then a big jolt hit like someone bumped me from behind. I first it was my brother Keith but my father said ""we had an earthquake"" and I panicked. It was scary."" Becky Gardner Kutler Schlueter was also about to leave work. ""Just about ready to leave the office for the day in San Bruno,"" she posted. ""It took a few seconds to realize what was happening and then evacuated the building as soon as it stopped shaking. I remember seeing the windows of the much taller building across the street bowing in and out. I was relatively new to the Bay Area and didn't yet know even where the Cypress Structure was but could not believe the devastation I was finally able to see on TV. Not too many years later I was driving regularly on 880 and crossing the Bay Bridge and often thought about what I'd do if another big one hit Pat Leal lived at the time in the East Bay. She huddled with her husband and little granddaughter, hoping the shaking would stop. ""Lived in San Leandro and had just got home from work,"" she posted. ""My husband my little granddaughter Jacque and I just stood still and I kept saying 'Oh my God' over and over until it stopped. No power for hours. No damaged to our house."" Lesli Fullerton-Pacis was a student at San Francisco State. ""Had just stepped out of the psych building heading across the street to catch the M,"" she said. ""Being outside on a loud corner, I felt the earthquake, but not as much as if I'd been inside. My first clue that it was serious was when the Muni stopped moving. I still didn't know how bad it was until after I had walked from SFSU to my home in Diamond Heights and my mother told me."" Scott Kinkel endured a few moments of embarrassment during his hurried escape into the street.  ""It was still shaking and the water was splashing a couple feet above the community pool across the street,"" he added. ""When it was all over, Yep, that was me, the wet guy in a too small pink robe in the middle of the street."" Lorene La Centra-Templeton posted that fate saved her from the destruction on the Cypress Structure.  Larry Pasion was studying inside the Fremont Main Library. ""(I was) studying before the World Series on the top floor next to the window at the then new Fremont Main Library,"" he posted. ""Felt the initial shake & didn't think anything of it. Then the next few seconds after, everyone took cover. I went under the table and once the shaking stop I got up to look outside only to feel the whole library sway side to side. The library was built on rollers. Didn't realize the effect or the size of the earthquake until I notice the double decker bridge in Oakland had collapsed....still remember it to this day."" Candi Nissim was at a BBQ she will never forget and the friend she lost on that day. ""BBQing burgers to watch the World Series with our neighbors in Concord."" she posted. ""My husband had left work in the City early and was already home (thank goodness). The earthquake hit and when things quieted down we watched in horror the damage it had cause. We watch the rescue efforts in the City of a home collapsed and on fire. It was a dear friend of ours who was trapped in that home and who died in it. There is no words for the anguish and helplessness we felt.""  Dee.Es.Malo remember the fear that gripped her 8-year-old body. ""Running downstairs in our town house in Newark,"" she posted on the KPIX 5 Instagram page.  ""I was bouncing of the walls all the way down! Dad was coming home off the Dumbarton. It took hours for him to get home. Never been more scared in my 8-year-old life."" Taylor tweeted on the  Twitter Page  that a large wave came out of the family pool. ""I was at home in Santa Clara, and watched a wave of pool water come up above the seven foot fence,"" he tweeted. ""And somehow the sandwich I was eating got thrown across the room."" Kaji tweeted about the terrifying moments in the kitchen. ""I was cooking in the kitchen,"" Kaji tweeted. ""The cabinet doors were opened by shake, all of dishes slided down and crushed one by one on the floor. All of furniture were dancing, A big TV jumped down on the floor. I couldn't forget the day in San Francisco. I was lucky that I could survive it.""   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved."

(Photo by Ned Rozell)  A few nights ago, stretched in a tent on the blue-gray gravel of the Lowe River floodplain, I woke to a series of sharp jolts. It felt like the earth was a giant halibut, and I was the fishing pole. Earthquake! The ratcheting westward lasted only a few seconds, but I felt the helplessness every human does when solid ground is no longer the truth. My first thought was of the day before, when I had walked through the open marsh grasses at the site of Old Valdez. I could still see some of the streets and concrete foundations of the former town, not far from where I later pitched my tent. During the Great Alaska Earthquake of March 1964, water-saturated soils beneath Old Valdez become more liquid than solid — they underwent liquefaction — during shaking that lasted for more than four minutes. That earthly violence caused mountains of sediments beneath the ocean’s surface to slide to the depths. The moving soil shoved mountains of water out of the way, generating a great wave. At least 30 feet high, the wall of water hit Old Valdez, rebounded off rocks across the port, and nailed the town again. Thirty-two people died there, the highest death toll for any town due to the magnitude 9.2 earthquake. A few months later, geologists recommended that Valdez be rebuilt upon bedrock a few miles west near Mineral Creek. The townspeople agreed, and that is where Valdez sits today. Pilings from a wharf at the former town of Valdez that waves destroyed after the Great Alaska Earthquake of March 1964. (Photo by Ned Rozell)  As for the earthquake I felt, my email subscription to Alaska Earthquake Center informed me it was a magnitude 4.1. The epicenter was 24 miles north of Valdez, about 15 miles underground, beneath a mountain divide. I asked Geophysical Institute seismologist Carl Tape if he could describe the precise ratcheting I felt. He said the shocks were messier than that, “related to waves scattering all throughout this complex earth — and also traveling at different speeds.” That release of energy from two stressed hunks of planet probably lasted just one second, he said. It was an instant that people in Valdez talked about as they met later that day. On the trip to Valdez, as on other trips around Alaska in summer 2020, my windshield became crispy with insect carcasses. Alaska insects, like those all over North America, have not shown signs of a recent decrease. (Photo by Ned Rozell)   “North American insects are not showing signs of decline,” Sikes wrote back. He attached a paper, published just a few days before in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution. In the study, a dozen scientists had looked at records of insect abundance at U.S. Long Term Ecological Research sites, including a few in Alaska. “Recent reports of dramatic declines in insect abundance suggest grave consequences for global ecosystems and human society,” the researchers wrote, citing insects' roles as plant pollinators. “Most evidence comes from Europe, however.” Alaska insects, like those all over North America, have not shown signs of a recent decrease. (Photo by Ned Rozell)  The scientists found insect populations of North America were pretty much stable, and concluded with a sentence Alaskans might recall when we hear the whine of tiny wings. “The apparent robustness of U.S. arthropod populations is reassuring.” [Because of a high volume of comments requiring moderation, we are temporarily disabling comments on many of our articles so editors can focus on the coronavirus crisis and other coverage.

"Wee earthquake, one of many, wiggles French Gulch Friday morning",2020-08-28 20:24 UTC,https://www.redding.com/story/news/2020/08/28/wee-earthquake-wiggles-french-gulch-friday-morning/5657727002/," Geologists reported a small earthquake shook an area west of Redding on Friday morning.  While 2.4 is a bit stronger than most North State earthquakes, it's considered quite small, according to USGS earthquake geologist Alex Hatem.  Wee quakes are common in the North State, she said. ""You (Shasta and Siskiyou counties) are in a volcanic area, which can be prone to having small earthquakes."" According to the USGS, there have been about a dozen tremors recorded by the USGS since Aug. 11 in the area stretching from Red Bluff to Mount Shasta and from Hayfork to Lassen Peak. Other than the one recorded near French Gulch, none had a magnitude over 1.8.  A 2.4 earthquake is usually hard to feel unless you are in bed close to the epicenter, being very still, Hatem said. ""Walking around, you probably would not have felt it."" A post on Facebook asked if anyone felt the earthquake. As of 11 a.m. Friday, no one reported knowing it had happened. The USGS recommends people get under a table and cover their head if they feel an earthquake, Hatem said.  This week, the USGS launched a Twitter account for people to track earthquakes, said Paul Laustsen, public affairs specialist at the USGS’ Earthquake Science Center. Go to @USGS_Quakes to follow.

There were no reports of serious injuries, but some minor structural damage was reported in Sparta, as well as cracks in roads.  The University of Memphis’ Center for Earthquake Research and Information, with help from North Carolina and U.S. geological survey officials, has deployed four portable seismograph stations in a tightly controlled pattern to record aftershocks of the earthquake.  Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     In Other News Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings."
There was a 'boomerang earthquake' in 2016. Here's what that means,2020-08-12 13:00 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2020/8/12/21363312/boomerang-earthquake-atlantic-ocean,"A ‘boomerang earthquake’ hit the Atlantic Ocean. Here’s what it means Adobe Stock  Earthquakes can apparently turn around and hit an area with a second pass — an event known as a “boomerang earthquake” — in rare circumstances.  Scientists recently found evidence of the “boomerang earthquake” in a new study, highlighting an event that happened in the Atlantic Ocean back in 2016. The earthquake — which took place at the Romanche fracture zone — happened between Brazil and the west coast of Africa. There was a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in August 2016. The tremor traveled one direction and then it came back around for a second strike, bringing an increase of speed on the second strike, according to ScienceAlert. Or, described another way, “the rupture initially spreads away from initial break but then turns and runs back the other way at higher speeds,” according to Phys.org. “Whilst scientists have found that such a reversing rupture mechanism is possible from theoretical models, our new study provides some of the clearest evidence for this enigmatic mechanism occurring in a real fault,” said Stephen Hicks, lead researcher and seismologist from Imperial College London.  “Even though the fault structure seems simple, the way the earthquake grew was not, and this was completely opposite to how we expected the earthquake to look before we started to analyze the data.” The earthquake had two phases. The first traveled eastward before coming back around and going westward.  This, of course, is the first reported incident of a boomerang earthquake. It’s so rare that it’s unlikely to find one again unless researchers seek it out, according to National Geographic. Evidence is growing of these events. But more research is needed to discover more. “The theory says that it’s there, but it’s quite difficult to see that (in the real world),” said geophysicist Louisa Brotherson, a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Liverpool in the U.K., who simulates earthquakes.

Do you need earthquake insurance?,2020-08-11 14:23 UTC,https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/local/earthquake-insurance-is-a-thing-in-nc-why-you-cant-buy-it-right-now/83-673947b6-c5ae-4bfc-880b-338ab2f5cfb2,"Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     GREENSBORO, N.C. — “We started last week with a hurricane and we ended the week with an earthquake. I don't think people have a clue as to what is not in their insurance policy,” said Christopher Cook with Alliance Insurance Services. What is not in your standard homeowners insurance policy? Flooding, earthquake damage, and wind damage. For example, damage from Sunday’s earthquake would not be covered unless the homeowner had earthquake coverage. Most folks don’t have this extra coverage. Cook says only two of his 4,000 customers have earthquake coverage. And right now, even if you had the money to buy coverage, you can’t get it. “We've already had companies come out to us and say do not issue insurance for seven days, they need to see what is going to happen before there are policies issued. Then there is a two-week waiting period before we do that. You have to be cognizant that if the ground is still shaking, companies aren't going to let you add coverage,"" added Cook.   Cook says it's worth having your insurance agent run the numbers for you-- so you can decide if you think the risk is worth it. Much like earthquake insurance, you can’t get flood insurance right before a storm is coming. Christopher Cook said, ""I get this question all the time, it starts like, ‘Hey there is a massive storm in the Bahamas and it looks like it is coming to us. I need to add flood insurance’. My answer is, ‘I'll be happy to add flood insurance for you, today is August 10, you'll have coverage September 11’.” There is a 30 day waiting period for flood coverage to go into effect. Even if you don’t think you need earthquake or flood coverage, if you haven't really looked at it in a couple of years, you should and ask your insurance agent questions, because you might think you're covered when you're not. “Insurance pays for things that were sudden and accidental by nature but if you've had a leak in your shower for five years and now you have mold in your wall and your subfloor is collapsing into your crawl space, that happened over a long, long, long period of time, it wasn’t sudden and accidental, your insurance company is not going to pay for it,"" said Cook.  Your hot water heater isn’t working anymore. Doesn’t your policy pay for that? Christopher Cook explained a common misconception. “Something that is common that people reach out to us about is maintenance items. If your hot water heater is 20 years old and it fails, it was built to last 20 years. It's part of homeownership, it stinks but your insurance doesn’t cover mechanical failures of systems in your home.” Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings."
Sunday's Bible reading described a powerful earthquake. Then the ground shook in NC,2020-08-11 02:50 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/10/sundays-bible-reading-described-powerful-earthquake-then-ground-shook-nc/,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - It was time for the first reading at Sunday’s 8 a.m. outdoor Mass that St. Gabriel Catholic Church in Charlotte has been holding during the pandemic.  After the wind there was an earthquake — but the LORD was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake there was fire — but the LORD was not in the fire. After the fire there was a tiny whispering sound. Father Richard Sutter, pastor at St. Gabriel near SouthPark, said as the reader got to the earthquake verses, several attendees felt the ground shake.  While he didn’t feel it himself, Sutter said parishioners came up to him as soon as the service ended. Some may call it a coincidence — or “God-incidence” as Sutter put it — but the priest said the jarring moment can be a lesson for this time. “When there’s fear from an earthquake, when there’s fear from a storm, when there’s fear from a pandemic and uncertainty... you have to let the Lord speak to us the truth,” he said. In fact, Catholics around the globe read the same passage from 1 Kings that weekend, planned well in advance of Sunday’s quake. ‘A GOOD MESSAGE’ Closer to the epicenter, Father Cory Catron was preparing for another Sunday of services since becoming pastor for churches in Sparta and nearby Jefferson in late July. He was in Jefferson, about 25 miles from Sparta, when the church doors and windows shook. It made for “good homily material,” he said with a laugh, the levity possible because the church was unscathed and parishioners reported only minor property damage.  “The ceiling creaked for like three seconds, and everybody kind of looked up and immediately we knew what it was,” he said. Catron said the timely passage from scripture teaches that in this time of pandemics, financial worry and natural disasters, to slow down. “God is found in the stillness and God is found in the silence,” he said. “We have to cultivate that silence, which is a very difficult thing to do. “It’s a good message that it doesn’t matter how how strange and messed up and scary everything can be, that God is still present to us.” Copyright 2020 The Charlotte Observer.

There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Michael Hull was standing in his driveway at his home in Sparta when he noticed a group of deer running. “Not even a minute passed and the side-to-side motion started,” Hull said. “It takes you a minute to realize what’s happening, and you just can’t believe it.

My neighbors on the other hand said they felt our apartment building shaking,” Backer said. “Well, sadly, nothing surprises me in 2020, but a hurricane and an earthquake in the same week is crazy.” It was the largest earthquake to hit the state since 1916, when a magnitude 5.5 quake occurred near Skyland, the weather service said. The U.S. Geological Service said the quake’s epicenter was about 2.5 miles (four kilometers) southeast of Sparta, just south of the Virginia-North Carolina border. The USGS said the population in the affected region resides in structures “that are resistant to earthquake shaking, though vulnerable structures exist.” The quake was felt in nearby states including Virginia, South Carolina and Tennessee.

"Powerful earthquake jolts parts of Alaska, leads to tsunami warning",2020-07-22 16:27 UTC,https://fox59.com/news/national-world/powerful-earthquake-jolts-parts-of-alaska-leads-to-tsunami-warning/,"Fox 59 Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.     ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A powerful earthquake off Alaska’s southern coast jolted coastal communities late Tuesday, and some residents briefly scrambled for higher ground over fears of a tsunami. There were no immediate reports of damage in the sparsely populated area of the state, and the tsunami warning was canceled after the magnitude 7.8 quake off the Alaska Peninsula produced a wave of a less than a foot.  Because of the temblor’s location, nearby communities along the Alaska Peninsula did not experience shaking that would normally be associated with that magnitude of a quake, said Michael West, Alaska State Seismologist. That doesn’t mean they slept through it, West said residents in small towns within a hundred miles (160 kilometers) of the quake reported very strong shaking. Some shaking was also felt more than 500 miles (805 kilometers) away in the Anchorage area, West said. “No reports of any damage,” Kodiak Police Sgt. Mike Sorter said early Wednesday morning. “No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal.” Kodiak is about 200 miles (320 kilometers) northeast of where the earthquake was centered. The tsunami warning prompted coastal residents to evacuate to higher ground, with social media posts showing long lines of people fleeing towns like Homer and Kodiak as tsunami sirens wailed in the background. On Kodiak Island, the local high school and Catholic opened their doors for evacuees, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “We’ve got a high school full of people,” said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. “I’ve been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,” he told the Daily News. “Everything’s as calm as can be. We’ve got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,” he said before the warning was canceled. Tsunami warnings are commonplace for people who grew up in Kodiak. ”I’ve been doing these since I was a little kid,” LeDoux told the newspaper. “Old news.” Officials at the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, began calling off tsunami advisories and warnings after a wave of less than 1 foot (30 centimeters) was recorded in the community of Sand Point. “I might have expected a little bit more water, but I’m happy that there wasn’t,” said David Hale, the senior duty scientist at the tsunami center. Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that caused damage in the Anchorage area in November 2018. “This earthquake released about 15 times as much energy as that earthquake, said West, the state seismologist. More than a dozen aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or higher were reported immediately after the earthquake, he said from the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ”We got people here who are going be working all night,” West said early Wednesday morning. ”These aftershocks will go and go and go and go.” The Alaska-Aleutian Trench was also where a magnitude 9.2 quake in 1964 was centered. That remains the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded. The temblor and ensuing tsunami caused widespread damage and killed 131 people, some as far away as Oregon and California. Alaska is the most actively seismic state. Nearly 25,000 earthquakes have been recorded in Alaska since Jan. 1, according to the center.

On Kodiak Island, the local high school opened its doors for evacuees, as did the local Catholic school, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “We’ve got a high school full of people,” said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. “I’ve been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,” he told the Daily News. “Everything’s as calm as can be. We’ve got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,” he said before the warning was canceled. Tsunami warnings are commonplace for people who grew up in Kodiak. ”I’ve been doing these since I was a little kid,” LeDoux told the newspaper. “Old news.” Officials at the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, began calling off tsunami advisories and warnings after a wave of only 25 centimeters (.8 foot) was recorded in the community of Sand Point. “I might have expected a little bit more water, but I’m happy that there wasn’t,” said David Hale, the senior duty scientist at the tsunami center. Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that caused damage in the Anchorage area in November 2018. “This earthquake released about 15 times as much energy as that earthquake, said West, the state seismologist. More than a dozen aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or higher were reported immediately after the earthquake, he said by telephone from the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ”We got people here who are going be working all night,” West said early Wednesday morning. ”These aftershocks will go and go and go and go.” The Alaska-Aleutian Trench was also where a magnitude 9.2 quake in 1964 was centered. That remains the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded. The temblor and ensuing tsunami caused widespread damage and killed 131 people, some as far away as Oregon and California. Alaska is the most actively seismic state. Nearly 25,000 earthquakes have been recorded in Alaska since Jan. 1, according to the center.

Powerful magnitude 7.8 earthquake strikes off of Alaska,2020-07-22 13:07 UTC,https://www.fox29.com/news/powerful-magnitude-7-8-earthquake-strikes-off-of-alaska,"Share  ANCHORAGE, Alaska - A powerful earthquake struck off of Alaska's southern coast jolted some coastal communities late Tuesday, and some residents briefly scrambled for higher ground over fears of a tsunami. There were no immediate reports of damage in the sparsely populated area of the state, and a tsunami warning was canceled after the magnitude 7.8 quake off the Alaska Peninsula produced a wave of less than a foot.  Because of its location, nearby communities along the Alaska Peninsula did not experience shaking that would normally be associated with that magnitude of a quake, said Michael West, Alaska State Seismologist.

Because of its location, nearby communities along the Alaska Peninsula did not experience shaking that would normally be associated with that magnitude of a quake, said Michael West, Alaska State Seismologist.

Mike Sorter told The Associated Press early Wednesday morning. “No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal.” Kodiak is about 200 miles northeast of where the earthquake was centered. The tsunami warning had coastal residents evacuating for higher ground. Social media posts showed long lines of people fleeing towns like Homer and Kodiak while tsunami sirens wailed in the background. On Kodiak Island, the local high school opened its doors for evacuees, as did the local Catholic school, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “We’ve got a high school full of people,” said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. “I’ve been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,” he told the Daily News. “Everything’s as calm as can be. We’ve got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,” he said before the warning was canceled. Tsunami warnings are commonplace for people who grew up in Kodiak. ”I’ve been doing these since I was a little kid,” LeDoux told the newspaper. “Old news.” Officials at the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, began calling off tsunami advisories and warnings after a wave of only 25 centimeters (.8 foot) was recorded in the community of Sand Point. “I might have expected a little bit more water, but I’m happy that there wasn’t,” said David Hale, the senior duty scientist at the tsunami center. Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that caused damage in the Anchorage area in November 2018. “This earthquake released about 15 times as much energy as that earthquake, said West, the state seismologist.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska — A powerful earthquake off Alaska’s southern coast jolted coastal communities late Tuesday, and some residents briefly scrambled for higher ground over fears of a tsunami. There were no immediate reports of damage in the sparsely populated area of the state, and the tsunami warning was canceled after the magnitude 7.8 quake off the Alaska Peninsula produced a wave of a less than a foot.  Because of the temblor’s location, nearby communities along the Alaska Peninsula did not experience shaking that would normally be associated with that magnitude of a quake, said Michael West, Alaska State Seismologist. That doesn’t mean they slept through it, West said residents in small towns within a hundred miles (160 kilometers) of the quake reported very strong shaking. Some shaking was also felt more than 500 miles (805 kilometers) away in the Anchorage area, West said. “No reports of any damage,” Kodiak Police Sgt. Mike Sorter said early Wednesday morning. “No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal.” Kodiak is about 200 miles (320 kilometers) northeast of where the earthquake was centered.

Strong earthquake prompts tsunami warning from Alaska Peninsula to western Kenai,2020-07-22 07:17 UTC,https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2020/07/21/strong-earthquake-prompts-tsunami-warning-from-alaska-peninsula-to-western-kenai/,"  The tsunami warning originally stretched from the Alaska Peninsula to Kodiak Island and the western Kenai Peninsula, sending Alaskans scrambling to higher ground in communities such as Kodiak, Sand Point, Unalaska and Homer. Though some people in Anchorage received tsunami warning alerts, the Anchorage area was not at risk, said Louise Fode, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service. In its notice of the tsunami warning cancellation, the National Tsunami Warning Center said that “a tsunami was generated by this event, but no longer poses a threat. Some areas may continue to see small sea level changes.” The center also urged people not to return to hazard zones until local officials say it is safe to do so. James Gridley, director of the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, said in an interview early Wednesday that “our procedures put us into a warning even if we haven’t measured a tsunami wave — we imply that there is until we know better.”   “This is a very significant earthquake in size,” said Michael West, state seismologist with the Alaska Earthquake Center. The Tuesday night earthquake was “something like 15 times more energy than was released in the 2018 Anchorage earthquake,” he said. But since it happened offshore, there was much less shaking recorded, and West said earthquake center officials weren’t expecting damage from shaking. The kind of earthquake that occurred Tuesday evening was typical for the southern coast of Alaska, West said. It’s also the same style — “more or less,” West said — as the Great Alaska Earthquake of 1964. “These are the style of earthquakes which can be very tsunami-producing,” West said.

(Larry LeDoux photo)  In Kodiak, tsunami warning sirens sounded Tuesday night and residents headed to high ground. Kodiak High School opened its doors for evacuees, as did the local Catholic school. At Coast Guard base Kodiak, residents were instructed to head to Aviation Hill, high ground overlooking the nearby airport. The local public radio station reminded evacuees to carry masks. “We’ve got a high school full of people. I’ve been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,” said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. ”Everything’s as calm as can be. We’ve got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,” he said.  At Kodiak High School, LeDoux said the sirens and evacuations were nothing out of the ordinary for someone who grew up in Kodiak. ”I’ve been doing these since I was a little kid,” he said. “Old news.” In the first minutes of a seismic event, there aren’t usually enough ocean sensors to measure a tsunami wave, said Gridley with the National Tsunami Warning Center. You have to give it time to get to nearby sensors, he said, but if there’s a wave, beaches and shorelines could be impacted before then. “We have to assume the worst case scenario,” Gridley said. “The safest position is to get people moving.” It’s not like a hurricane that forms out in the ocean, days away from shore, he said — they have to go straight to a warning.

(Megan Pacer/Homer Tribune via AP)  On Tuesday, the center issued its tsunami warning and kept the warning in place after seeing a 25-centimeter wave in Sand Point. Center officials knew the tsunami wouldn’t be huge, Gridley said, but they had to be certain and wait for the entire wave cycle. “If we just start seeing a little bump, we don’t know if that bump is going to get much bigger, or if that was it,” Gridley said. After about an hour and a half Tuesday, the tsunami advisories for certain areas outside of the warning zones were canceled, Gridley said. “We just had to wait long enough to see whether or not we would see more of a wave develop or not,” Gridley said. “And the answer was no.” The center canceled the tsunami warning, which grew to stretch from the Aleutian Islands to the Western Kenai, a little under two hours after it issued its initial warning. Unalaska City Manager Erin Reinders said the city activated its emergency operations center Tuesday night and notified the community to evacuate areas below 50 feet to higher ground, before later issuing the all-clear. ”We were in a (city) council meeting and started feeling it rocking, and by the time I got home from the council meeting then the warnings were going and had to turn back around,” Reinders said.  ”This is a developing situation, and we are monitoring closely the information that is coming from the state and federal agencies that we’re collaborating with,” Ahlberg said before the tsunami warning was canceled. “So at this juncture, I’m not putting a time stamp on it.” In Homer, sirens blared late Tuesday night, alerting residents to the tsunami threat.

(Tom Kizzia video)  According to Homer Deputy City Clerk and Deputy Public Information Officer Rachel Tussey, Homer residents were told to evacuate areas below 50 feet, and the city stood up an emergency operations center at the Homer Volunteer Fire Department. Tussey said the Homer High School was set up as an assembly point and emergency shelter.  “The first wave didn’t materialize, which is a great thing,” said Keeler, who had been in close contact with public safety staff in Sand Point since the earthquake.

(Sand Point Department of Public Safety)  The earthquake was felt in Sand Point, but there were no reports of major structural damage, Keeler said. A commercial fishing opener starting at 6 a.m. Wednesday means much of the substantial Sand Point fishing fleet has left the harbor for the fishing grounds, Keeler said.   “A rapidly receding or receded shoreline, unusual waves and sounds, and strong currents are signs of a tsunami,” the center said. “The tsunami may appear as water moving rapidly out to sea, a gentle rising tide like flood with no breaking wave, as a series of breaking waves, or a frothy wall of water.” For the latest tsunami information, visit tsunami.gov.

     Seismologist warns the event isn't over and it's possible there could be even a stronger earthquake on the way; Jeff Paul reports. Scientists have warned that last year’s Ridgecrest quakes in Southern California have increased the risk of a major San Andreas Fault earthquake. The quakes, warn catastrophe modeling company Temblor, have placed stress on the Garlock Fault that links the Ridgecrest Faults with the San Andreas Fault. In a blog post, Temblor CEO Ross Stein and Shinji Toda of Tohoku University explained that if the Garlock Fault ruptured in a large shock, “it would likely trigger a San Andreas earthquake north of Los Angeles.” A paper on the research has been published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America. MAJOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FAULT LINE EYED AFTER STUDY SHOWS UNPRECEDENTED MOVEMENT “In our study, we developed a new method to forecast future seismicity,” Stein and Toda wrote in the post. “These forecasts are not earthquake predictions, which have so far proven impossible. Rather, they are probabilistic, framed in the language of chance. We use past seismicity, the stress imparted by recent large and moderate earthquakes and the equations governing how fault friction varies in time and space (‘rate-state friction’) to estimate the likelihood of future earthquakes of different sizes.” The 9.3-mile deep San Andreas Fault in California is one of the longest and most active in the world. This computer-generated image is enhanced to show its features - illustration. (SRTM, JPL, NASA) The experts used machine learning technology in their analysis, which estimates a 2.3 percent chance of a magnitude-7.7 Garlock Fault rupture in the next year. “This is 100 times higher than its annual chances in the ‘UCERF3’ benchmark model for California, which is jointly issued by the [U.S. Geological Survey], the Southern California Earthquake Center, and the California Geological Survey,” Stein and Toda wrote. The scientists calculate that if the Garlock Fault ruptured to within about 30 miles of its junction with the San Andreas Fault, “it would raise the probability of a San Andreas rupture extending to the southeast, on the so-called ‘Mojave section,’ by a factor of about 150.”  “That translates into a 50/50 chance of a San Andreas Mojave section rupture (with a range, 25 percent-67 percent), either immediately following a Garlock quake, or after some delay,” they added. Part of the visible section of the San Andreas Fault. (AP) Set against this backdrop, they estimate that the net chance of a large San Andreas earthquake in the next 12 months is 1.15 percent. “While small, this probability is 3.5-5.0 times higher than the annual chance of a large San Andreas earthquake in the ‘UCERF3’ benchmark model for California,” they added. Given the small likelihood of a large San Andreas earthquake in the next year, the scientists say no one should panic. “But, as we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, low probability chain-reaction events do occur in nature, and when they do, their consequences can be great,” they explained. “It is the responsibility of scientists to assess the likelihood of such events, and then to bring them to the attention of the public and decision-makers.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Seismologist Lucy Jones, who was not involved in the study, described the analysis as “elegant” in a tweet, but added that it “assumes a reason for quake triggering that is not consensus.” “The possibility of a San Andreas quake AT ANY TIME should already be part of your planning or you shouldn't be in California,” she wrote, in another tweet.

"Powerful earthquake shakes southern Mexico, at least 4 dead",2020-06-24 01:06 UTC,https://www.krgv.com/news/powerful-earthquake-shakes-southern-mexico-at-least-4-dead,"By MARÍA VERZA and CHRISTOPHER SHERMAN Associated Press MEXICO CITY (AP) — A powerful earthquake centered near the southern Mexico resort of Huatulco killed at least four people, swayed buildings in Mexico City and sent thousands fleeing into the streets. Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed and another injured in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise he said reports were of minor damage from the magnitude 7.4 quake, including broken windows and collapsed walls. Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat later said a second person was killed in an apparent house collapse in the tiny mountain village of San Juan Ozolotepec.  Pemex also said the quake caused a fire at its refinery in the Pacific coast city of Salina Cruz, relatively near the epicenter. It said one worker was injured and the flames were quickly extinguished. Churches, bridges and highways also suffered damage during the quake. López Obrador said there had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out to some areas. Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Inside a Mexico City military barracks converted to COVID-19 hospital, medical staff suited in protective equipment tried to calm anxious patients. Unable to evacuate isolation areas, patients huddled under a large beam in the women’s ward while a nurse tried to calm one having a panic attack. Teresa Juárez could only wish for it to pass quickly from her hospital bed where she lay connected to oxygen. Diabetic and with high blood pressure, Juárez said she thought about her five children. “It’s horrible, you’re here and you don’t know what to do,” she said.  It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico. In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued. “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves three to 10 feet above tide levels along parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru and Ecuador. Guatemala’s national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea. __ Associated Press writers Chris Torchia in Mexico City and Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.

7.4 magnitude earthquake hits southern Mexico,2020-06-23 21:29 UTC,https://kfor.com/news/7-4-magnitude-earthquake-hits-southern-mexico/,"KFOR.com Oklahoma City Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term. A 7.4 magnitude earthquake occurred June 23, 2020 along the southern coastline of Mexico.   A 7.4 magnitude earthquake occurred June 23, 2020 along the southern coastline of Mexico.   MEXICO (CNN) — At least two people have died after a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Mexico’s southern coastline on Tuesday, collapsing buildings and prompting evacuations.  Oaxaca’s state governor Alejandro Murat said a 22-year-old woman and a man were among the dead. The Oaxacan Health Services also reported damages from the quake to general hospitals in Pochutla, Puerto Escondido and Pinotepa Nacional and a few community hospitals in other areas. According to Murat, two of the hospitals with damages have been dealing with coronavirus patients. “We are verifying [damages] because this hospital is also tending Covid cases on the Oaxacan coast,” he said on a radio interview with Radio Fórmula. The severity of the damages are not specified. Mexico’s National Coordination of Civil Protection reported the first death after a structure collapsed after the earthquake, which occurred just east of the popular tourist destination Huatulco. Authorities also reported a power outage throughout the state’s capital and damages to the exterior of a hospital in Oaxaca. The earthquake could be felt as far as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. In capital Mexico City, approximately 190 miles north of the epicenter, tremors were felt and sirens were heard wailing. Tsunami waves of 0.68 meters (2.2 ft) were observed in Acapulco and 0.71 meters (2.3 ft) in Salina Cru. An earlier tsunami warning was revised down, according to the US Tsunami Warning System, forecasting possible waves of up to a meter (3.3 ft). The damage in Oaxaca state is considered light to moderate, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS) ShakeMap. Estimates modeled by the USGS suggest that localized casualties and damage are possible but there are likely to be fewer than 100 fatalities and less than $100 million in damage. However, the model only includes earthquake shaking, and not any impacts from potential tsunamis on the coastline. The USGS said that recent earthquakes in the area have caused secondary hazards such as tsunamis and landslides. Earlier estimates put the magnitude of the earthquake at 7.7, but that has been revised down to 7.4 (and additional revisions are possible). Mexico is one of the world’s most seismically active regions and has a long history of devastating earthquakes. The country is located on top of three large tectonic plates and their movement causes regular quakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. In 2017, two powerful earthquakes hit the country in two weeks, toppling buildings, cracking highways and killing hundreds of people. One had a magnitude of 7.1 and the other a magnitude of 8.1. Mexico City is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes because its very soft and wet ground amplifies shaking and is prone to liquefaction, in which dirt transforms into a dense liquid when sufficiently churned.

In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued. “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. #Oaxaca #Mexico after strong 7.4 #earthquake #Terremoto #Temblor #Sismo 🚨 pic.twitter.com/Jr8LSEXXkg

"Solving the virus and earthquake, Magna-style",2020-05-10 20:28 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/5/10/21252062/lee-benson-solving-coronavirus-earthquake-magna-style-pandemic-covid-19-disasters,"Brandis Touhuni stands in front of the pet-grooming business she owns on Magna Main Street. The March 18, 2020, earthquake shut her business down for just three days. Lee Benson,&nbsp;Deseret News  MAGNA — Want to see resilience? Want to see getting right back up after taking a punch? Want to see not waiting for the government to take care of it for you? You could do worse than walk into Aunt Ernie’s Pet Parlor on Magna’s Main Street and talk to Brandis Touhuni. Brandis, 39, owns Aunt Ernie’s, a dog grooming business (the name pays tribute to the grooming skills of Brandis’ mother, Ernestine) that is located near the west end of Main below the big “C” on the mountain — for Cyprus High School — and the beginning of the Kennecott Copper property that for over 100 years has defined the town. Magna started out, and remains, a miner’s town, a hard-working, no-nonsense, get the shift done and then hope for a little overtime kind of place. A pandemic and earthquake do not appear to have changed that. It’s been almost two months since Magna got its chamber of commerce nightmare. First, on March 11, came the coronavirus pandemic. Second, on March 18, came a 5.7 earthquake, the epicenter less than 4 miles northeast of downtown Magna and its century-old buildings. While damage was reported throughout the Salt Lake Valley, Magna got the worst of it. What’s transpired ever since, in Brandis’ view from west Main, has been vintage Magna. “People have come together. There’s a small-town feel here you’re not going to find a lot of other places,” she says. “Everyone’s always helping each other.” She uses herself as exhibit one. This 104-year-old building on Magna Main Street owned by James and Brandis Touhuni suffered extensive damage in the March 18, 2020, earthquake. Brandis Touhuni Brandis Touhuni works behind the counter of Aunt Ernie’s, the pet grooming business she owns on Magna’s Main Street. Lee Benson, Deseret News This 104-year-old building on Magna Main Street owned by James and Brandis Touhuni suffered extensive damage in the March 18, 2020, earthquake. Lee Benson, Deseret News  But then they got in the car to check on the two 104-year-old buildings they own on Main Street. (Both buildings, by the way, were used in the Disney TV show “Andi Mack” when it was filmed on location in Magna. Aunt Ernie’s was the Spoon Diner and the building next door was a record shop). The Aunt Ernie’s building had some cracks in the interior that didn’t appear to be too serious, but the building next door was in shambles, with bricks littered everywhere, facing major repair. Like most everyone else in Magna, the Touhuni’s didn’t have earthquake insurance. So what did they do? Call a lawyer and take out bankruptcy? Sit down and cry? Nope. They started rebuilding immediately. And their neighbors immediately pitched in to help. “We had three separate fundraisers for us before we knew it,” says Brandis. “We got help from people we didn’t even know.” The response was welcome, but it wasn’t unexpected. It’s why Brandis and James live in Magna. They both grew up here, both went to Cyprus High, both have Magna in their veins. “It’s a good town, a really good place to live,” says Brandis. “It doesn’t always have the best of reputations. It’s a low-income area, so you’ve got some drug problems and some things like that. But the majority are just good, solid blue-collar people who would do anything for you. Maybe they ended up here on the west side because it’s what they could afford — but they stay because they want to. “I mean we’re tough out here. We’ve all had to work and bust our butts for what we have and I don’t think anybody’s willing to just give it up. There’s not a business owner down here that’s not willing to fight for what they’ve put their heart and soul into.” Bureaucratic restrictions and red tape that are part and parcel of pandemics and earthquakes have just been additional hurdles to clear. “They (the government) have done nothing but make it more difficult,” says Brandis. “The hoops we’ve had to jump through with Salt Lake County have been ridiculous.” As an example, after the earthquake the county turned off the gas to all the buildings. It was a safety measure and completely understandable. The problem was, no one from the county returned to turn the gas back on, and the gas company wouldn’t do it because it didn’t turn it off. “So we took a wrench and turned ours back on ourselves,” says Brandis. “The other businesses were like, ‘How did you get your gas back on?’ And we’re like, ‘With a wrench,’ and they’re like, ‘We’re going to do that, too.’ And we all high-fived.” Problem-solving, Magna style. All in all, the pandemic and earthquake ended up shutting down Brandis’ dog grooming business for a grand total of three days. They’ve had to practice social distancing ever since, and business hasn’t been as brisk as it might have been, but it’s been steady and Magna people haven’t shied away from patronizing Magna people. “The pandemic hasn’t really affected us like a lot of other businesses, so that’s been good,” Brandis says. For that matter, the pandemic doesn’t seem to have affected Magna as much either. “I don’t know one single individual that’s gotten sick with the virus,” says Brandis; “I’ve not heard of one person in Magna being sick.” And she knows quite a few of them.
