99,[BREAKING] 4.9 Magnitude Earthquake Shakes Southern California; How Bad is the Damage?,2020-04-04 03:21 UTC,https://www.techtimes.com/articles/248585/20200403/breaking-4-9-magnitude-earthquake-shakes-southern-california-how-bad-is-the-damage.htm,"  As explained, an average of 234 earthquakes with magnitudes of 3.0 to 4.0 occur each year in California and Nevada, according to a recent three-year data sample. Study shows that California has always been a center of earthquakes compared to other states. The earthquakes are caused by the movement of huge blocks of the earth's crust- the Pacific and North American plates. For example, the Pacific plate is moving northwest and scrapes it for 2 inches per year.  And this is just a normal phenomenon that happens in the area.  A magnitude 4.9 earthquake recently hit the Southern part of California and its neighboring counties tonight, April 3.  According to the United States Geological Survey, the earthquake was also experienced the most 8 miles from Palm Springs. Effects were also felt as far as San Diego, Riverside and Orange counties, with some people as far away as Los Angeles saying they felt some tremors.  Reports of casualties or building damage have not yet confirmed. Residents near California have already expressed their thoughts and panic on social media saying that after all the things that are currently happening in the world, this is not what they wanted to have at the moment.   Earthquake expert Lucy Jones explained the quake saying that it is normal for the Southern part of California to experience earthquakes as this is no longer new to the state. She said that the ""quake hit either near or on the San Jacinto fault, which she said has seen many quakes of that range over the years."" As reported in the Los Angeles Times, an average of 25 earthquakes with magnitudes between 4.0 and 5.0 occur per year in California and Nevada, according to a recent three-year data sample.   Sign up for our free newsletter for the Latest coverage!

 A large earthquake struck north of Boise Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking. The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke's Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn't interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho's coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation's highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. ""It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,"" he said. The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. ""Until the next one, I guess,"" Smith said. ""I mean, that's what we do. We're all good."" Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it. ""I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,"" Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. ""The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I'm sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating."" Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay. That quake was along what scientists call a ""normal fault,"" with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday's quake appeared to be on an unmapped ""strike-slip fault,"" causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line. ""This is one that wasn't obvious enough to be mapped before now,"" Jones said. Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they're less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists. Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake. ""An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn't surprise us,"" she said. ""They do every bit as much damage."" People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said. ""Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,"" Jones said. ""Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake. Just get down and try to cover.""

Please enter a search term.       LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — The 6.5-magnitude Tonopah earthquake was felt by many here in southern Nevada. It’s now raising questions if a similar-sized quake could rock the valley anytime soon. No damage has been reported in Las Vegas, but many people across southern Nevada felt the quake. There are about a half dozen active faults across the valley, including along Decatur Boulevard. You can tell that the ground is uneven in the area. Below is a map of some of the other fault lines. Nevada is the nation’s third-most seismically active state, behind only California and Alaska. Friday morning’s earthquake outside Tonopah is the largest in the region since another 6.8 magnitude quake nearly 70 years ago, in 1954. That’s according to the Nevada Division of Emergency Management. The last major quake with the epicenter in Nevada was a 6.0 magnitude quake in the small town of Wells in 2008. Experts anticipate that a 6.0 to 6.5-magnitude earthquake could happen in the Las Vegas valley. They say we need to be prepared. “I think it can be considered an indicator that we need to be prepared for earthquakes in our region,” said Wanda Taylor, UNLV Geoscience Professor. “That it’s not in a too populated area, it caused some damage to the highway and things like that, but had it been right under a town or something, it could have caused a lot more damage.” One woman in Pahrump says she was taken by surprise. “I was having a really good dream and then all of a sudden, my bed started shaking, and it was going back and forth, back and forth,” said Barbara Cates. “I was getting scared. I didn’t know what it was and I woke up and it was still moving.” Experts say an earthquake in Las Vegas could cause damage to infrastructure, but they point out that building codes in Clark County have been updated to increase seismic safety. In terms of how to prepare, you can bolt taller furniture to the ground and also have a three-day supply of things like water and medication. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Geonet first classified the earthquake as magnitude 5.9. No damage was reported. It lasted for more than 30 seconds and caused panic in Wellington with several people in offices and homes getting under their tables for cover. The tremors started as Ardern was on TV from the parliament building, called the beehive. ""Quite a decent shake here ... if you see things moving behind me. The beehive moves a little more than most,"" she joked on the AM Show on Newshub. Ardern assured the host that she was safe, and the interview resumed. ""I'm not under any hanging lights and I look like I am in a structurally strong place,"" she added. When updated later on the earthquake she said it was ""not an unreasonable shake.""

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- California has been preparing for the ""big one,"" the 7.8 magnitude earthquake along the San Andreas Fault, for years. As society currently navigates life during different type of disaster, how do the effects on the community compare between a health pandemic and a major earthquake in Southern California? Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones explains. ""I think the long-term effect on our society might be similar,"" said Jones. ""We're having a big disruption to our economy and we're going to have quite a few people dead."" The Southern California Earthquake Center estimates that around 2,000 people in Southern California could die in a ""big one"" scenario. ""(The coronavirus outbreak) could easily kill way more people than most earthquakes would,"" said Jones. Another key difference is preparedness. ""What's going to be different in a big earthquake is that there is no notice, so you can't go panic-buying beforehand,"" she said. ""By the time you've got a big problem, the stores are not open and the supply chains are cut."" Jones said we should take note of the items that we would want in a disaster situation and keep them on hand at all times because an earthquake will come with no notice. ""I try to get food that has an at least one year shelf life. Peanut butter, tuna fish, canned fruit,"" said Jones. She said that, unlike after a major earthquake, we do not need to be concerned about water and power. One similarity between a health pandemic and a natural disaster is the economic effect. ""The economic pain coming through is going to be huge and we can't blame the victim because that's what fear makes us do,"" said Jones. The seismologist said the challenge is that we must find a way to come together in this time of need while, literally, staying apart. ""What's really at risk isn't our individual lives, but the health of our communities,"" she said. ""This is the time we need to be a community and find a way to do that when we aren't physically together.""

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, although the quake was a surprise to many people in the area, as New York state doesn’t experience much seismic activity.   On the website Earthquake Report, numerous locals said they could feel or even hear the tremor. “No property damage. 5 to 10 second consistent rumble, light shaking. I wish I were more awake when it happened,” one person wrote from Hudson Falls. “I was already up, but it Was a loud rumble, and it shook my whole house. My windows rattled as well and it woke my husband up as it was happening. Doesn’t seem like any damage thankfully. But pretty scary,” said a local from Queensbury. “I thought a truck crashed outside my house. I was upstairs and building shook and windows rattled,” added a person from Saratoga Springs. Meanwhile, research has found that New York City, which is about 200 miles south of the earthquake, might be at risk due to its population and other factors, although earthquakes rarely hit the East Coast.  “Too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard, and not enough to the risk,” he added. “Earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when Henry Hudson sailed up the River. But earthquake risk is much, much higher today since the number of people, assets and their vulnerability are so much greater.” Share this with everyone!","There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, although the quake was a surprise to many people in the area, as New York state doesn’t experience much seismic activity.

There were no immediate reports of casualties. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit at a shallow depth of 5.6 miles (nine kilometers) near the city of Ponce and the towns of Guanica and Guayanilla, where hundreds of homes were destroyed by a quake in early January that killed one person and caused millions of dollars in damage.  — USGS Big Quakes (@USGSBigQuakes) May 2, 2020  
Reports of damage were still trickling in on Saturday, with at least one second-story balcony crashing in the southern city of Ponce, spokeswoman Inés Rivera told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, cracks in homes were reported in Guayanilla.
“Everything shook really hard,” spokesman Danny Hernández said by phone.
Meanwhile, in Guánica, Mayor Santos Seda told the AP that no major damage has been reported so far, but noted that between five to 10 people remain in a shelter since the 6.4-magnitude quake that hit in January.
“Thank God everyone is OK,” he said. “The infrastructure is already weak.”
Several aftershocks hit Puerto Rico’s southern region, including a 4.9-magnitude one.
Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, said in a phone interview that while it’s understandable many people are afraid and surprised by the most recent earthquake, it’s not unusual given the seismic activity that began in the region in late December.

“In the long run, it’s decreasing, but you can have peaks,” he said, adding that he expects strong aftershocks to continue.
The earthquake struck as Puerto Ricans are ordered to remain home as part of a two-month lockdown to help curb the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus cases. Gov. Wanda Vázquez tweeted that rescue crews were fanning out across the area and that she would shortly be traveling there to meet with those affected in person.
“If your infrastructure is damaged, you must leave with your face mask on and your emergency backpack,” she said as she urged people to remain calm.
But nerves are already frayed in many parts of the island as Puerto Rico continues to recover from Hurricane Maria, a string of strong earthquakes and the CCP virus. Silvestre Alicea, a 67-year-old man who moved back to Puerto Rico from New York upon retiring, lost his home in January’s earthquake and is still living with his sister in Guanica.
“This is unreal,” he said, adding that some neighbors have left the area to stay with relatives elsewhere and that many, including a security guard who worked all night, are now sitting nervously in their balconies. “He hasn’t slept.”
Alicea, however, said he decided to knock down a couple of breadfruits from a nearby tree as the aftershocks continue: “I’m taking it easy. There’s nothing else you can do.”

No injuries were reported, but officials said goods tumbled from market shelves, sidewalks heaved and storefront windows cracked shortly after 4 a.m. People from Salt Lake City to California’s Central Valley tweeted that they felt shaking. Lights swayed at the governor’s mansion in Carson City, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak told reporters. “It woke me up, so it definitely had an impact,” he said.  Nevada Highway Patrol photos showed cracks on U.S. 95 before crews repaired them about 35 miles (56 kilometers) west of Tonopah. A detour to State Route 360 had added more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) to motorists' trips. The vast open range east of the snow-capped Sierra Nevada is seismically active, said Graham Kent, director of the Nevada Seismological Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno. He ranked Friday's event with twin December 1954 earthquakes at Fairview Peak and Dixie Valley. Kent said those temblors were magnitudes 7.1 and 6.8, respectively. The U.S. Geological Survey reported Friday's temblor struck just east of the Sierra Nevada. It was initially reported at 6.4-magnitude. It was centered about 4.7 miles (7.6 kilometers) deep, the agency said, and dozens of aftershocks were recorded. Kent said a 5.1 magnitude aftershock struck about 30 minutes after the initial quake. State troopers and sheriff's patrols from Esmeralda and surrounding Mineral and Nye counties checked highways for possible damage. A sheriff's dispatcher in the historic mining boom town of Goldfield said the 112-year-old Esmeralda County Courthouse escaped damage. Nye County sheriff's Capt. David Boruchowitz reported no damage at the Mizpah Hotel and Clown Motel, two landmark businesses in Tonopah, a mining hub about halfway between Las Vegas and Reno. Keith Hasty, a Tonopah gas station employee, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that groceries were shaken off shelves and that residents said their televisions shook. Nye County spokesman Arnold Knightly reported broken storefront glass, stress cracks on asphalt streets, loose hanging signs, items knocked off shelves and minor lifting of sidewalks. “Overall, everything appears to be sound at this point,"" Knightly said. “”However, we have learned that other than obvious earthquake damage some damage is discovered later."" Last July, a 56-year-old backyard mechanic was found dead in Pahrump four days after strong quakes struck near Ridgecrest, California, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) away. Investigators said it appeared a Jeep he was repairing wobbled off its support jacks. State seismic network manager Ken Smith noted that Friday’s earthquake happened a few miles east of the site of a magnitude 6.2 temblor in July 1986 in California’s Chalfant Valley.  Larger earthquakes in the region in the last century included a 6.5-magnitude temblor in 1934 and a magnitude 6.8 quake in 1932, the state seismology lab said. A 6-magnitude earthquake in February 2008 damaged hundreds of structures in the northeast Nevada town of Wells, including its historic El Rancho Hotel and Casino. Officials recently announced plans to restore the hotel. ___ This story has been corrected to reference U.S. Geological Survey, not Service. ____ Associated Press writer Paul Davenport in Phoenix contributed to this report.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A 5.7-magnitude earthquake shook Salt Lake City and its suburbs early Wednesday, sending spooked residents fleeing their homes, knocking out power for tens of thousands and closing the city’s airport. The epicenter was just southwest of Salt Lake City, between the city’s airport and the Great Salt Lake. The temblor and its aftershocks physically and mentally rattled approximately 2.8 million people who are already hunkered down amid the coronavirus epidemic. There were no initial reports of injuries, said Utah Emergency Management spokesman Joe Dougherty. Operations at Salt Lake City International Airport came to a halt and the control tower and concourses were evacuated. Planes headed to Salt Lake City were diverted while officials conducted a runway inspection. Police blocked the road to the airport, allowing in only those who were picking up passengers. No runway damage was found and most of the damage in the terminal appears caused by a broken water line, said the airport’s executive director, Bill Wyatt. He said he expected the airport to reopen in “hours not days.” The quake also shut down the light rail service for Salt Lake City and its suburbs. Residents reported feeling shaking across a 100-mile (160 kilometer) area, with the heaviest impact in Salt Lake County, officials said. Some residents ran from their homes and into the streets as they felt the earthquake shake buildings for 10 to 15 seconds. There were some reports of damage, but authorities did not expect it to be severe. The quake sent bricks showering from a homeless onto the sidewalk below. In downtown Salt Lake City, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ iconic Salt Lake Temple sustained minor damage, with the trumpet falling from the Angel Moroni statue at the top of the temple and stones displaced from a spire. The temple is undergoing renovations and a seismic upgrade. Construction crews have been sent home while the damage is being assessed, church spokesman Daniel Woodruff said in a statement. Gov. Gary Herbert warned people to stay away from downtown Salt Lake City while officials assess damage. But authorities did not expect to find severe damage in most structures, said Doughtery, the emergency management spokesman. “We’re hearing of lights falling down, bookcases falling down, we’ve heard of water lines breaking inside of buildings,” Dougherty said. People reported feeling the quake in the neighboring states of Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming and Nevada. About 73,000 homes and businesses lost electricity in the Salt Lake City area, but power was quickly being restored in some areas, said utility Rocky Mountain Power. It was the largest earthquake to hit Utah since a 5.9 magnitude quake shook southern Utah in 1992, according to Utah Emergency Management. Most shaking was reported in the Salt Lake County area, near the epicenter in the Salt Lake City suburb of Magna but the quake was felt 80 miles away (130 kilometers) in the Utah city of Logan.  Dougherty recommended that people check on their neighbors, but that advice that could be challenging when people are being told to say inside their homes to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “This is the time for people to really do the right thing, make sure everyone is taken care of,” Dougherty said. “But we still do need to remember we have a pandemic going on at the same time.”

No injuries were reported, but officials said goods tumbled from market shelves, sidewalks heaved and storefront windows cracked shortly after 4 a.m. People from Salt Lake City to California’s Central Valley tweeted that they felt shaking. Lights swayed at the governor’s mansion in Carson City, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak told reporters. “It woke me up, so it definitely had an impact,” he said.  Nevada Highway Patrol photos showed cracks on U.S. 95 before crews repaired them about 35 miles (56 kilometers) west of Tonopah. A detour to State Route 360 had added more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) to motorists' trips. The vast open range east of the snow-capped Sierra Nevada is seismically active, said Graham Kent, director of the Nevada Seismological Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno. He ranked Friday's event with twin December 1954 earthquakes at Fairview Peak and Dixie Valley. Kent said those temblors were magnitudes 7.1 and 6.8, respectively. The U.S. Geological Survey reported Friday's temblor struck just east of the Sierra Nevada. It was initially reported at 6.4-magnitude. It was centered about 4.7 miles (7.6 kilometers) deep, the agency said, and dozens of aftershocks were recorded. Kent said a 5.1 magnitude aftershock struck about 30 minutes after the initial quake. State troopers and sheriff's patrols from Esmeralda and surrounding Mineral and Nye counties checked highways for possible damage. A sheriff's dispatcher in the historic mining boom town of Goldfield said the 112-year-old Esmeralda County Courthouse escaped damage. Nye County sheriff's Capt. David Boruchowitz reported no damage at the Mizpah Hotel and Clown Motel, two landmark businesses in Tonopah, a mining hub about halfway between Las Vegas and Reno. Keith Hasty, a Tonopah gas station employee, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that groceries were shaken off shelves and that residents said their televisions shook. Nye County spokesman Arnold Knightly reported broken storefront glass, stress cracks on asphalt streets, loose hanging signs, items knocked off shelves and minor lifting of sidewalks. “Overall, everything appears to be sound at this point,"" Knightly said. “”However, we have learned that other than obvious earthquake damage some damage is discovered later."" Last July, a 56-year-old backyard mechanic was found dead in Pahrump four days after strong quakes struck near Ridgecrest, California, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) away. Investigators said it appeared a Jeep he was repairing wobbled off its support jacks. State seismic network manager Ken Smith noted that Friday’s earthquake happened a few miles east of the site of a magnitude 6.2 temblor in July 1986 in California’s Chalfant Valley.  Larger earthquakes in the region in the last century included a 6.5-magnitude temblor in 1934 and a magnitude 6.8 quake in 1932, the state seismology lab said. A 6-magnitude earthquake in February 2008 damaged hundreds of structures in the northeast Nevada town of Wells, including its historic El Rancho Hotel and Casino. Officials recently announced plans to restore the hotel. ___ This story has been corrected to reference U.S. Geological Survey, not Service. ____ Associated Press writer Paul Davenport in Phoenix contributed to this report.

      A 5.7 magnitude earthquake shook the Salt Lake City area Wednesday morning, cutting power to tens of thousands and suspending work at Utah’s public health lab amid the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.
    
      Flights to Salt Lake International Airport were diverted, departures were postponed and terminals and concourses were evacuated so engineers could inspect the facilities, the airport said.
   
      The quake was centered about 10 miles west of Salt Lake City, near the city of Magna, starting at 7:09 a.m. (9:09 a.m. ET), the US Geological Survey said.
   
      People in downtown Salt Lake City left buildings and gathered outside after the quake, talking about the shaking, CNN affiliate KSL reported.
   
      “It didn’t feel like a small earthquake at all. I heard things in my kitchen falling,” Michael McCarlie, who lives in an apartment at the City Creek Landing development in the capital, told KSL.
   
      This is the state’s most powerful quake since 1992, when a magnitude 5.9 temblor struck the St. George area, Utah’s Division of Emergency Management said.
   
      Operations at the state’s public health laboratory were halted as the building was assessed for damage, the state Department of Health said. 
   
      The state’s coronavirus hotline, which residents may call to request tests and seek information, was down after the quake, Gov. Gary Herbert said on Twitter – though the health department said a temporary information line was available.
   
      The Department of Health said its lab is being assessed for damage, and testing will resume when the building is “determined to be safe.”
   
      “There were no samples being tested at the time of the earthquake,” the department said in a media advisory posted on Twitter. “Additionally, no samples or laboratory equipment were damaged during the earthquake.”
   
      Commercial labs in the state are working and still processing Covid-19 tests, the department said.
   
      By the early afternoon there were about 10,000 customers without power, down from 73,000 immediately after the quake, Rocky Mountain Power reported.
   
      “Please stay away from the downtown area while crews assess damage,” Herbert said. “Unless you work in public safety, or are an essential employee, remain at home or telework.”
   
      The quake comes as Utah residents, like people across the world, are adjusting to changes brought by the coronavirus pandemic, including canceling schools and limiting mass gatherings.
   Here’s the shaking intensity map for this earthquake. As you can see, the stronger shaking is felt around the magna area and less intense shaking radiates outward.#Utquake pic.twitter.com/ifLrgdWrzG 
      “I know the last thing we need right now is an earthquake, but here we are, and it sounds like aftershocks are likely,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said on Twitter.
   
      At the city’s iconic Mormon temple, the quake dislodged the trumpet of the angel statue atop its highest spire, video from KSL showed.
   
      “The trumpet on the Angel Moroni statue fell off, and there is minor displacement of some of the temple’s smaller spire stones,” said Daniel Woodruff, a spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
    
      Aerial photos show the fallen trumpet appeared to have landed on the roof of the temple near the base of its spires.
   
      School districts in the area have been offering grab-and-go lunch pickup programs during the coronavirus break, but some districts canceled those programs Wednesday because of the earthquake, CNN affiliate KTVX reported.
   
      The airport said Wednesday afternoon it was resuming operations after checking for damage.
   
      “The airport has completed the security sweep and is preparing to allow passengers through. … Flights will begin arriving and departing,” the airport posted on Twitter.
   
      A water line that was damaged in Concourse D has been repaired, the airport said. 
   
      The first flight left for Dallas just before 3 p.m., the airport said later. 
   
      Because fewer people are flying during the coronavirus pandemic, “evacuating the terminal buildings was easier” than it would have normally been, airport director Bill Wyatt told reporters.
   
      The runways and taxiways were not damaged, Wyatt said. Some inbound planes were diverted to Denver or elsewhere, Wyatt said.
   
      The airport said a road to the airport initially was closed after the quake, but eventually was reopened late Wednesday morning so passengers could be picked up.
   
      The Utah Department of Transportation said it didn’t appear that the roads it’s responsible for were damaged, but workers were checking to make sure. Parts of Interstate 80 were temporarily closed so inspection crews could look at bridges, it said.
   
      Several aftershocks were recorded within 20 minutes of the main quake, according to the USGS, and dozens were recorded later, including one with a 4.6 magnitude Wednesday afternoon.
   
      Generally in Utah, earthquakes greater than magnitude 5 happen once every 10 years, and quakes greater than magnitude 6 happen once every 50 years, the USGS says. 
   
      That statement takes into account instrumentation records dating back to 1962 and historical records dating back to the 1850s, the USGS says.

      A 5.0-magnitude earthquake shook West Texas on Thursday morning between the cities of El Paso and Odessa, the US Geological Survey said.
   
      The quake would have strongly shaken the epicenter, a sparsely populated area some 26 miles west of the small town of Mentone. Shaking in El Paso and Odessa was light, the USGS said.
   
      The quake happened near the line between the Mountain and Central time zones. The time was 9:16 a.m. in El Paso and 10:16 a.m. in Odessa.
   
      In El Paso, staff in the call center for the state’s 2-1-1 Texas program – a 24-hour social service hotline – evacuated over the tremors.
   Due to tremors in El Paso from the earthquake in Culberson and Reeves County, the 2-1-1 Call Center is offline as staff had to be evacuated. Calls will still be answered by the network but the local specialists are offline. 
      “Calls will still be answered by the network, but the local specialists are offline,” the city of El Paso said in a tweet.

Please enter a search term.       (CNN) — A 5.7 magnitude earthquake shook Utah’s Salt Lake City area Wednesday morning, knocking out power in some areas, officials said.  “From what we have been able to determine, it doesn’t appear this was major shaking,” Utah’s Division of Emergency Management posted on Twitter shortly after the earthquake. Still, power has been knocked out in some areas, and aftershocks are likely, the division said. Details about the extent of the outages weren’t immediately available. At least six aftershocks had been recorded within 20 minutes of the main quake, according to the USGS. This is the state’s most powerful quake since 1992, when a magnitude 5.9 temblor struck the St. George area, the division said. Generally in Utah, earthquakes greater than magnitude 5 happen once every 10 years, and quakes greater than magnitude 6 happen once every 50 years, the USGS says. That statement takes into account instrumentation records dating back to 1962, and historical records dating back to the1850s, th USGS says.

There were no reports of injuries. The 5.7-magnitude quake just after 7 a.m. damaged the spire and statue atop the iconic Salt Lake Temple. Elsewhere, bricks were showered onto sidewalks and a chemical plume was released outside the city. The epicenter was just southwest of Salt Lake City, between the airport and Great Salt Lake. It was felt by about 2.8 million people who were already hunkered down inside their homes to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Many ran outside in panic amid the shaking that lasted as long as 15 seconds. Advertisement ‘‘This is extremely bad timing, because we already have the coronavirus issue going on right now causing a lot of anxiety,” Governor Gary Herbert said. Planes were diverted from Salt Lake City International Airport and the control tower and concourses were evacuated. Far fewer people than normal were in the airport, due to the coronavirus precautions. On a typical travel day, the airport would have had about 24,000 people inside and more making connections. But there were just 9,000 on Wednesday, making an evacuation easier. airport executive director Bill Wyatt said. No runway damage was found and most of the damage in the terminal appeared to be caused by a broken water line, Wyatt said. Cargo and non-commercial flights resumed hours later, but commercial flights were delayed into the afternoon. At Salt Lake Temple, the trumpet held by the Angel Moroni fell from the statue at the top of the temple and stones were displaced from the spire. The temple is undergoing renovations and a seismic upgrade. Construction crews were sent home while the damage was assessed, church spokesman Daniel Woodruff said in a statement.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A 5.4-magnitude earthquake hit near southern Puerto Rico on Saturday, briefly knocking out power and jolting many from their beds on an island where some people still remain in shelters from previous quakes earlier this year. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit at a shallow depth of 5.6 miles (nine kilometers) near the city of Ponce and the towns of Guanica and Guayanilla, where hundreds of homes were destroyed by a quake in early January that killed one person and caused millions of dollars in damage. Reports of damage were still trickling in on Saturday, with at least one second-story balcony crashing in the southern city of Ponce, spokeswoman Inés Rivera told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, cracks in homes were reported in Guayanilla. ""Everything shook really hard,"" spokesman Danny Hernández said by phone. Meanwhile, in Guánica, Mayor Santos Seda told the AP that no major damage has been reported so far, but noted that between five to 10 people remain in a shelter since the 6.4-magnitude quake that hit in January. ""Thank God everyone is OK,"" he said. ""The infrastructure is already weak."" Several aftershocks hit Puerto Rico's southern region, including a 4.9-magnitude one. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico's Seismic Network, said in a phone interview that while it's understandable many people are afraid and surprised by the most recent earthquake, it's not unusual given the seismic activity that began in the region in late December. ""In the long run, it's decreasing, but you can have peaks,"" he said, adding that he expects strong aftershocks to continue. The earthquake struck as Puerto Ricans are ordered to remain home as part of a two-month lockdown to help curb coronavirus cases. Gov. Wanda Vázquez tweeted that rescue crews were fanning out across the area and that she would shortly be traveling there to meet with those affected in person. ""If your infrastructure is damaged, you must leave with your face mask on and your emergency backpack,"" she said as she urged people to remain calm. But nerves are already frayed in many parts of the island as Puerto Rico continues to recover from Hurricane Maria, a string of strong earthquakes and the coronavirus. Silvestre Alicea, a 67-year-old man who moved back to Puerto Rico from New York upon retiring, lost his home in January's earthquake and is still living with his sister in Guanica. ""This is unreal,"" he said, adding that some neighbors have left the area to stay with relatives elsewhere and that many, including a security guard who worked all night, are now sitting nervously in their balconies.

The initial earthquake struck about 4.7 miles deep, according to the U.S. Geological Service. At least six sizable aftershocks were recorded shortly thereafter, including two with estimated magnitudes of 5.4. The quake quickly became a trending topic on social media. Residents from Salt Lake City and California’s Central Valley also felt the quake and quickly posted about it. Reporter Anthony Bailey wrote in the caption of a video he posted on Twitter, “Studio lights sway as a 6.4 earthquake strikes near Tonopah, Nevada.” A Fresno resident—a major city in California of almost half a million people and approximately 140 miles from the initial quake—posted that the earthquake woke her up.   — Seannon Jones (@_jonesstyle_) May 15, 2020  
According to the National Earthquake Information Center, California generally gets two or three earthquakes with a magnitude of 5.5 and higher every year.
These earthquakes are considered large enough to cause moderate damage to buildings and infrastructure in the state.
The strongest earthquake to hit the state on record measured 7.9 in magnitude and hit near Fort Tejon in 1857, leaving a surface rupture scar over 217 miles in length along the San Andreas fault.

         Boise, Idaho — A powerful earthquake struck north of Boise Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting that they felt shaking. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 6.5 temblor hit just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.  More than 2 million people live in the region who could have felt the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana and Salt Lake City, Utah. CBS Boise affiliate KBOI-TV says reports flooded its newsroom and popped up on social media from all over the Northwest and even Canada. Viewers said it lasted between 20-30 seconds. Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke's Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital shook but the quake didn't interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County, about 65 miles south of the epicenter, is on the front line of Idaho's coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation's highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. ""It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,"" he said.  The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. ""Until the next one, I guess,"" Smith said. ""I mean, that's what we do. We're all good."" Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it.  ""I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,"" Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. ""The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I'm sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating."" Greg Hogan, owner of Redwood Cabins in Stanley, told KBOI the quake took him and his 12-year-old son by surprise. ""It was like a heard of rhinos, rhinoceros were running through the house,"" Hogan said. ""My boy's looking at me with his eyes wide open and I just picked him up, grabbed him, and went outside until it settled down. It was a rattler."" "" … It was definitely jolting,"" he said. Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this strength every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay.  That quake was along what scientists call a ""normal fault"" and caused vertical movement, she said. Tuesday's quake appeared to be on an unmapped ""strike-slip fault,"" causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line.  ""This is one that wasn't obvious enough to be mapped before now,"" Jones said.  Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they're less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists.  Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake.  ""An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn't surprise us,"" she said. ""They do every bit as much damage."" People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said.  ""Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,"" Jones said. ""Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous - people die from running in an earthquake. Just get down and try to cover.   Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

Boise State research Professor Dr. Lee Liberty said he was with his family when he felt the magnitude 6.5 earthquake shake the ground for 20 seconds Tuesday night.  Liberty drove to the site of the earthquake in the Challis National Forest on Wednesday. He said he is dropping seismic equipment into the ground to study the aftershocks. “We are deploying seismometers, so what we do is we dig a hole about a foot, to 2 feet deep and put in a sensor the size of a small bucket, and some cables come out of the ground,” said Dr. Liberty. This is not the first big earthquake to hit the region. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck just outside Salt Lake City, Utah two weeks ago. “The question is are they related? They are on related fault systems. These are all part of larger faults extending across the Great Basin, which includes parts of Utah, all of Nevada, parts of Idaho, so in that sense, they are connected,” said Dr. Liberty. Dr. Austin Elliott at the U.S. Geological Survey said aftershocks will continue but people may not even feel them. “That’s completely common after large earthquakes. The potential for a larger earthquake is slightly greater, but still very small…this is a reminder that Idaho like other western states is earthquake country,” said Dr. Elliott.

         A 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Magna, Utah, Wednesday morning, according to the United States Geological Survey. The temblor knocked out power for tens of thousands and operations at Salt Lake City International Airport came to a halt. It is the largest earthquake to hit the state since a 5.9 magnitude quake struck southern Utah in 1992, according to Utah Emergency Management.The quake  was felt across Salt Lake County and in Ogden and as far away as Wyoming, CBS affiliate KUTV reports.  Utah Governor Gary Herbert asked people on Twitter to stay away from Salt Lake City's downtown area ""while crews assess damage,"" unless they work in public safety, or are an essential employee. According to the governor, the earthquake damaged both the state's department of health lab and its coronavirus hotline.  ""The (Utah Department of Health) state lab is assessing damage and currently down. The poison control center has been evacuated and the (Utah Coronavirus) hotline is down,"" Herbert tweeted Wednesday.

1876,Scientists closely monitor underwater volcano off Hawaii after rare earthquake swarm,2020-05-13 20:29 UTC,https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2020/05/13/scientists-closely-monitor-underwater-volcano-off-hawaii-after-rare-earthquake-swarm/,"HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Volcanologists are keeping a close eye on their instruments after a rare earthquake swarm off the Big Island the past two days. Twenty miles off the southeast coast of the Big Island, Hawaii’s newest volcano rises 10,000 feet from the ocean floor with its summit about 3,000 feet under the surface. When Loihi starts shaking, scientists pay attention. ""Think of it as a younger version of Kilauea or Mauna Loa volcanoes,"" said David Phillips, deputy scientist in charge at Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. Phillips said there's no significant hazard at the moment, but at one point HVO recorded 14 earthquakes per hour on the Loihi Seamount. “The peak did take place yesterday afternoon, whether it continues to subside or come back is hard to say,” Phillips said. On a seismogram, more than a hundred temblors struck in the 2- to 3-magnitude range, suggesting magma is on the move. Phillips said if the shaking continues, it could signal an eruption — and that could cause a summit collapse. That’s happened before, last in 1996. A significant eruption could even cause a small tsunami. “There would be very little time to respond,” Phillips said. “It would be certainly less than an hour, could be minutes.” But there is no sign of trouble right now. “From everything we’ve seen, there’s nothing like that coming,” Phillips said. The seamount appears to have settled down. Besides the occasional rumble, the most exciting things on Loihi are the creatures that thrive in the hot water nearly a mile deep.

Shallow quakes tend to be more damaging than quakes centered at greater depths, according to the USGS. Boise Mayor Lauren McLean tweeted out ""Boise, yes you did feel an #earthquake.

Several aftershocks rattled Idaho by Wednesday morning, with 4.6, 3.4, and 3.6-magnitude shocks felt throughout Boise and the Treasure Valley. KTVB contacted several gas stations in Challis, Stanley, and Cascade and they said there was no severe damage to buildings or property there. The Boise Police Department tweeted Tuesday that they have not received any reports of damage. But the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist on 8th Street in Boise posted online that the tremors had cracked the stone cross on top of the cathedral. The cathedral asked for prayers that the cross could be salvaged with repairs.  The Custer County Sheriff's Office told KTVB that they have no reported structural damage at this time. Officials with St. Luke's said they've completed floor by floor checks of all of their hospitals and gave given the all-clear. A spokeswoman for Idaho Power said the company has conducted inspections of all its power plants and dams and found no damage to any of them. The earthquake also resulted in no outages.

A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck in remote western Nevada near Tonopah early Friday, damaging U.S. Highway 95 in several areas and causing its closure until early afternoon.  The quake’s depth was estimated to be 4.7 miles.  The largest repair entailed a 9-foot-wide-by-40-foot-long pavement patch. Permanent repairs will be scheduled in the future, although it’s too early yet to determine the cost and timeline. Photos from Esmeralda County showed a crack several inches wide running through both lanes of the highway. Mineral County Sheriff’s Office dispatcher Jim Kenner said residents in the county got a good shaking. “We’ve got a lot of calls from frightened residents, but none of them report any damage,” he said. Nye County Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said the earthquake shook “the northern portion of Nye and Esmeralda counties.” “A cursory windshield survey discovered some broken windows in Tonopah,” Wehrly said. “Patrol officers were sent north due to a report of damage to Highway 95 and possible damage in Gabbs.” The sheriff’s office said it would provide additional updates if more damage is discovered. Nye County spokesman Arnold Knightly said that as of midmorning, there had been 23 magnitude 3 or higher aftershocks following the initial quake.

A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck in remote western Nevada near Tonopah early Friday, damaging U.S. Highway 95 in several areas and causing its closure until early afternoon.  The quake’s depth was estimated to be 4.7 miles.  The largest repair entailed a 9-foot-wide-by-40-foot-long pavement patch. Permanent repairs will be scheduled in the future, although it’s too early yet to determine the cost and timeline. Photos from Esmeralda County showed a crack several inches wide running through both lanes of the highway.

1999,Earthquake near Boise rattles 3-state area; no major damage reported,2020-04-01 01:04 UTC,https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nation-and-world/earthquake-near-boise-rattles-3-state-area-no-major-damage-reported-1995999/,"The earthquake is added stress during an already stressful time for the region. BOISE, Idaho — An earthquake struck north of Boise Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking. The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana, and Salt Lake City, Utah. The 6.5 earthquake near Stanley, Idaho was the 2nd-largest earthquake in the world over the past 30 days. pic.twitter.com/50ZoCtXRSF — NWS Boise (@NWSBoise) April 1, 2020   Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke’s Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn’t interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho’s coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation’s highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. “It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said. The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.” 

Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it.
“I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I’m sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.”
Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay.
That quake was along what scientists call a “normal fault,” with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday’s quake appeared to be on an unmapped “strike-slip fault,” causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line.
“This is one that wasn’t obvious enough to be mapped before now,” Jones said.
Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they’re less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists.
Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake.
“An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn’t surprise us,” she said. “They do every bit as much damage.”
People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said.
“Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,” Jones said. “Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake. Just get down and try to cover.”

2002,Did COVID-19 and an earthquake raise your anxiety? You're not alone,2020-03-19 04:00 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2020/3/18/21185656/covid-19-utah-coronavirus-earthquake-anxiety-primary-childrens-ogden-regional-children-seniors,"Candy Whisler hugs her scared dog Athena and grandson Paris Whisler after a 5.7 magnitude earthquake centered in Magna hit on Wednesday, March 18, 2020. Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — Shortly after a 5.7 magnitude earthquake hit the Wasatch Front Wednesday morning, a woman and a couple of her friends were tossing bricks from the shattered chimney of her downtown bungalow-style home.  “It feels like a bit much,” said the woman, who declined to offer her name. “Seriously. This is a lot.” Loreen Sjoblom felt the same way after she was violently shaken awake in Midvale by the earthquake. She and her husband Ron have been leading a pretty quiet existence at home since the novel coronavirus pandemic reached Utah, obeying public health instructions to keep away from others because he’s 70 and she’s 69. Age puts them at higher risk of complications — and though they’ve tried to make light of any danger, they don’t want  to take any chances. Adding an earthquake to the uncertainty of COVID-19 feels a little “ridiculous, just too much,” she said. “I’m thinking, it’s odd the way it’s all piling on.” She’s more worried than she wants to admit, even to herself, she said. “I’m telling myself I’m not stressing, but I was calling everyone to make sure they were OK. Sometimes I lie to myself about what I feel.” Experts say northern Utah residents can be forgiven if they’re feeling overwhelmed, even spooked, after an earthquake was layered on top of their fears about a pandemic. “In cases of multiple stresses, having high levels of distress is normal,” said Dana Garfin, assistant professor at University of California Irvine’s Sue & Bill Groves School of Nursing. One of her specialties is repeated exposure to trauma and she said this certainly counts. “In the acute aftermath of a traumatic event, people experience higher levels of stress.”  The adversities have piled on incrementally, from the threat of potentially serious illness for some, to supply shortages, job hours cut back or eliminated, people told to work from home, businesses and schools closing, social lives halted, child care worries, reduced incomes and more. The experience of children and senior citizens has been remarkably parallel, but working-age adults are sharing the stress of both age groups, while dealing with other pressures of their own. There was nothing slow about the trauma of the earthquake. That hit fast and then was followed up with little gut punches for several hours in the form of aftershocks. Taking a significant ongoing traumatic experience and adding another amplifies anxiety. said Keeshin. “They add on in terms of potential impact. Someone who might not be too bothered by the earthquake normally might be bothered a fair amount more than one would expect” right now. People in the same household or identical situations may be reacting very differently. That’s normal, too, Garfin said. The first tremors and aftershocks had subsided and the staff was having lunch in a private dining room at Pacifica Senior Living in Millcreek when a significant aftershock — reported at magnitude 4.6 — rattled workers along with the tableware. They immediately got up to check residents who are mostly staying in their rooms as part of social distancing to avoid COVID-19. “Be calm,” Stephanie Klingbiel, executive director, said she warned staff, knowing the residents would take their cue from how their caregivers were acting. Besides nerves from knowing they are at risk, the senior citizens’ routines have changed, too. Area care centers and senior living programs have canceled outside activities and outings. The senior citizens are not going out even for doctor appointments unless they are unavoidable.  Ditto for kids and whole families. The youngsters find themselves with time off from school — but no ability to play with their friends. Will they go back to class soon? There’s a lot of uncertainty. For older students, will graduations take place on time? Will important events — what about the prom — be canceled?  Garfin said people like their difficulties to be acknowledged. But they also need to know that they’re not helpless.  While they can’t control the pandemic or the earthquake, they can control what they do. Garfin said following the public health recommendations for COVID-19 and advice from officials in natural disasters gives one a sense of command and also opens the door to options for helping others. Many, like Sjoblom, find strength in checking in with loved ones, commiserating and seeing if they can help each other. It’s a natural and healthy response. “I think reaching out to people, letting them know they’re not alone, they are part of a community, is great. There are people they can turn to even if maybe not in the way they are used to,” Garfin said. The seniors at Legacy Village of Sugar House, a senior living community with a continuum of services, have been grateful for a community response to COVID-19 that makes keeping older people safe a priority, though they are more isolated from family and friends, said executive director Dave Egbert. They’re used to congregating for meals, so eating in their rooms has been a big change, Some find it a bit disconcerting, so the staff has tried to lighten things up by visiting often and being cheerful. Positivity is as contagious as gloom — and more enjoyable. It’s a skill to trot out during crisis, he said. With activities canceled, everyone has more time to worry, from the senior citizens to the high school seniors and the children whose routines were disrupted. Those who are elderly have a longer perspective. They’ve already been through more. Egbert said life may have helped them be prepared emotionally for recent unsettling events. Elevated stress hormones wreak havoc on every part of the body, so learning how to calm oneself down becomes really important, according to Jennifer James, a registered dietitian nutritionist and certified health coach at Ogden Regional Medical Center. She said people are often not taught to manage their emotions in a constructive way. It’s a good idea to acknowledge how you’re feeling, even if you’re feeling really bad. Author Brene Brown writes that verbalizing a feeling and processing it without trying to change it can allow the feeling to pass naturally and a person to be resilient. People in serious distress should meet with a counselor. During this pandemic, many therapists are meeting with patients online. Simple, readily available tools may help, including meditation, writing in a journal, keeping a gratitude journal or turning to a hobby or activity that’s enjoyable. Meditation is mentioned often by experts as a way to lower stress. James said it changes the structure and function of the brain, helping people be calmer, more circumspect, and less emotional in hard situations. She suggests making it a regular part of a day. “It’s something I sometimes have to make myself do, like brushing my teeth. I do it to be healthy. It’s not always enjoyable. But I am a better listener, more focused, more relaxed and I do not react to things as strongly as I would in the past,” she said. She teaches cardio rehab patients to meditate. Garfin likes that meditation can be done whenever and wherever. There are a lot of great free apps to help someone learn. She said it lowers the sympathetic nervous system response. Stress is chronically activated in the aftermath of trauma unless it’s calmed down. But lowing that internal level of anxiety and the physiological response has mental and physical benefits.  Prayer has effects that are similar to meditation. Exercise is another tool to reduce stress. Exercise doesn’t have to be strenuous, but can be matched to the level and capability of the person doing it.  And even with social distancing, people can find ways to plug into their favorite activities and rituals. Many churches, mosques and synagogues, for instance, are still holding services that can be viewed online. “People are probably going to be experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress,” said Garfin, as well as manageable levels of panic. They won’t last forever. They should use the available resources they find helpful.  Though this particular earthquake was significant, it wasn’t massive. Children were likely not unsafe, but it’s natural if their response is disproportionate, Keeshin said. Their bodies were primed to be in a “ready-for-danger” position by the coronavirus outbreak. “Add another on top of it and the response is magnified.” In homes where the power was out, many kids couldn’t even do some of the things that might normally settle them down, like go online and reach out to friends. Parents need to talk to their kids about what’s going on, being open and honest and answer questions  Keeshin said to use developmentally appropriate language and have the conversations in a setting where everyone involved can really focus.  How you approach possible trauma matters. Asking open-ended questions is better than suggesting how someone feels. It also opens the door to answer the questions a child really wants to ask. If the earthquake is the issue, you can talk about how to be safe. In a power outage, maybe they’re worried more about no internet to make sure their grandparents are safe than whether there’s no light. “You can’t assume what’s distressing or most bothersome for kids,” Keeshin said. It takes a conversation.  The advice for children is helpful for adults who are anxious, too.  “Caregivers and others could be feeling those exact same things. It’s OK. It’s a normal, natural response,” Keeshin said. “It’s OK for you to take the time necessary to deal with it or to help problem-solve or mitigate.” The National Child Traumatic Stress Network has a fact sheet to help parents talk to their children about COVID-19, answering questions and guiding a conversation in age-sensitive ways. It’s a model for talking about other stressors, too. Children at different ages have different trauma reactions and the best approach varies. Keeshin said if a child was already highly anxious or struggling before COVID-19 or the earthquake, it’s really appropriate to call the pediatrician and ask for some additional guidance. Just don’t take them into the office; health officials are asking people to avoid physical visits that might expose more people to COVID-19.  “Stay positive,” said Klingbiel. “You can’t function if you’re with someone who is negative.”  Copyright © 2023 Deseret News Publishing Company.

 BOISE, Idaho — A large earthquake struck north of Boise on Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking.  The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Mont., and Salt Lake City, Utah. Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke’s Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn’t interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho’s coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation’s highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. “It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said. The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.”  Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it. “I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I’m sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.”  Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay. That quake was along what scientists call a “normal fault,” with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday’s quake appeared to be on an unmapped “strike-slip fault,” causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line. “This is one that wasn’t obvious enough to be mapped before now,” Jones said. Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they’re less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists. Residents in the region likely will continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake. “An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn’t surprise us,” she said. “They do every bit as much damage.”  People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said. “Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,” Jones said. “Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake. Just get down and try to cover.”

Steve Griffin, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — The coronavirus pandemic hasn’t shut down Salt Lake City’s golf courses yet, but Wednesday morning’s earthquake did. All of the five operating courses (Mountain Dell has not opened yet) were shut down for the day by the city following the early morning earthquake. That included Bonneville, Forest Dale, Nibley Park, Glendale and Rose Park.  Bonneville head pro Lynn Landgren said he was told to shut down the course, which only had a half dozen golfers out at the time, soon after the earthquake hit shortly after 7 a.m. The other courses apparently hadn’t opened for the day. He was told the shutdown was not related to the coronavirus crisis and he expected the golf courses to be running later this week.      Copyright © 2023 Deseret News Publishing Company.

2062,Is a larger earthquake now imminent in Utah?,2020-03-18 16:40 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/3/18/21185295/earthquake-utah-magnitude-salt-lake-city-aftershock,"A firefighter arrives on scene where debris fell off of a building at 400 South and 500 West in Salt Lake City after a 5.7 magnitude earthquake centered in Magna hit early on Wednesday, March 18, 2020. Spenser Heaps, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — The earthquake that rattled the Salt Lake Valley and beyond Wednesday morning does not mean that a bigger one is on the way, a University of Utah seismologist said. Keith Koper, a U. geology and geophysics professor, said the 5.7 magnitude quake that hit the Wasatch Front was “moderate” in size, but considered big for Utah.  “It is not imminent that there is another large earthquake to come,” he said. “Do not expect a much larger earthquake. Do not expect a magnitude 7.” Koper said there is small — 4% to 5% — probability for a bigger earthquake to follow, but historically most earthquake sequences don’t unfold that way. The epicenter was north of Magna, between the city and Antelope Island near the edge of the Great Salt Lake, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. “We know it’s possible that there’s this few percent chance that it could happen and that’s just based on previous observations,” he said. “But the fact is, we can’t and we don’t predict earthquakes.” State agencies were also quelling speculation on social media that a magnitude 9.0 earthquake would hit the state because of Wednesday’s event. “Although it is possible that a larger earthquake in this area could be in the magnitude range of 7.0 to 7.5, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the chance of an earthquake of this size is about 1 in 300. Earthquakes of magnitude larger than 7.5 are unlikely to occur in Utah. A magnitude 9.0 earthquake is not possible in Utah,” according to the U. Health Department.   “The greater Magna area is probably not going to get to sleep a lot in the next few days because of this,” said Bob Carey, response and recovery bureau chief for the Utah Division of Emergency Management. Steven Bowman, Utah Geological Survey geologic hazards program manager, echoed Koper, saying, “As we go forward, we expect that we’re going to continue to have some of these smaller aftershocks.” Bowman said in addition to helping building inspectors, crews of geologists were out in the field checking for geological disruptions like landslides or liquefaction, a phenomenon that occurs after earthquakes where sand “boils” up from the ground. Bowman told reporters the damage was minimal.   “So far, we’ve only seen very small geologic evidence of damage,” he said at a news conference. “Some of these older buildings that are brick have had a lot more damage.” Koper described the quake as “relatively shallow,” with a depth of about 6 miles, and because of that it would be felt more strongly near the epicenter. Jess Anderson, Utah Department of Public Safety commissioner, said the earthquake was felt as far away as southern Idaho and Wyoming, across the Uinta Basin and into Millard County.  “We have every person that has always planned and prepared for this at the table and fully functional at this time,” Anderson said.    Sometimes the magnitude of an earthquake can change with more data, and the Magna quake could go up to 5.8 magnitude, Koper said. “It’s not going to get very much bigger than that,” he said. Still, having had at 5.7 magnitude earthquake doesn’t reduce the risk of having future earthquakes on the Wasatch Fault system. “This was not the big one. This is sort of a wake-up call,” Koper said, adding the state should maybe install an earthquake early warning system like the one that recently went live on the West Coast.   Carey said Utahns should use Wednesday’s “designer” earthquake as an opportunity to “calmly” review their family emergency preparedness plans.  “This is the earthquake I always wanted to have happen. I know that sounds nutty. But it puts us now to understand that we can actually have this. It’s not that we’ve been barking at the moon for all these years because it kind of feels like that,” he said. “And this is just a little one. Just think what our big one is going to look like.” Wednesday’s earthquake happened on the Wasatch Fault system, Koper said. The fault parallels the western base of the Wasatch Mountains for 220 miles from near Fayette, Sanpete County, in the south to near Malad, Idaho, in the north. Koper compared the fault to a tree trunk with many branches, and said the earthquake occurred a little west of the main fault line. “One of the reasons we’re having all these aftershocks is because of this main shock that happened. In general, these are all on the Wasatch Front system, so we’re not giving it a new name, a different name,” he said. Utah is built on an ancient lakebed. Part of the reason Wednesday’s shaking was relatively strong is that there’s a lot of sediment or weak rock in the basin, he said. “When you have an earthquake, the ground motion will get amplified. The energy in a sense will get trapped in the basin and it will act sort of like a bowl of jelly,” he said. That’s why people in tall buildings downtown felt significant swaying and shaking and people on the bench not as much, Koper said. Carey noted that some people in close proximity to each other had different experiences. One woman felt the shaking outside, but a man in the garage did not, he said. “People feel it different ways. The soil responds differently,” he said. Koper described the main 5.7 magnitude shock as a “normal faulting” earthquake, meaning the earth’s crust was stretched sideways. One side of the fault slipped downward on the other side of the fault, he said. “This is the type of earthquake that is very typical for this area,” he said. “It is different than the type of earthquakes that normally happen in California, which tend to be more strike-slip or the earthquakes that happen in Alaska, which tend to be crust earthquakes.” Koper said a magnitude 7.0 earthquake would release 1,000 times more energy than a magnitude 6.0. “It’s a totally differently animal, a magnitude 7 versus a magnitude 5.7. It would have been horrific if a magnitude 7 happened where this 5.7 happened this morning,” he said. “You wouldn’t be here. You wouldn’t be able to get here. That would be the difference. You would have significant infrastructure issues. Your biggest problem would be to try to figure out if whether your loved ones had made it out of that,” Carey told reporters at a news conference. “This is one that’s going to catch your attention, and I think we can use this to help better prepare ourselves, but it’s a walk in the park.”       Copyright © 2023 Deseret News Publishing Company.

It ruptured nearby U.S. 95 — a major artery between Las Vegas and Reno — and swung chandeliers in the quiet historic towns it was closest to.  But no injuries have been reported and structures — even notoriously unstable historic buildings — made it through seemingly unscathed.  Take that same earthquake and recenter it underneath Reno, a situation that's more when than if, and it could have yielded ""millions of dollars of damage and loss of life,"" Kent said.  That natural disaster would have only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which would vastly complicate the normal practice of placing displaced people in mass evacuation centers. Now, an evacuation center would place scores of people at risk for exposure to the virus, adding another layer onto an already complicated situation.   Though the largest quake of this sequence hit just after 4 a.m. Friday morning, Kent stressed Nevada is not yet out of the woods.  Aftershocks — some of them fairly strong — have been happening by the hundreds in the hours after the 6.5, Kent said.  The six strongest of them happened in the hour immediately after the quake, all of them above magnitude 4.5.  There's also a chance that what's currently being referred to as the mainshock — the 6.5 earthquake — was actually a foreshock, and the largest earthquake is yet to come.  The United States Geological Survey pegs the chance that a larger earthquake will happen in the next week in that region at about 4%.  But Kent said the odds are likely a bit higher than that. When the USGS calculates that percentage, it's using statistics from a much larger area than just western Nevada and eastern California, he explained.  Historically, large earthquakes hitting in pairs or as a series is fairly characteristic of the seismic zone that ruptured on Friday, which is known as the Walker Lane.  The Walker Lane is a 60-mile wide band of active faults that stretches from the Mojave Desert in southern California, through western Nevada (and the Reno area) and back into northern California.  Kent rattled off a list of famous Walker Lane earthquakes over the past 30 to 40 years which happened in pairs.  The 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence, which happened on the southern end of the Walker Lane and was responsible for Nevada's first earthquake-related death, was highlighted by a 6.4 foreshock on July 4 followed by a magnitude 7.1 mainshock on July 5.  Even the strongest earthquake ever recorded in Nevada, the 1954 Fairview earthquake east of Reno, was a series of five strong earthquakes. The strongest two — a 6.8 foreshock and the 7.1 mainshock — happened just four minutes apart.  Kent said his lab is deploying additional remote sensors in the area of Friday's earthquake sequence to get a better handle on what the ground is doing.  ""So whether (the odds of another large quake) are 4% or 20% or 35 percent, there is that potential we saw in Ridgecrest,"" Kent said. ""So it's important for us to maybe catch that with more equipment on the ground.""  While seismic activity continues near Tonopah and the risk for a larger earthquake remains, that doesn't mean Friday's earthquake sequence will trigger some sort of chain reaction that sets off a quake near one of Nevada's population centers.  That activity is just too far away from Las Vegas and Reno to cause a chain reaction like that, Kent said.  ""But that doesn't mean mother nature doesn't have a sense of humor and just randomly puts one nearby,"" he said, adding that residents of Nevada should be prepared by visiting shakeout.org/Nevada and learn the drop, cover and hold drill.  Sam Gross is a breaking news reporter for the Reno Gazette Journal who covers wildfires, emergencies and more.

2138,"Large earthquake in Nevada desert felt in Sacramento, throughout California",2020-05-15 23:57 UTC,https://www.pennlive.com/nation-world/2020/05/large-earthquake-in-nevada-desert-felt-in-sacramento-throughout-california.html,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — A large earthquake struck in a remote area of western Nevada early Friday. The quake — initially reported by the U.S. Geological Service at a magnitude of 6.4 — could be felt in Sacramento, more than 300 miles away. The quake was reported just after 4 a.m. PDT near Tonopah, Nev., about 100 miles east of Yosemite National Park and roughly halfway between Reno and Las Vegas. Twitter was full of people reporting they felt the earthquake in Sacramento, Fresno and the San Francisco Bay Area. It was followed by a series of small aftershocks, the USGS reported. Friday’s earthquake was close in magnitude to a 6.5 earthquake that hit the Boise, Idaho, area on March 31. Some of the most recent earthquakes and aftershocks felt in Northern California came in March and shook the coast, with magnitude 4.8 and 5.8 quakes striking about 50 miles west of Petrolia in Humboldt County. According to a previous story in The Sacramento Bee, while the likelihood of a significant earthquake in Sacramento is considerably lower than in the Bay Area, that doesn’t mean it can’t occur, said Richard Armstrong, a Sacramento State professor who studies earthquake engineering. “It’s just less likely,” he said. Still, even if Sacramento doesn’t face the same earthquake threat as other cities such as San Francisco or Los Angeles, “it has felt the effects of earthquakes in the past and likely will in the future,” according to California Geological Survey spokesman Don Drysdale. For example, if a major earthquake were to hit near the city, the shaking could loosen sandy soil deposits, allowing water to penetrate and saturate the earth. The liquified soil could then lose its strength, cracking and moving underneath structures like levees and buildings, Drysdale said. Sacramento County could experience strong shaking during a large earthquake, but the resulting damage would be less than areas near major active faults such as the Bay Area. Buildings specifically designed to withstand earthquakes and other “well-built” structures would likely survive a major earthquake, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Shoddier buildings may have considerable damage or collapse entirely. In 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey created animations of different earthquake scenarios along the Hayward Fault, a major active fault that runs under East Bay, including Berkeley, Oakland and San Jose. Simulations of a strong magnitude-6.8 earthquake or more show Sacramento would likely experience significant shaking — the kind that would awaken most, and cause some dishes and windows to move or break, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. But smaller earthquakes are far more common, and those are usually experienced without an issue in Sacramento.

Please enter a search term.       TONOPAH, Nev. (AP) — Authorities in western Nevada checked for possible highway damage following a magnitude 6.5 earthquake in a remote area early Friday.  The initial quake struck about 4.7 miles (7.6 kilometers) deep, the USGS said, and dozens of aftershocks were recorded in the next three hours, including two with estimated magnitudes of 4.9. There were no immediate reports of injury, but part of U.S. 95 was closed as state troopers and sheriff’s deputies from Esmeralda and Mineral counties checked that highway and State Route 360 for possible damage, the Mineral County sheriff’s office said. The Nye County sheriff’s office was also checking a report of possible damage to U.S. 95, Capt. David Boruchowitz told KSNV-TV in Las Vegas. “Other than that, just a bunch of people shaken up.” The quake occurred in a remote area of the state between Reno and Las Vegas. Social media users in California reported feeling the earthquake in Bakersfield, Fresno, the Bay Area and Sacramento. “It really shook a lot of groceries off the shelves,” Keith Hasty, an employee at a gas station in Tonopah, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Hasty said residents who frequented the store were all talking about the quake. “We have a lot of locals coming in saying their TVs were shaking, they felt it,” said Hasty. “No damage that I’ve heard of. My boss just called and said his garage shook.” The USGS site showed over 13,200 responses from users saying they felt the quake. Latest from the USGS.

""I thought it was just the wind outside the house so I got up and raised the blind and it was sunny outside,"" said Boise resident Chris Wadner. ""I didn’t have any pictures fall off the wall or mirrors or anything like that, I don’t think there was any damage.” There was some damage as a cross a top St. John's Cathedral in Boise was cracked, but there were no reported injuries because of the earthquake. Idaho Power found no damage to the 17 dams they manage, the Idaho Transportation Department has been clearing debris off the highways and ITD also closed down avalanche alley blocking the route from Stanley to Lowman, however, they did that before the earthquake happened. We also made a trip to Idaho City and residents there told from a distance (COVID-19 Social Distancing) there was only minor damage, but the quake shook their house pretty intensely.  So far there have been dozens of aftershocks and seismologist Jim Zollweg told us we can expect more in the coming days. “Probably the biggest aftershock will be somewhere in the range of five to five and a half  that kind of magnitude of Earthquake would only be lightly felt in the Boise area,"" said Zollweg. ""If the earthquake would have been in a populated area there would have been significant property damage."" So for now it looks like we were are able to come through the latest curveball 2020 has thrown at us as Idaho recorded the fifth largest earthquake in the world this year. ""Some years are like this, some years are calm you, just never know,"" said Wadner. Experts tell us the quake has no connection to super volcano in the Yellowstone National Park area, but people felt the earthquake in the states surrounding Idaho including in Bozeman, Montana where I grew up. People there say they felt it and Bozeman is located 90 miles north of Yellowstone.","“Probably the biggest aftershock will be somewhere in the range of five to five and a half  that kind of magnitude of Earthquake would only be lightly felt in the Boise area,"" said Zollweg.

The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke’s Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn’t interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho’s coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation’s highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. “It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said. The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.” Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it. “I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I’m sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.” Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay. That quake was along what scientists call a “normal fault,” with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday’s quake appeared to be on an unmapped “strike-slip fault,” causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line. “This is one that wasn’t obvious enough to be mapped before now,” Jones said. Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they’re less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists. Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake. “An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn’t surprise us,” she said. “They do every bit as much damage.” People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said. “Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,” Jones said. “Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake.

The earthquake struck north of Boise, Idaho, Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking. (Tyler Beyer via AP) BOISE, Idaho – An earthquake struck north of Boise Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking.  The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.  More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana, and Salt Lake City, Utah.  Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke's Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn't interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho's coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation's highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. “It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said.  The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.” Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it.  “I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I'm sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.” Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay.  That quake was along what scientists call a “normal fault,” with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday's quake appeared to be on an unmapped “strike-slip fault,"" causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line.  “This is one that wasn't obvious enough to be mapped before now,” Jones said.  Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they're less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists.  Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake.  “An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn't surprise us,” she said. “They do every bit as much damage.” People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said.  “Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,"" Jones said. “Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake.

2150,Earthquake shakes Boise with 6.5 magnitude that could be Idaho's second-strongest ever,2020-04-01 02:32 UTC,https://www.pennlive.com/news/2020/04/earthquake-shakes-boise-with-65-magnitude-that-could-be-idahos-second-strongest-ever.html,"Boise has a lot of attractions, and for two weeks, free parking in city garages has been one of them.Courtesy of Visit Idaho By Chadd Cripe, Ximena Bustillo, Kate Talerico, Hayley Harding, Nicole Blanchard and Nicole Foy | The Idaho Statesman  The shaking was reported to last for 20 to 30 seconds, with a small pause. U.S. Geological Survey pegged the earthquake at 6.5 magnitude with an epicenter in the mountains northwest of Stanley. The epicenter was about 28 miles west of Challis, the National Weather Service said.   “Stuff was flying all over the place,” Botti said. “I was upstairs and I tried to walk down the steps and I couldn’t because it was shaking too much.” According to the Idaho Statesman archive, the 6.5 magnitude would be the second-largest earthquake in Idaho history if it stands (the number often is adjusted with more information). The Borah Peak earthquake, which was a magnitude 6.9, killed two people in Challis near the quake’s epicenter. The second-largest is a three-way tie at 5.8 from 1983-84. The five strongest previous Idaho earthquakes were all in the Challis area. Expect more earthquakes in the days to come, USGS says. There’s a 99% chance of aftershocks of magnitude 3 or higher and a 48% chance of a magnitude 5 quake or higher, its forecast says. “According to our forecast, over the next one week there is a 4% chance of one or more aftershocks that are larger than magnitude 6.5,” the USGS forecast says. “It is likely that there will be smaller earthquakes over the next one week, with 4 to 790 magnitude 3 or higher aftershocks. Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily.” “We don’t have any reports of damage just yet,” Hayley Williams of Boise Police said. “We haven’t sent any first responders out — police or fire,” Stephany Galbreaith of Meridian Police said. “Our first responders are out doing building checks downtown. We’ve already done a scan of all of our public works facilities and they all look good,” Boise Mayor Lauren McLean said. Idaho resident Anna Eberlin sent the Idaho Statesman a photo of a mirror that crashed in her house. “A large mirror fell off our wall and shattered,” she said. “It scared my kids and me half to death. Everyone is OK after some tears and nervous excitement about their first earthquake.” Typically Idaho earthquakes tend to occur in the central and southeast parts of the state. Recently, a swarm of low-magnitude quakes rumbled across Southern Idaho and parts of Utah and California. Idaho’s last strong earthquake was in 1983. Two earthquakes rattled the Boise area in the mid-1940s, according to the Idaho Geological Survey. Another in 1916 “wrecked several brick chimneys at Boise and sent residents rushing into the street.” There were immediate reports that the earthquake was felt in Coeur d’Alene, Twin Falls and Hailey in Idaho; Spokane, Wash.; Utah; and Missoula and Bozeman, Mont. “I am from Florida and we have always had hurricanes growing up, but I had never been in an earthquake,” Kurt Wisehart of Boise said. “This was the first time for me, which is why I walked out ’cause this is weird. Like, what’s everyone do?” Zach Borman of Meridian said he and his wife experienced nausea after the quake.  Spencer Tangen of the National Weather Service in Boise said it might not be unusual to feel aftershocks with an earthquake that size. So did McLean. “I’d just like the community to know that there is likely a very real possibility with a quake of that size that you’ll feel more,” McLean said. Savannah Brehmer, spokeswoman for FEMA Region 10, which includes Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, said you should not attempt to run outside or hide in a doorway during an earthquake. “Dropping, covering and holding on is the best action to take as soon as you realize an earthquake has hit,” Brehmer said. “That’s what’s going to keep your most precious organs safe from potential injury.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.

The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana, and Salt Lake City, Utah.  Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke’s Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn’t interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho’s coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation’s highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties. “It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said. The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.” Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it. “I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I’m sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.” Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay. That quake was along what scientists call a “normal fault,” with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday’s quake appeared to be on an unmapped “strike-slip fault,” causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line. “This is one that wasn’t obvious enough to be mapped before now,” Jones said. Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they’re less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists. Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake. “An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn’t surprise us,” she said. “They do every bit as much damage.” People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said. “Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,” Jones said. “Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake.

Kristin Murphy, Deseret News  SALT LAKE CITY — Utah Gov. Gary Herbert declared a state of emergency on Friday to deal with the aftermath of Wednesday’s magnitude 5.7 earthquake. He stressed that state resources are available and gave praise to first responders. “I’m tremendously proud of how first responders and officials on the city, county and state levels worked together to respond to Wednesday’s earthquakes,” Herbert said “We are grateful that we had no major injuries and no fatalities as a result of this quake, but now we need to focus on helping our communities repair damages. “This declaration will help in that effort by expediting the use of state resources, as well as federal resources, should they be needed.”  In the meantime, the Utah Department of Transportation expanded its inspection of bridges in the aftermath of the earthquake to include pedestrian and railroad infrastructure, completing a close-up look of all 705 structures by Friday afternoon.  “The good news is we have only had one bridge that we have had to close and divert traffic from,” said UDOT spokesman John Gleason. The closure is the Fort Union flyover ramp to westbound I-215, which will likely be inspected more thoroughly in the next couple of days. “We are just not taking any risks with the safety of the bridges,” Gleason said. He added that 18 bridges have been “yellow-flagged” for further inspection of minimal damage that appears to be cosmetic. “It is not anything we are concerned about with structural damage,” he said. “We really want to make sure we are going over these bridges with a fine-tooth comb to make sure we are addressing any issues from the earthquake.” Keith D. Koper, director of the University of Utah Seismograph Stations, said there have been an estimated 500 aftershocks since Wednesday morning’s earthquake centered near Magna, and the number is changing minute by minute.  While that number seems dramatic, Koper said the aftershocks are decreasing in strength and will likely continue for weeks. The good news, however, is the more they continue, the risk decreases. “It is less and less likely the longer we go that we will have a big damaging aftershock,” Koper said.  Structural engineers were continuing to assess the damage Friday at the Rio Grande Depot, where chunks of plaster fell to the floor. The depot houses the Utah Department of Heritage & Arts and includes an interior walkway to the south where a building is home to the state archives. Department spokesman Josh Loftin said the building continues to be closed due to concerns about more plaster falling off the walls. The basement houses the state’s collection of artifacts. A couple were toppled in the earthquake, but not damaged, he said. Most concerning is the long-held fear that an earthquake could have triggered the automatic sprinkling system, damaging the precious items. That did not happen. “We have been lucky and we were lucky this time there was not damage to the artifacts,” Loftin said. The Great Salt Lake State Park Marina also continues to be closed but is expected to reopen sometime next week. Park officials have been grappling with a pair of gas leaks, a water pipeline that broke and roadway cracks caused by the earthquake.  An American Red Cross evacuation center at Taylorsville High School was scheduled to close Friday evening. Any residents in need of assistance should call 1-800-REDCROSS. Tina Brown, spokeswoman for the Salt Lake County Division of Emergency Management, said the county is rolling out a damage assessment survey to cities for residents to fill out so officials can get a better grasp on the extent of the earthquake’s impacts. She added it could be months or even into next year before the county has an exact picture of what buildings suffered damage.  “It is a fluid situation,” she said. West Valley City, where 49 mobile homes were condemned as uninhabitable, has a grant program that offers assistance up to $1,000, a mobile home repair program that offers one time grant assistance up to $6,000 and home rehabilitation loans of up to $25,000 at low interest.

     The Utah Emergency Management Center reports there’s shaking near Salt Lake City, Utah after magnitude 5.7 earthquake hit the impacted area; 55,000 people are without power. Tens of thousands of people in Utah are without power after an earthquake rocked the Salt Lake City metro area early Wednesday, causing some damage and closing the city's airport. The U.S. Geological Survey said the 5.7-magnitude earthquake was reported just after 7 a.m., with an epicenter located three miles north-northeast of Magna, and it occurred at a depth of six miles. The temblor and its aftershocks rattled a region of approximately 2.8 million people who are already hunkered down amid the coronavirus epidemic. “This is extremely bad timing, because we already have the coronavirus issue going on right now causing a lot of anxiety,” Gov. Gary Herbert said at a news conference. Herbert said the temblor was ""felt across much of the state,"" urging residents to follow proper safety measures in the event of any additional aftershocks or quakes. ""Please stay away from the downtown area while crews assess damage,"" Herbert tweeted. ""Unless you work in public safety, or are an essential employee, remain at home or telework.""
