The mayor of Sparta, Wes Brinegar, issued a state of emergency on Sunday after a 5.1. earthquake that was felt across North Carolina rattled the town on Sunday. No injuries have been reported.   After the earthquake, the USGS reports that another three tremors at 2.2 magnitude hit the area.    Leading up to the 5.1 magnitude earthquake, USGS says the area felt five earlier tremors. On Saturday, the area was hit with 2.1 and 2.3 magnitude earthquakes, and on Sunday, USGS reports 2.3, 2.6 and 2.2 magnitude earthquakes. The mayor says the 5.1 magnitude earthquake caused widespread minor damage to homes in Sparta with structures and chimneys being knocked off.  He has been visiting homes and businesses throughout the day.  Many local business in Sparta were closed because of damage caused by the earthquake.  The town was under construction at the time the earthquake hit.  A streetscape project has been under construction for a year now. The mayor says if the 100 year-old waterline was still in the ground, it would have been disastrous. Three homes made of rock were damaged, and the three families living in the homes had to be relocated because the homes are no longer safe to live in after the earthquake moved them off the foundation by four to six inches.  As of Sunday, Sparta had felt up to 11 shakes since Saturday with four of them registering over 2.6 magnitude.  There were also six to seven minor shakes throughout Alleghany County Sunday afternoon. The mayor says the town is “not out of the woods yet.”   Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. Sunday’s 5.1 earthquake is the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. A viewer in Pfafftown told us, “Around 8 a.m. this morning, our bedroom shook. We thought a tree had fallen but then heard it was an earthquake.” Experts with the United States Geological Survey are telling people to “be ready for more earthquakes” since aftershocks will continue near the mainshock. “The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,” the website reads. Throughout next week, there is a 4 percent chance that one or more aftershocks will be larger than magnitude 5.1, according to the USGS forecast. Smaller earthquakes are more likely through next week. The chance of a magnitude 3 or higher earthquake is 56 percent. Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily. USGS experts say this earthquake could be part of a sequence.

Please enter a search term.       MEXICO CITY (AP) — A powerful earthquake centered near the southern Mexico resort of Huatulco killed at least four people, swayed buildings in Mexico City and sent thousands fleeing into the streets. Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed and another injured in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise he said reports were of minor damage from the magnitude 7.4 quake, including broken windows and collapsed walls. Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat later said a second person was killed in an apparent house collapse in the tiny mountain village of San Juan Ozolotepec.  Pemex also said the quake caused a fire at its refinery in the Pacific coast city of Salina Cruz, relatively near the epicenter. It said one worker was injured and the flames were quickly extinguished. Churches, bridges and highways also suffered damage during the quake. López Obrador said there had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out to some areas. Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Inside a Mexico City military barracks converted to COVID-19 hospital, medical staff suited in protective equipment tried to calm anxious patients. Unable to evacuate isolation areas, patients huddled under a large beam in the women’s ward while a nurse tried to calm one having a panic attack. Teresa Juárez could only wish for it to pass quickly from her hospital bed where she lay connected to oxygen. Diabetic and with high blood pressure, Juárez said she thought about her five children. “It’s horrible, you’re here and you don’t know what to do,” she said.  It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico. In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued. “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves three to 10 feet above tide levels along parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru and Ecuador. Guatemala’s national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea.

													Garcetti announcing earthquake. 						
					 Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s press conference was interrupted by an earthquake today. As he was speaking about the protests and getting tested for COVID-19, he learned about an 5.5 magnitude quake in the region.  And although he appeared calm while he was announcing it, he also added some commentary that is quickly going viral online. “As if things couldn’t get worse,” Garcetti said about the earthquake after announcing what had occurred.   The Mayor pretty much sums it up right now in LA. #earthquake pic.twitter.com/xGgVEzzRO4 — Niall Dalton (IRE) (@Stakeshorses) June 4, 2020     — MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) June 4, 2020    Mayor Garcetti saying “as if things couldn’t get worse” after an earthquake interrupted his press conference about coronavirus and thr protests. 😭💀 — Charles O'Keefe (@CharlesAOKeefe) June 4, 2020  Another person said that they thought the earthquake was a lot closer than it was based on what he said during the press conference. He announced it was in San Bernardino and was 5.7 on the Richter scale. Later estimates put the center of the quake at about 103 miles from San Bernardino. Garcetti at the time said they would support the people in San Bernardino after damage was assessed. Then he went back to discussing the importance of being tested for COVID-19.   — Jeff Pope (@JeffPopeRadio) June 4, 2020  Another person said they thought the announcement was fake at first because they couldn’t feel the earthquake.  I didn't feel it, but Eric Garcetti interrupted his BLM statement to talk about the earthquake and it felt like just a distraction from the matter at hand. I legit thought it was fake. haha — matt (@pineasaurus) June 4, 2020  The earthquake happened while many protesters were gathered in downtown Los Angeles.   — David Zahniser 🦅 (@DavidZahniser) June 4, 2020   Mayor Garcetti “uhhh i guess we just had an earthquake” as if things couldn’t get worse. #earthquake #riots #covid #lamayor pic.twitter.com/0Oryc7gUix — visadiva (@VISA_DIVA) June 4, 2020  Although the center of the quake was technically  117.5 miles south-southwest of Los Angeles, according to USGS, the 5.1 magnitude earthquake could still be felt by people in the city. Others tweeted the same feelings about the quake after it happened.

Pandemic kit has decimated earthquake kit! — Z Mann (@izacmann) June 4, 2020  Technically, the earthquake today was actually an aftershock of a Ridgecrest earthquake from nearly a year ago, experts said.   M 5.53 makes this the largest aftershock of the Ridgecrest sequence, nearly 1 year after it began. — Zachary Ross (@zross_) June 4, 2020   Why is this considered a Ridgecrest aftershock after almost a year? Because the rate of events per day is still way above the rate before the sequence started. — Zachary Ross (@zross_) June 4, 2020    Yes, an earthquake. A M5.5 at the very southern end of the 2019 Ridgecrest aftershock zone.  This is a large late aftershock – do you remember that I said these are common? — Dr. Lucy Jones (@DrLucyJones) June 4, 2020  Below is a map of the earthquake’s location, as shared by USGS.gov.

Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued. “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves three to 10 feet above tide levels along parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru and Ecuador. Guatemala’s national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea.

					 Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s press conference was interrupted by an earthquake today. As he was speaking about the protests and getting tested for COVID-19, he learned about an 5.5 magnitude quake in the region.  And although he appeared calm while he was announcing it, he also added some commentary that is quickly going viral online. “As if things couldn’t get worse,” Garcetti said about the earthquake after announcing what had occurred.

He announced it was in San Bernardino and was 5.7 on the Richter scale. Later estimates put the center of the quake at about 103 miles from San Bernardino. Garcetti at the time said they would support the people in San Bernardino after damage was assessed. Then he went back to discussing the importance of being tested for COVID-19.   — Jeff Pope (@JeffPopeRadio) June 4, 2020  Another person said they thought the announcement was fake at first because they couldn’t feel the earthquake.  I didn't feel it, but Eric Garcetti interrupted his BLM statement to talk about the earthquake and it felt like just a distraction from the matter at hand.

Sunday’s 5.1 earthquake is the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. A viewer in Pfafftown told us, “Around 8 a.m. this morning, our bedroom shook. We thought a tree had fallen but then heard it was an earthquake.” Experts with the United States Geological Survey are telling people to “be ready for more earthquakes” since aftershocks will continue near the mainshock. “The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,” the website reads. Throughout next week, there is a 4 percent chance that one or more aftershocks will be larger than magnitude 5.1, according to the USGS forecast. Smaller earthquakes are more likely through next week. The chance of a magnitude 3 or higher earthquake is 56 percent. Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily. USGS experts say this earthquake could be part of a sequence.

31,2.2M aftershock reported near Sparta following Sunday earthquake,2020-08-10 13:28 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/10/m-aftershock-reported-near-sparta-following-sunday-earthquake/,"(WBTV) - A 2.2 magnitude aftershock was reported near Sparta, North Carolina Monday, a day after a 5.1. magnitude earthquake rocked the area.   Earthquake experts earlier predicted aftershocks following Sunday’s earthquake, which was one of the largest quakes ever reported in the state.  Sparta is in Alleghany County, just east of Ashe County. There have been seven earthquakes around Sparta in the last two days. According to the United States Geological Survey’s aftershock forecast, aftershocks will continue to occur near the earthquake area. “The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,” the website reads. According to the USGS’ Sunday forecast, there is a 5 percent chance of one or more aftershocks that are larger than magnitude 5.1. If any aftershocks of this magnitude were to happen, it is most likely that as few as zero or as many as two such earthquakes may occur. It is more likely that there will be smaller earthquakes over the next week. The chance of an earthquake of magnitude 3 or higher is 57 percent, and it is most likely that as few as zero or as many as 57 such earthquakes may occur in the case that the sequence is re-invigorated by a larger aftershock. Magnitude 3 and above earthquakes are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily. When there are more earthquakes, the chance of a large earthquake is greater which means that the chance of damage is greater. According to USGS, this earthquake could be part of a sequence.  The chance of an earthquake of magnitude 6 or higher is one in 200, such an earthquake is possible but with a low probability. The chance of an earthquake of magnitude 7 or higher is one in 2,000, such an earthquake is possible but with a low probability.  USGS officials say their earthquake forecasts give them an understanding of the chances of having more earthquakes within a given time period in the affected area. They calculate this earthquake forecast using a statistical analysis based on past earthquakes. The forecast changes as time passes due to decline in the frequency of aftershocks, larger aftershocks that may trigger further earthquakes, and changes in forecast modeling based on the data collected for this earthquake sequence.

The mayor says there is widespread minor damage to homes with structures and chimneys being knocked off.  He has been visiting homes and businesses throughout the day.  Many local business in Sparta are closed because of damage caused by the earthquake.  The town was under construction at the time the earthquake hit.  A streetscape project has been under construction for a year now. The mayor says if the 100 year-old waterline was still in the ground, it would have been disastrous. Three homes made of rock were damaged, and the three families living in the homes had to be relocated because the homes are no longer safe to live in after the earthquake moved them off the foundation by four to six inches.  Sparta has felt up to 11 shakes since yesterday with four of them registering over 2.6 magnitude.  There have also been six to seven minor shakes throughout Allegheny County this afternoon. The mayor says the town is “not out of the woods yet.”   Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds.

SPARTA, N.C. — The damage left behind after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck Sparta on Aug. 9 was worse than initially thought, according to the Town of Sparta.  “We are hearing continuous rumbles throughout our community here in town and in Alleghany County, but we thank the Good Lord to this day that there have been no injuries or fatalities,” Mayor Wes Brinegar said during a Tuesday news conference. While damage assessments are still ongoing, the Town of Sparta had received about 525 reports of damage as of the close of business Monday, Emergency Management Director Daniel Shoffner said. 60 of these cases have been categorized as “major damage,” meaning they lost 40% or more in value. “We underestimated the damage and that was the number one thing. We were looking for major damage in our initial reports, but now, it’s coming out more and more with damage more widespread and severe,” Brinegar said. Brinegar said many of the people living in Sparta, especially those in the older population, are dealing with the emotional trauma that comes with having a natural disaster. And having 20 aftershocks since the earthquake hasn’t helped. “We’re still getting those aftershocks and those loud booms periodically. A lot of people are on edge right now and a lot of people have those issues because they’re paranoid right now,” Brinegar said. The Estep sisters didn’t return back to even look at the damage until Tuesday — more than a week after the quake. They own three side-by-side properties that have all been deemed unlivable. “Our parents were here first and all total 54 years,” Mary Estep said. In those 54 years, a lot of memories have been made there. “All the Christmas’ all the holidays, birthday, Thanksgiving was here,” Mary Estep said. In a matter of seconds, everything changed. “All of a sudden it was like a bomb went off. Everything was flying and shaking, and it was terrifying. Only thing I was thinking was, ‘I got to get her out of the kitchen,’” Mary Estep said. As the quake shook photos, books and home décor off the walls and shelves, she was in the living room frantically trying to get to her sister Alice Estep. “She was yelling ‘get out, get out.’ And I was saying ‘I’m right here, I’m right here,’” Alice Estep said. Hanging on to one another, the two women made it to the door only to find that it was blocked from the outside. A neighbor was able to get them out. They own these two homes and the apartments in the middle. All three properties are beyond repair. “This is a loss completely to us. We just don’t know where to turn, or what to do,” Alice Estep said. While it’s going to take months for some people, cleanup efforts have begun for those who’ve documented their damages. The emergency management report for damage assessment has been sent to state officials. “We are very much relying on state and federal officials to help put the people in this county,” said Daniel Roten, Alleghany County Emergency Management coordinator. He’s hopeful the county will get some money to assist individuals in this time of need. “As its been mentioned before, no one here had earthquake insurance — maybe a handful. I can count them on one hand,” Roten said. Unfortunately, with every tragedy, Brinegar said it seems like there’s someone trying to profit off of it. He said scammers are creating GoFundMe pages asking people to donate. The Red Cross is now housing 19 people from 10 families. The city doesn’t have an official GoFundMe for the victims. Brinegar said all assistance will go through the American Red Cross and they do have a fund called “Sparta Alleghany County North Carolina Earthquake.” Shoffner says the school system did sustain some damage during the earthquake. The school system has taken the necessary steps to ensure the safety of students and faculty.  The area felt eight tremors before the earthquake, as well as 20 aftershocks. The 5.1 earthquake centered in Sparta was felt across North Carolina.  Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds. The 5.1 magnitude earthquake in Sparta was the strongest earthquake to happen in North Carolina since 1916. Yup, that sure was what you thought you felt.Please do not call 911 simply to report the #earthquake. Only call if you need assistance.  By far the largest quake in North Carolina since a M 5.2 in 1916. #Earthquake pic.twitter.com/J3yuTrdSq5 Developing…

82,University of Memphis sends researchers to study North Carolina earthquake,2020-08-14 17:16 UTC,https://www.wxii12.com/article/university-memphis-research-study-north-carolina-earthquake/33607175,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. Just days after a historic 5.1 magnitude earthquake hit the state of North Carolina, some scientists and other officials are on the ground in the Sparta, North Carolina, area. Folks from the University of Memphis’ Center for Earthquake Research and Information are working with the USGS and other state officials, trying to learn more about the quake.   A geologist with the University of Memphis's Center for Earthquake Research and Information told WXII 12 News, while big events like what happened Sunday are rare, the data collected can help keep people safe.  Hours after the 5.1 magnitude earthquake rattled the state, scientists and others were on the ground in the Sparta area trying to gather as much information as possible.   “What was the fault that ruptured and how big is it? Will it rupture again? So the aftershock data allow us to capture some of the information on the size of that fault and its location and its orientation,” said Gary Patterson, a geologist and the Director of Education and Outreach at the Center for Earthquake Research and Information at the University of Memphis. The initial quake damaged hundreds of buildings, but no one was seriously hurt. Geologist Gary Patterson with the University of Memphis’s Center for Earthquake Research and Information, or CERI, said a team was sent to the area to use four portable seismograph stations like this one below. “These are very high-quality, battery-charged, solar-powered computers in a can that can have a very high dynamic range. They can stay on scale even when the vibrations are very large or very small,” said Patterson. So far, Patterson said they have been able to locate 12-14 aftershocks following the main-shock and eight foreshocks.   “It’ll tell us more about the source characteristics of the seismic sources in your area. And that can go into building codes and especially for critical facilities, roads, bridges, nuclear power plants, wastewater treatment plants,” he said. Patterson said while earthquakes like these occur less frequently in this part of the country, he says understanding the science behind the quake can help both the state and federal government prepare for the next big seismic event.  CERI says the 5.1 earthquake on Aug. 9 was the largest event to have occurred in this area since 1916.

The shaking was felt all the way in Southern California. FRESNO, Calif. -- A preliminary magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the eastern part of Central California Wednesday morning, according to the USGS. The temblor was reported in the Owens Valley, south of the town of Lone Pine on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  Residents across Central California reported feeling the quake, as did people in some parts of Northern and Southern California. Waves were felt in the Los Angeles basin, 200 miles away from the epicenter. Clovis resident, Ashley Rios, shared a photo with us of a crack in the tile of her home caused by the earthquake. Footage from a grocery store in Lone Pine showed a mess - cans were strewn on the floor and broken glass was everywhere. Lone Pine sits in a gigantic trough between two ranges of the Sierra Nevadas. It is here in the Owens Valley that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power aqueduct is situated to supply mountain water to Los Angeles. LADWP said engineers are examining the dams and waterways following the quake. So far, there have been no reports of damage. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said that the Owens Valley quake is in the same location that a M 4.6 quake was felt two nights ago. That smaller, earlier quake is now considered a foreshock to Wednesday's quake. Wednesday's quake sent hearts racing in Ridgecrest, where a flurry of shocks, as strong as 7.1, hit last year around the Fourth of July. ""This is a different fault than the Ridgecrest earthquake, and it's far enough away that it doesn't fall within the traditional definition of aftershocks. Rather, we would look at it as its own earthquake,"" Jones said. In the minutes after the magnitude 5.8 earthquake, there were more than a half a dozen aftershocks, ranging from M 2.5 up to M 4.6. As for the statistical chance of a greater earthquake in the area, Jones said with every quake, there is a 5% chance of something bigger.

The Scripture quite literally came to life for several Catholic churches in North Carolina as a rare earthquake rattled portions of the state over the weekend. According to a news release from the Diocese of Charlotte, Father Richard Sutter of St. Gabriel’s Catholic Church said the lector in the Sunday service had just reached the 19th chapter of 1 Kings, a Bible passage referring to the prophet Elijah, which said, “After the wind there was an earthquake — but the LORD was not in the earthquake.”  It was then that parishioners felt the 5.1 magnitude earthquake centered near Sparta, the most powerful to hit the state in more than 100 years.  Images on social media also showed items knocked off of grocery store shelves. The Charlotte Observer reported that while he didn’t feel it himself, Sutter said parishioners came up to him as soon as the service ended. He said the moment can be a lesson for the times. “When there’s fear from an earthquake, when there’s fear from a storm, when there’s fear from a pandemic and uncertainty ... you have to let the Lord speak to us the truth,” he said. “Let’s keep our eyes on Jesus Christ and not the waves (or even earthquakes) we cannot control,” he said. Father Cory Catron, pastor of the Catholic mission in Sparta, said his church suffered no apparent damage from the quake. “Made for good homily material, though,” the news release said. In his homily, Catron joked about being worried the next thing would be fire. He called the events a reminder of God’s presence, adding “we must not be distracted by the noise and problems of the world around us, but listen for His voice in the stillness.”  He said, “The ceiling creaked for like three seconds, and everybody kind of looked up and immediately we knew what it was.”  Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.","According to a news release from the Diocese of Charlotte, Father Richard Sutter of St. Gabriel’s Catholic Church said the lector in the Sunday service had just reached the 19th chapter of 1 Kings, a Bible passage referring to the prophet Elijah, which said, “After the wind there was an earthquake — but the LORD was not in the earthquake.”  It was then that parishioners felt the 5.1 magnitude earthquake centered near Sparta, the most powerful to hit the state in more than 100 years.

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is in Sparta Tuesday afternoon to survey damage to businesses and homes   from the historic, 5.1 magnitude earthquake that hit on Sunday.  Cooper met with homeowners, along with local and county officials to view damage. Sunday's quake is the powerful one to hit North Carolina in more than 100 years. It shook much of the state early Sunday, rattling homes, businesses and residents.  “We’ve dealt with a hurricane a tornado and now a violent earthquake all in the middle of a pandemic,"" said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper.  “It looks like somebody when threw and trashed this house. Everything is off the wall. All the cabinets have emptied into the floor,” said Steve Severt whose wife's aunts house was damaged in Sparta. And while there were very few injuries, people said they are hoping for some kind of relief from the state or the federal government to help many people in the area who do not have earthquake insurance. “I’m hoping that we can find some kind of program that can come in and help the citizens of the area,” said homeowner Mike Parlier. Mike Sprayberry, the NC Emergency Management Director said he believes help, may not be far behind. “When we here that there’s damages to up to 200 structures and then 15 homes that are completely uninhabitable we do think there is a good chance that we could find a program that we could implement in the county,” said Sprayberry. As the community of Sparta continues to asses the damage and cleanup. The Sheriff of Alleghany County is asking folks who have damage to report to the Sheriff’s Office. They are also putting together a list of volunteers to help with the cleanup. There were no reports of serious injuries, but some minor structural damage was reported in Sparta, as well as cracks in roads. Images on social media also showed items knocked off of grocery store shelves. The U.S. Geological Survey said on its website that there are chances for one or more aftershocks in the next week, forecasting a 45% chance for earthquakes of magnitude 3 or greater.  The chances of another quake as strong as the one on Sunday or greater was about 1%, the geological survey said.

Cleanup continues more than a week after a historic 5.1 magnitude earthquake rocked our state.  On Tuesday, officials gave an update on the damage.  More than a week after an intense earthquake quake hit, sisters Alice Estep and Mary Estep Crouse said the sound of destruction is still fresh in their minds. “It sounded like the house was blowing up. Everything was moving everything was falling and she was screaming get out of here get out of here,” said Alice Estep whose home was damaged by the earthquake. But instead of an explosion, the two sisters who had lived inside this home for nearly 55 years experienced the strongest earthquake to hit this area in more than 100 years.  “It was like the house was going like this twisting and things were dropping and we were hearing loud drops and we knew we had to get out” said Alice. The quake hit their home – making it uninhabitable. Emergency officials said 10 families have been displaced and reports of damage are still coming in.  “As far as the functioning of the building and everything nothing was that injured. It just has you concerned when you see cracks in these gigantic rocks,” said Dr. Rob Klingensmith whose business was damaged. And as geologists and researchers continue to learn more about what happened, the mayor of Sparta is pleading for help.   “The elderly population here cannot afford to fix their homes because insurance is not going to cover it. Don’t forget about Sparta and Alleghany County,” said Mayor Wes Brinegar.  And as folks continue to clean up the damage the Sheriff of Alleghany County is asking for volunteers to help clean up.

It left a significant amount of damage downtown with bricks falling off several buildings. “We had gotten woken up by a boom a little after two and couldn’t go back to sleep,” said Jacob Church, a resident of Sparta. The town was rocked early Sunday morning by a 5.1 magnitude earthquake that no one saw coming. “At first it was like, ‘What’s going on?’ None of us were injured. I think it’s a cool thing to be a part of that,” said Brandon Lineberry who was visiting at the time. The quake rattling a cemetery so hard, it uprooted headstones from the ground. Just a few miles from downtown the North Carolina Department of Transportation was dealing with the damage to a water main. “We’re just trying to get it back open. It’s buckled up the road a little from the water main, from the earthquake, and we’re just trying to get it back to normal,” said Jeffery Jones with the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The damage was significant at Scott’s Landscaping Nursery and Farms, leaving several cracks in the parking lot and shattering pottery. “It’s been a rough morning. You don’t expect anything like this to happen here because it doesn’t happen here. 2020 has been a rough year for a lot of people,” said Scott Smith, owner of Scott’s Landscaping Nursery and Farms. The emergency management team says residents should call the local sheriff’s department to report any major damage.

         PACOIMA (CBSLA) -- A 4.2-magnitude earthquake struck the Pacoima area of the San Fernando Valley early Thursday morning and was felt across the Southland. It was followed up by two large aftershocks.  The earthquake was initially recorded as a 4.5, but later downgraded to a 4.2. It struck at a depth of 4.9 miles. It was felt as far south as San Diego and as far north as Bakersfield, people reported to the USGS. ""I really thought, like, my son fell off the bed or something,"" Pacoima resident Robert Legaspi told CBSLA. ""So I get up. So, my wife has an app that alerted, but it was a nice shake.""   Renowned seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones called Thursday's temblors of the ""garden variety."" The earthquake occurred in the Sierra Madre Fault Zone, said Paul Caruso with the USGS in a virtual briefing. By late morning, more than 60 aftershocks had been detected, Caltech seismologist Jen Andrews said. Andrews said the temblor is not surprising, given the array of fault zones in the area. She noted that Thursday morning's shaker occurred at the intersection of faults responsible for the 1971 San Fernando earthquake and the 1994 Northridge quake, but there was no way to draw any connection with those events. There were no reports of injuries or significant damage, the Los Angeles Fire Department reported. LAFD engaged its Earthquake Emergency Mode, with fire engines and helicopters canvassing its 470 square-mile jurisdiction. Caltrans was also sending crews around the region to ensure that no bridges had been damaged as well. This appears to be the most strongly felt earthquake in the region since a pair of earthquakes struck the Kern County region of Ridgecrest and Searles Valley in the Mohave Desert on consecutive days in July of 2019. On the morning of July 4, 2019, the region was hit by a magnitude 6.4 quake, the largest to hit Southern California in 20 years. However, that turned out to only be a foreshock to the main shock, the magnitude 7.1 earthquake which struck on the night of July 5, ten times larger than the 6.4 quake.

The earthquake was centered 60 miles, or 98 kilometers, south-southeast, of Perryville, Alaska, according to the US Geological Survey. The quake is considered shallow at about six miles, or 10 kilometers, deep.  “Anything below 70 kilometers is considered a shallow quake,” CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. “That’s important, because shallow earthquakes often cause the most damage, compared to the ones that are deeper, regardless of the strength.”  Earthquakes are more likely to develop into tsunamis if they are high in magnitude, are shallow, and are thrust earthquakes rather than strike slip earthquakes, according to the USGS. Quakes between magnitudes 7.6 to 7.8 have the potential to produce destructive tsunamis.

249,7.4 magnitude earthquake hits southern Mexico; at least 5 dead,2020-06-24 05:50 UTC,https://www.myarklamiss.com/news/international/7-4-magnitude-earthquake-hits-southern-mexico-at-least-5-dead/,"KTVE - myarklamiss.com Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.     Mexico (CNN) (06/24/20)– A 7.4 magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico’s southern coastline on Tuesday, collapsing buildings and prompting evacuations, has left at least five people dead, officials said.  At least five people were killed, according to the coordinator for Mexico’s National Civil Protection Service. Oaxaca state Gov. Alejandro Murat said a 22-year-old woman and a man were among the dead. The Oaxacan Health Services also reported damages from the quake to general hospitals in Pochutla, Puerto Escondido and Pinotepa Nacional and a few community hospitals in other areas.  According to Murat, two of the hospitals with damages have been dealing with coronavirus patients. “We are verifying [damages] because this hospital is also tending Covid cases on the Oaxacan coast,” he said on a radio interview with Radio Fórmula. The severity of the damages are not specified. The National Civil Protection Service reported the first death after a structure collapsed after the earthquake, which occurred just east of the popular tourist destination Huatulco. Authorities also reported a power outage throughout the state’s capital and damages to the exterior of a hospital in Oaxaca. The earthquake could be felt as far as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. In capital Mexico City, approximately 190 miles north of the epicenter, tremors were felt and sirens were heard wailing. Tsunami waves of 0.68 meters (2.2 ft) were observed in Acapulco and 0.71 meters (2.3 ft) in Salina Cru.  An earlier tsunami warning was revised down, according to the U.S. Tsunami Warning System, forecasting possible waves of up to a meter (3.3 ft). The damage in Oaxaca state is considered light to moderate, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) ShakeMap. Estimates modeled by the USGS suggest that localized casualties and damage are possible but there are likely to be fewer than 100 fatalities and less than $100 million in damage.  However, the model only includes earthquake shaking, and not any impacts from potential tsunamis on the coastline. The USGS said that recent earthquakes in the area have caused secondary hazards such as tsunamis and landslides. Earlier estimates put the magnitude of the earthquake at 7.7, but that has been revised down to 7.4 (and additional revisions are possible). Mexico is one of the world’s most seismically active regions and has a long history of devastating earthquakes. The country is located on top of three large tectonic plates and their movement causes regular quakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. In 2017, two powerful earthquakes hit the country in two weeks, toppling buildings, cracking highways, and killing hundreds of people. One had a magnitude of 7.1 and the other a magnitude of 8.1. Mexico City is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes because its very soft and wet ground amplifies shaking and is prone to liquefaction, in which dirt transforms into a dense liquid when sufficiently churned.

Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C.—Sparta has less than 2,000 residents, but it’s been the talk of the east coast after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake shook the town and its surroundings on Sunday morning.  On Monday, people were holding off on clean up and assessing the damage caused by the natural disaster in hopes of documenting it for future financial assistance.  For a lot of people in North Carolina, earthquakes are not covered under what’s called the “umbrella clause” for natural disasters.  Sparta Mayor Wes Brinegar said the state of emergency was called so they can apply for FEMA and state financial aid.  The VFW is one of those businesses that’s going to need quite a bit of assistance.  “It’s kind of heartbreaking to see this history destroyed by an earthquake like this,” Brinegar said.  The Post Commander, Gary Adkins, is hoping this wont stop the positive momentum the post had already started prior to the natural disaster.   He described the damages the building sustained.  “Here the ceiling is falling in on us and several tiles are falling out on the back side,” he said.  The jolt started in Sparta and was felt throughout the Piedmont Triad all the way to Atlanta. “I thought bomb. I thought maybe something exploded — gas explosion or something. It was just so loud,” Clark Hunter, VFW Post 7034 member said.  The 5.1 magnitude earthquake caused severe damage to homes and businesses in Sparta. The VFW was less than a mile from its epicenter.  “It (the earthquake) opened up all the drawers. It knocked microwaves off the counters. All dishes came out of the drawers,” Adkins explained.  “Our local VFW…sustained probably some of the most severe damages that we had,” Brinegar said.  Mayor Brinegar is a veteran and member of this post. He became emotional when talking about the post’s significance to the town.  “One of our most historic buildings here in the county. It’s been here since WWII,” he said.  There was also significant damage to the Kathy Shore Tree Nursery.  Owner Kathy shore has owned the building for about a decade, and seeing it like this was devastating to walk into Monday morning.  “We have found out that the earthquake is less than a mile from here. So this evidently took a direct hit,” she said.  Shore said it’s going to cost more than a couple hundred thousand dollars to fix all the damages.  It’s another hurdle after the pandemic threatened the businesses on her property.  “We had been shutdown for a while. We had reopened and business was doing very well. It was booming up here,” Shore said. “We had lots of regulations set in place, and people seem to be following it. And everything was back open and going well until this hit.”   A lot of people are reaching out to the business asking if they can help. But all the places FOX8 spoke to say they are waiting for insurance inspectors to asses the situation before they begin clean up.  The VFW and Kath’s Nursery are places that may need some rebuilding or renovating at the least. The question now is how?  “Right now, to our knowledge, this is not covered by any kind of insurance policies, so it has to be a specific thing. So we’re going to have a lot of people looking for a lot of help,” Brinegar said.  While this organization is leaving everything how it is so inspectors can take a look at the damages, picking up the pieces is something members at Post 7034 won’t have to do alone.  VFW State Commander Victor Letourneaut drove the more than 5 hours from Jacksonville, North Carolina to make sure his brothers in arms could feel the support after a devastating 24-hours.  “That’s the stuff that we do. Someone’s down, you’re always going to get people come back and reinforce you,” Letourneaut said. “Moral support. Financial support…right now it’s moral support, making sure everything is good to go. No one got hurt. That’s the great thing. Everything else we can rebuild,” he said.  Letournet said VFW members across the state have reached out saying they are willing and ready to assist this post when the time comes. Meantime, this post is hoping to get financial aid through the National VFW chapter.  Another thing that brings concern are the aftershocks of the initial earthquake.   While this natural disaster has put Sparta on the map, the mayor hopes people know this community is still standing strong together.  “Our people are the best people. People have come out and checked on each other…I’m so pleased and so honored to be the mayor of Sparta,” he said.  The mayor is encouraging all residents to send in photos of structural damages to emergency management.

There was a 5.2 magnitude earthquake reported near Skyland, NC in 1916. “I about fell off my bed. That’s how hard it hit,” said Sparta resident Jose Perez. “Everything started shaking. I started bouncing off of the bed, and then it stopped. It went on for 10 seconds before it stopped.” The seismograph at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg recorded the earthquake’s shaking. Once the shaking commenced, residents in Sparta witnessed the remnants of the earthquake’s force. Numerous roads in the city were split open, including well-traveled Route 21, and several homes and businesses experienced structural damage. “I cried for about 30 minutes this morning trying to clean up a bad mess,” said Scott Smith, whose Sparta-based landscaping and nursery business experienced cracking concrete and shattered items in the earthquake. “This is not about politics, coronavirus, or anything else. This is God showing you what he’s willing to do.” The earthquake even caught Alleghany County (NC) Sheriff Bryan Maines off-guard. “I actually woke up with the crashing of picture frames in my house.” Although the town experienced numerous reports of damage after the tremors, Maines said his office had not received any calls for serious injuries caused by the earthquake. “For the size and magnitude of this, it was not as bad as it could have been, so we’re really thankful,” Maines said. Smith said as long as everyone survived the earthquake, he can reminisce on the ten seconds that shook Sparta to its core. “My son on the way to town said, ‘Dad, what are we going to do?’” Smith said. “I told him, ‘You’re sitting next to me.

“I actually woke up with the crashing of picture frames in my house.” Although the town experienced numerous reports of damage after the tremors, Maines said his office had not received any calls for serious injuries caused by the earthquake.
Smith said as long as everyone survived the earthquake, he can reminisce on the ten seconds that shook Sparta to its core.

The quake sparked a tsunami warning for south Alaska and the Alaskan Peninsula, but the warning, as well as other advisories, were canceled later Wednesday morning, CNN reported. A wave of less than a foot was reported to have hit the state in Sand Point, The Associated Press reported.    — USGS (@USGS) July 22, 2020  Kodiak Police Sgt. Mike Sorter said early Wednesday that there were “no reports of any damage,” according to the AP. Kodiak is about 200 miles northeast of where the earthquake hit. “No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal,” he said. Small towns within 100 miles of the earthquake experienced strong shaking, and those near Anchorage — which is more than 500 miles away — reported some shaking, according to Michael West, an Alaska state seismologist.  The earthquake caused several people who live near the coast to evacuate to higher ground in anticipation of a potential tsunami as sirens blasted. Thrust earthquakes that reach high magnitudes and are categorized as shallow are more likely to produce tsunamis, with those between 7.6 and 7.8 having the potential to formulate “destructive tsunamis,” according to the USGS.  CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri reported at least 11 aftershocks have occurred, reaching magnitudes of between 3.9 and 6.1.  Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

Everything is nominal.” The quake triggered tsunami warning for a South Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands that was called off early Wednesday about two hours after the quake. Tsunami warning sirens could be heard blaring in videos posted on social media as residents heeded warnings to evacuate. On Kodiak Island, the local high school opened its doors for evacuees, as did the local Catholic school, the Anchorage Daily New s reported. “We’ve got a high school full of people,"" said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. ""I’ve been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,” he told the Daily News. ""Everything’s as calm as can be. We’ve got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,” he said. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later called off the tsunami threat for other U.S. and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America as well. “There was actually even no reported wave activity for our area,” Sorter said of the tsunami that was eventually canceled. According to the USGS, since 1900 there have been six other earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 and higher within 155 miles of Tuesday's quake. The largest of those was a 8.2 quake in 1938. The Alaska-Aleutian Trench was also where a magnitude 9.2 quake in 1964 was centered.

         LONE PINE (CBS SF) -- More than a dozen aftershocks to continued to ramble through the eastern Sierra near Mount Whitney Thursday, forcing rangers to delay searching for possible victims and assessing the damage done to several popular hiking trails by a 5.8 earthquake that rocked the region.  While it caused little damage to structures in the rural region, the quake did rock the Whitney Portal campground area. It has been followed by more than two dozen aftershocks over the last 24 hours ranging in magnitude from 4.6 to 2.5. The aftershocks delayed efforts to search for possible victims Thursday morning. Rangers said no one has been reported missing but the area is extremely popular with hikers. There were 40 vehicles in the parking area near the Whitney Portal campgrounds at the time of the quake. ""After an evaluation by a U.S. Forest Service geologist this morning, the intention is to send in search and rescue teams and canines to check each of the debris fields,"" according to a release by the Inyo County Sheriff's Department.  Search and rescue teams would focus on several areas of park. ""Aerial reconnaissance, as well as reports from hikers identified several additional slides,"" the sheriff department said. ""One directly above Lone Pine Lake, one about a quarter of a mile above Long Pine Lake near the main trail and there were three slides on Mt. Whitney...It is unclear if the Mt. Whitney Trail has been damaged."" Inyo County deputies did evacuate the popular Whitney Portal campground after the quake. Deputies also posted on social media that Horseshoe Meadows Road was closed due to rocks and debris. The Whitney Portal is the gateway to Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States and is the trailhead for the Mount Whitney Trail.  The quake was felt as far away as Bakersfield, Stockton and throughout the Central Valley.

Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru and Ecuador. Guatemala's national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high.

         SACRAMENTO (CBS / AP) — California's earthquake early warnings will be a standard feature on all Android phones, bypassing the need for users to download the state's MyShake app in order to receive alerts, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services said. The state worked with the U.S. Geological Survey and Google, the maker of Android, to build the quake alerts into all phones that run the commonplace operating system. The deal was expected to be announced Tuesday. ""This announcement means that California's world-class earthquake early warning system will be a standard function on every Android phone — giving millions precious seconds to drop, cover and hold on when the big one hits,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. The technology does not predict earthquakes. It is designed to quickly take data from seismic sensors and send warnings to potentially affected areas if a quake of magnitude 4.5 or greater occurs and if the projected shaking at a particular location is at a certain level of intensity. The MyShake technology was developed by the University of California, Berkeley, and released in 2019. Last December, the system sent out its first early warning to users, notifying them about a magnitude 4.3 earthquake in Central California. Warnings produced by the ShakeAlert system are also pushed through the wireless notification system that issues Amber Alerts, meaning some people receive both notifications. © Copyright 2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Please enter a search term.       RIDGECREST, Calif. – A magnitude 5.8 earthquake has struck a remote area of central California.   Veteran seismologist Lucy Jones says the quake occurred in the same location as a magnitude-4.6 quake that hit on Monday night. Jones says the earlier tremor is now considered a foreshock. In his Wednesday remarks on COVID-19, Gov. Gavin Newsom made mention of the quake in that “Mother Nature made sure we were reminded of her fury.” “Almost a year ago in two weeks, we had a major earthquake in the state of California — Ridgecrest,” Newsom said. “Just about 20 minutes ago, we experienced another trembler — just 5.8 on the Richter scale — but enough to remind all of us of our responsibilities as Californians, our vulnerabilities as Californians as it relates to the issue of earthquakes.”

Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed and another injured in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise he said reports were of minor damage from the magnitude 7.4 quake, including broken windows and collapsed walls. Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat later said a second person was killed in an apparent house collapse in the tiny mountain village of San Juan Ozolotepec. The state-run oil company known as Pemex said the quake caused a fire at its refinery in the Pacific coast city of Salina Cruz, relatively near the epicenter. It said one worker was injured and the flames were quickly extinguished. López Obrador said there had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out to some areas. Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Inside a Mexico City military barracks converted to COVID-19 hospital, medical staff suited in protective equipment tried to calm anxious patients. Unable to evacuate isolation areas, patients huddled under a large beam in the women's ward while a nurse tried to calm one having a panic attack. Teresa Juárez could only wish for it to pass quickly from her hospital bed where she lay connected to oxygen. Diabetic and with high blood pressure, Juárez said she thought about her five children. “It's horrible, you're here and you don't know what to do,” she said.  It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico. In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued.  “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking.  The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves three to 10 feet above tide levels along parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru and Ecuador. Guatemala's national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea. __ Associated Press writers Chris Torchia in Mexico City and Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.

 A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck near the Alaskan peninsula late Tuesday, shaking buildings, but there were no immediate reports of injuries and the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center canceled an earlier warning of potentially hazardous waves. In Kodiak, the largest community in the earthquake area on an island south of Anchorage, some residents posted video on social media of people walking up to the high school, which was serving as a shelter, and of sirens sounding alarms. The quake struck off the coast, 105 km (65 miles) south-south east of Perryville, Alaska at a depth of 28 km, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). It had prompted the Tsunami Warning Center to issue a warning for the coastal areas of south Alaska, the Alaskan Peninsula and Aleutian Islands.  Jeremy Zidek, spokesman for the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said emergency officials were trying to contact people in all the affected communities. The closest is Sand Point, a town of about 1,000 on another island off the tip of the Alaskan Peninsula. Sand Point has evacuated and sounded its emergency sirens, Zidek said. ""I believe that there's some damage from the shaking, but they have not been able to confirm that,"" he said. He added he had heard no reports of serious injuries. Other towns had sounded their alarms and started evacuations, he said. It was unclear what damage may have occurred. ""Tomorrow they'll get up and take stock of the damage in their communities,"" said Zidek. ""They can't see anything in the dark, anyway."" In Homer, a Kenai Peninsula town of about 5,800 people, residents in low-lying areas were told to use the city's high school as a shelter, according to local public radio there. Public radio showed a short video of cars streaming from the beach spit to higher ground.

USGS initially listed the magnitude as 6.1 and the epicenter at a GPS point about 20 miles southwest of Lone Pine in the Sierra Nevada range.  But the agency’s updated quake information downgraded the magnitude and indicated the epicenter was in the mostly dry Owens Lake bed, about 10 miles south-southeast of Lone Pine. The location is the center of the Owens Valley and the site of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power water facilities. The Los Angeles Aqueduct, which sends water to the city of L.A.’s more than 4 million residents, is just a few miles from the epicenter. It wasn’t immediately clear if any equipment was damaged. The aqueduct, more than a century old, has survived many earthquakes.   Lone Pine, a town of about 2,000 residents, is known in part for the nearby filming of many classic western films. In 1872, Lone Pine was largely destroyed and many residents were killed in an earthquake that’s now believed to be a magnitude 7.4, one of the largest in recorded California history. Wednesday’s temblor prompted reports of a rockslide and debris on two main roads that lead into the mountains, the Inyo County Sheriff’s Office said on Facebook. Local Sierra Wave radio reported little immediate damage, though a cleanup was in the works at a Lone Pine hardware store. The quake was felt throughout Central California and parts of Southern California. The more than 10,000 respondents to USGS’s “Did You Feel It?” page indicated they experienced the temblor in Las Vegas, Reno and the San Francisco Bay Area as well. Several aftershocks shook the area, including one with a 4.6 magnitude, according to USGS. The quake struck in the same location as a magnitude 4.6 temblor earlier in the week, famed seismologist Lucy Jones said on Twitter. That earthquake is now considered a foreshock, she said. We just had a M5.8 south of Lone Pine in the Owens Valley. It is the same location as the M4.6 two nights ago. That is now considered a foreshock Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

         LONE PINE (CBS SF) -- A 5.8 magnitude earthquake rattled Inyo County near the eastern Sierra Nevada town of Lone Pine Wednesday, sending tons of boulders and debris crashing down at the Whitney Portal camping area.  The Into County Sheriff's Department posted on Facebook that they have closed the popular camping spot. ""The campgrounds are being evacuated due to rockslide south of the main parking lot,"" the post read. ""No injuries were reported at this time... It is believed that this slide was triggered by the recent 5.8 earthquake near the Lone Pine area.""

Deputies did post that Horseshoe Meadows Road was closed due to rocks and debris. ""I was in that parking lot when it happened,"" Christine Defendi posted on Facebook along with a photo of the large dust cloud kicked up by the slide. The Whitney Portal is the gateway to Mt. Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States and is the trailhead for the Mt. Whitney Trail.   It has been followed by more than a dozen aftershocks ranging in magnitude from 4.6 to 2.5. On Monday night, the same area was struck by a 4.6-magnitude temblor.  There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries elsewhere. The quake was felt as far away as Bakersfield, Stockton and throughout the Central Valley.

765,Preliminary magnitude 7.8 earthquake strikes off coast of Alaska,2020-07-22 14:16 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/22/us/alaska-7-8-magnitude-earthquake/index.html,"
      An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck off southern Alaska’s coast late Tuesday, shaking the Alaska Peninsula and briefly sparking tsunami concerns before officials said no destructive waves were coming.
   
      The earthquake was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles southeast of Perryville on the sparsely populated Alaska Peninsula, striking around 10:12 p.m. local time (2:12 a.m. Wednesday ET).
   
      The Alaska Peninsula protrudes from mainland Alaska and is flanked to the southwest by the Aleutian Islands. 
    
      The warning sent people to higher ground in cities like Sand Point, an island community of about 1,000 people off the peninsula, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
   
      People in Sand Point gathered at a high school until shortly after midnight, when officials gave an all-clear, Jordan Keeler, an Anchorage-based city administrator, told the newspaper.
   
      “The first wave didn’t materialize, which is a great thing,” Keeler, who was in contact with staff in Sand Point, told the Anchorage Daily News. No reports of major structural damage were made on the island, Keeler told the newspaper.
   
      “We’ve canceled the (tsunami) advisories because it doesn’t look like it’s becoming a large wave or any larger,” National Tsunami Warning Center Director James Gridley said, according to CNN affiliate KTUU.
   
      Strong shaking was reported on the peninsula, the USGS said. Light to weak shaking was reported around Kodiak, about 300 miles northeast of the quake’s center, and in Anchorage, some 530 miles from the center, according to the USGS.
   
      In Kodiak, a city of about 6,000 people, a long line of cars headed up a mountain after residents learned of the tsunami warning late Tuesday, John Cannon told KTUU.
   
      Police were “trying to clear the lower areas down by the harbor,” he said.
   
      “You (could) hear the tsunami alarms. It’s rather eerie,” he told KTUU.
   
      This quake’s depth was 28 kilometers, or 17 miles, the USGS said – relatively shallow.
   
      “Anything below 70 kilometers is considered a shallow quake,” CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. “That’s important, because shallow earthquakes often cause the most damage, compared to the ones that are deeper, regardless of the strength.”
   
      More than 20 aftershocks followed the quake late Tuesday to early Wednesday, ranging from magnitudes of 2.8 to 6.1.

Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed and another injured in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise, he said reports were of minor damage such as broken windows and collapsed walls. Ports, airports, and refineries weren’t damaged, he said in a video-recorded phone conversation with his civil defense chief. There had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out in some areas. Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.  It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico. In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small, protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued. “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitudes 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves 3 to 10 feet above tide levels along with parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru, and Ecuador. Guatemala’s national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea.

The USGS estimates the earthquake itself could result in as many as 100 fatalities and $100 million in damage.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a tsunami warning for the coast of Mexico, with waves of up to 3 meters. The warning also reaches Ecuador, where there could be waves of between 0.3 and 1 meter in height.

[+] Geological Survey of Israel, diagram shared by @NadavWetzler. A massive explosion in the city of Beirut, Lebanon, killed more than 100 people and flattened nearby buildings, sending shock waves more than 250 kilometers (150 miles) across the ground. Eyewitness accounts describe widespread shacking of buildings in a radius of 50 kilometers, and trembling of the ground felt still 250 kilometers away from the explosion center. The seismic waves were recorded by the seismographic network of the Geological Survey of Israel and seismic stations along the Syrian border to Turkey, almost 400 kilometers away. According to first estimates by geologists, the blast was equivalent to a magnitude 4.5 earthquake, comparable to the energy released by the detonation of 1.000 to 3.000 tons of TNT. The USGS gives a lower magnitude of 3.3. The reported magnitude is not directly comparable to an earthquake of similar size because the explosion occurred at the surface where seismic waves are not as efficiently generated. News reports state the explosion was caused by the deflagration of 2.750 tons of ammonium nitrate stocked in the port district of Beirut, which is roughly equivalent to 1.100 tons of TNT. A diagram shared by Jugurtha Kariche, a geologist at the Institute de Physique du Globe in Strasbourg, France, shows the typical seismogram caused by an explosion.

A first body wave magnitude estimation give also a magnitude Mb~4. For comparison this is equivalent in term of energy to 1000 t of TNT. An earthquake is caused by the sliding of rocks along a fracture, resulting in seismic waves with a complex seismogram. The seismic sensor will first detect the Primary (P- or compressional waves) and then Secondary (S- or Transverse) Waves, followed by the more destructive surface or Rayleigh Waves. An explosion generates a sphere of fast-traveling compressional waves, spreading in all directions at the same speed, resulting in a more simple pattern. During a blast, a sudden peak of P-Waves is followed by a tail of weaker interference and surface waves, without a recognizable S-Waves peak.

Please enter a search term.       ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A powerful earthquake located off Alaska’s southern coast jolted some coastal communities late Tuesday, and some residents briefly scrambled for higher ground over fears of a tsunami. There were no immediate reports of damage in the sparsely populated area of the state, and tsunami warning was canceled after the magnitude 7.8 quake off the Alaska Peninsula produced a wave of a less than a foot.  Because of its location, nearby communities along the Alaska Peninsula did not experience shaking that would normally be associated with that magnitude of a quake, said Michael West, Alaska State Seismologist.  “No reports of any damage,” Kodiak Police Sgt. Mike Sorter told The Associated Press early Wednesday morning. “No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal.” Kodiak is about 200 miles northeast of where the earthquake was centered. The tsunami warning had coastal residents evacuating for higher ground. Social media posts showed long lines of people fleeing towns like Homer and Kodiak while tsunami sirens wailed in the background. On Kodiak Island, the local high school opened its doors for evacuees, as did the local Catholic school, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “We’ve got a high school full of people,” said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. “I’ve been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,” he told the Daily News. “Everything’s as calm as can be. We’ve got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,” he said before the warning was canceled. Tsunami warnings are commonplace for people who grew up in Kodiak. ”I’ve been doing these since I was a little kid,” LeDoux told the newspaper. “Old news.” Officials at the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, began calling off tsunami advisories and warnings after a wave of only 25 centimeters (.8 foot) was recorded in the community of Sand Point. “I might have expected a little bit more water, but I’m happy that there wasn’t,” said David Hale, the senior duty scientist at the tsunami center. Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that caused damage in the Anchorage area in November 2018. “This earthquake released about 15 times as much energy as that earthquake, said West, the state seismologist. More than a dozen aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or higher were reported immediately after the earthquake, he said by telephone from the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ”We got people here who are going be working all night,” West said early Wednesday morning. ”These aftershocks will go and go and go and go.” The Alaska-Aleutian Trench was also where a magnitude 9.2 quake in 1964 was centered. That remains the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded. The temblor and ensuing tsunami caused widespread damage and killed 131 people, some as far away as Oregon and California. Alaska is the most actively seismic state. Nearly 25,000 earthquakes have been recorded in Alaska since Jan. 1, according to the center. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — A powerful earthquake centered near the southern Mexico resort of Huatulco killed at least one person, swayed buildings in Mexico City and sent thousands fleeing into the streets. Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed and another injured in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise he said reports were of minor damage such as broken windows and collapsed walls. Ports, airports and refineries were not damaged, he said in a video-recorded phone conversation with his civil defense chief. There had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out to some areas.  Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.  It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico. In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued. “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves three to 10 feet above tide levels along parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru and Ecuador. Guatemala’s national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea.

From an earthquake to a school shooting, and finishing senior year during a pandemic, Northeast High School student Kenny Kernizan has walked a unique journey. Tuesday was the day high school seniors across Philadelphia got to celebrate together. For Kernizan, overcoming a tremendous amount of adversity pushed him to the finish line. He stood proud in his black cap and gown Tuesday and he and his family, including those watching from Haiti, celebrated. ""It was very, very, very difficult,"" Kernizan said. Kernizan survived the 2010 earthquake in Haiti that left his mother injured and their family homeless for weeks. ""She was sitting in the streets crying and I was crying too. I was depressed,"" he said. Looking for a new life in the United States, Kernizan had no idea he would face the deadly shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where his football coach died protecting students. ""He died for us and he's a hero,"" Kernizan said. Even then, his family's faith never wavered. He may not be walking across a stage, but after overcoming such adversity, the district is also proud. ""Your class has handled the uncertainty and unrest with such poise, grace, and resiliency. The potential in this class is simply extraordinary,"" School District of Philadelphia Superintendent Dr. William Hite said. The celebration lasted all day Tuesday, with a special message from a former Philly graduate. ""I know that this is not how you planned your graduation. You planned to walk those same steps that everybody else did but honey, you can wear somebody else's shoes but you cannot walk in their feet. This is your path. Congratulations, you're doing it,"" singer and actress Jill Scott said. It's been a long road but all 13,000 graduates finally made it.

      A 5.1-magnitude earthquake hit about 2 miles from the town of Sparta, North Carolina, early Sunday, along the state’s border with Virginia, according to the preliminary report from the US Geological Survey. 
   
      It’s the strongest quake to shake the state since 1926, according to the North Carolina Geological Survey.
   
      The quake, whose epicenter is in Alleghany County, was felt as far away as Washington D.C. and Atlanta, according to reports to the USGS. 
   
      It struck about 8:07 a.m. ET. 
   
      Alleghany County Sheriff Bryan Maines was getting ready for church when “stuff started falling off of the wall,” he said. The house appeared to shift, and it felt like it might fall down, he told CNN. 
   
      “Started getting some sheet rock damage. My chimney was starting to crack,” he said. “Several houses with structure damage. We have folks out right now. There are houses that have shifted 1 or 2 inches off their foundation. There are folks who have had to leave their homes because it’s not safe inside. It’s a pretty big event.” 
   
      There were no immediate reports of injuries, but there is damage in the town of about 1,800 people, Sparta Mayor Wes Brinegar said, adding that the foundation of his home cracked and items fell from shelves inside his home. 
   
      “It felt like a big locomotive going by and a big wave coming underneath the bed,” the mayor said. “I’ve lived here my whole life and have never felt anything like that.”
   
      The USGS says earthquakes become destructive at a magnitude of 4.0 to 5.0, depending on variables. A 5.3-magnitude is considered a moderate quake, the USGS says. 
   
      The agency issued a green alert, meaning there is a low likelihood of casualties and damage. 
   
      Town Councilman Cole Edwards, too, was jolted awake by the quake, he said. There was no damage to his home, but it broke some dishes and knocked some pictures off of the wall, he said. 
   
      “We’ve had a lot of scared folks this morning,” the mayor said. “That was the most intense one we’ve ever had.”
   
      The earthquake rumbled at a depth of about 5.7 miles, which is considered a shallow quake. Quakes shallower than 43 miles tend to be more destructive than deeper ones, the USGS says.
   
      This marks North Carolina’s strongest earthquake since a 5.2-magnitude struck Mitchell County, about 50 miles northeast of Asheville, on July 8, 1926, the North Carolina Geological Survey says. A 5.5-magnitude shook Skyland in 1916, the agency said. 
   
      Sparta is about 100 miles north of Charlotte. A Charlotte firefighters union tweeted there were no reports of injuries. 
   
      “Good Morning Charlotte, we are sure most of you are awake because yes, that was an earthquake you felt. No local reports of damage or injuries but what a wake up call,” the union tweeted.
   
      Sheriff Maines’ deputies are making sure they’re “highly visible right now,” he said. 
   
      “With the pandemic going on, people have higher anxiety right now. One of the biggest things for law enforcement right now is to calm the waters, for people to live in peace and not be in fear right now,” he said. “We live in a small mountain community. We all plan on taking care of each other.”
   
      The Sparta area sits among three seismic zones, in Charleston, South Carolina, eastern Tennessee and central Virginia. Several smaller quakes, all 2.6-magnitude or lower, rumbled near Sparta on Saturday and early Sunday. Two more temblors struck a few miles from Seymour, Tennessee, last weekend, the USGS says.  
   
A USGS impact map shows the agency received reports from people who felt the quake all along the eastern seaboard. The map shows clusters of reports more than 300 miles away, in Atlanta and in the nation’s capital. 
   
      “I felt my bed shaking ever so slightly, and I knew it was the unmistakable feel of an earthquake, but it was so subtle, I didn’t know if others might notice and I figured the origin had to be far away,” Limaya Atembina of Rockville, Maryland, told CNN in a Facebook message.

The most powerful earthquake to hit North Carolina in more than 100 years shook much of the state early Sunday, rattling homes, businesses and residents.  There were no reports of serious injuries, but some minor structural damage was reported in Sparta, as well as cracks in roads. Images on social media also showed items knocked off of grocery store shelves. The U.S. Geological Survey said on its website that there are chances for more aftershocks in the next week, forecasting a 45% chance for earthquakes of magnitude 3 or greater. The chances of another quake as strong as the one on Sunday or greater was about 1%, the geological survey said. Allegheny County, which includes Sparta, declared a state of emergency Sunday afternoon. Michael Hull was standing in his driveway at his home in Sparta when he noticed a group of deer running. “Not even a minute passed and the side-to-side motion started,” Hull said. “It takes you a minute to realize what’s happening, and you just can’t believe it. Then it was over. It was loud, like God was shaking a mountain at you, literally.” Karen Backer was in her Greensboro apartment when she heard initially mistook banging in her kitchen for her roommate. “Nope, it was the cabinet doors ‘clinking’ open and closed! My neighbors on the other hand said they felt our apartment building shaking,” Backer said. “Well, sadly, nothing surprises me in 2020, but a hurricane and an earthquake in the same week is crazy.” It was the largest earthquake to hit the state since 1916, when a magnitude 5.5 quake occurred near Skyland, the weather service said. The quake’s epicenter was about 2.5 miles (four kilometers) southeast of Sparta, just south of the Virginia-North Carolina border, the geological survey said. The USGS said the population in the affected region resides in structures “that are resistant to earthquake shaking, though vulnerable structures exist.” The quake was felt in nearby states including Virginia, South Carolina and Tennessee.

         LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — A coalition of Hollywood stakeholders are speaking out against a plan to develop two skyscrapers after recent geological studies showed earthquake-causing fault lines running through the proposed site. A letter from the California Geological Survey last week to LA's planning department said scientists found multiple fault lines capable of causing an earthquake where the development – named the Hollywood Center – is planned. ""These studies strongly support the presence of an active southern fault strand entering the eastern Hollywood Center property in the vicinity of the alley at Argyle,'' the letter said. The letter also said the U.S. Geological Survey's own peer-reviewed analysis of the Hollywood Fault zone in the immediate area of the proposed development showed near-surface fault traces of the Hollywood Fault in the same locations. The USGS study showed four fault projections that run through the area, with some going directly through the planned sites. Attorneys for the Stop the Millennium Hollywood Coalition said they believe the most recent environmental reports that developer Millennium Partners submitted to Los Angeles planning staff left out critical data related to possible earthquakes. ""We have much more evidence, in fact bombshell evidence, that the project site ... is riddled with earthquake faults,'' said Robert Silverstein, the attorney for the Stop the Millennium Hollywood. ""If Los Angeles City Hall has any integrity, it will listen to the preeminent United States Geological Survey and California Geological Survey and not approve Millennium's dangerous new proposal.''  The plans for the development include a 46-story building to the west of the iconic Capitol Records building and a 35-story structure to the east. It also includes two other, 11-story buildings. Altogether, the development would include 1,005 residential units and up to 30,176 square feet of commercial use space within the four mixed-use buildings, according to the LA planning department.

The shaking was felt all the way in Southern California. FRESNO, Calif. -- A preliminary magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the eastern part of Central California Wednesday morning, according to the USGS. The temblor was reported in the Owens Valley, south of the town of Lone Pine on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  Residents across Central California reported feeling the quake, as did people in some parts of Northern and Southern California. Waves were felt in the Los Angeles basin, 200 miles away from the epicenter. Clovis resident, Ashley Rios, shared a photo with us of a crack in the tile of her home caused by the earthquake. Footage from a grocery store in Lone Pine showed a mess - cans were strewn on the floor and broken glass was everywhere. Lone Pine sits in a gigantic trough between two ranges of the Sierra Nevadas. It is here in the Owens Valley that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power aqueduct is situated to supply mountain water to Los Angeles. LADWP said engineers are examining the dams and waterways following the quake. So far, there have been no reports of damage. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said that the Owens Valley quake is in the same location that a M 4.6 quake was felt two nights ago. That smaller, earlier quake is now considered a foreshock to Wednesday's quake.  Wednesday's quake sent hearts racing in Ridgecrest, where a flurry of shocks, as strong as 7.1, hit last year around the Fourth of July. ""This is a different fault than the Ridgecrest earthquake, and it's far enough away that it doesn't fall within the traditional definition of aftershocks. Rather, we would look at it as its own earthquake,"" Jones said. In the minutes after the magnitude 5.8 earthquake, there were more than a half a dozen aftershocks, ranging from M 2.5 up to M 4.6. As for the statistical chance of a greater earthquake in the area, Jones said with every quake, there is a 5% chance of something bigger.

What does it mean?,2020-08-11 11:24 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/11/huge-crack-appears-hill-after-earthquake-north-carolina-what-does-it-mean/,"(The Charlotte Observer) - That “crack” spotted in a hillside after Sparta, North Carolina, suffered a 5.1 earthquake Sunday may be a lot less ominous than some people feared. It shocked tourists in town for the weekend, but some locals say it predates the quake. Vacationer Travis Simpson-Hunt describes a scene out of a disaster movie when he recalls birds taking flight seconds before the earthquake and the sound of a train roaring through his cabin. But the damage he saw was just as disturbing. This includes a “crack” in a hillside that prompted drivers to pull over and take photos. “There was this big one (crack) and a small one below it. And then lots of cracks the width of my foot going across the road,” Simpson-Hunt said. “It was not far outside of town.” The family packed up after only one day in town and headed back to Pennsylvania, he said. The exact location of the gash in the hill has not been revealed, but at least one landowner says its not new. Its age isn’t known, but some in Sparta say it’s not a crack, but a rut where cows have tread on a family’s farm outside of town. The gash is definitely not an actual fault line crack, the U.S. Geological Survey says. “Faults do not open up during an earthquake,” it reports. Gaping cracks forming in quakes and swallowing things up are among the biggest myths associated with earthquakes, according to a report by the University of San Diego. “Certainly, earthquakes can cause cracks to form in the Earth,” the university reported. “However, these cracks are generally quite small and only rarely do they exceed a meter or two in width. And certainly these cracks don’t again close up and swallow somebody whole.” The U.S. Geological Survey says the 5.1 earthquake originated at a depth of 2.3 miles, and was the strongest of at least seven quakes that rattled the area over 24 hours. Experts say damage was more wide spread in the community than expected, because it was a relatively “shallow” earthquake.

We all served, we all fought for the community and now we are able to come home and give something back to the community,” said Blevins.  And that damage was also seen firsthand by the Commissioner of Insurance and other emergency management officials who toured the VFW.

According to the experts, the substance they detected is known as methylmercury, which is the toxic form of mercury and could easily accumulate in certain animals, including the crustaceans and fishes living in the trench that reaches a depth of up to 36,000 feet. Although the experts say that mercury could be released by natural phenomena like volcanic eruptions, most of the mercury they detected in the trench resulted from human activities like metal mining and production.  In a research led by Joel Blum from the University of Michigan, the team acquired samples from the fishes and crustaceans in Mariana Trench from the depths of around 23,000 to 33,000 feet, located near the Philippines and the Kermadec trench in New Zealand. They detected mercury in the samples they gathered with the chemical signature of the substance, indicating that it came from the atmosphere and ended up in the water through the rain. Blum did say that some of the mercury they have found in the samples might have occurred naturally, but the researchers believe most of it most likely came from human activity. Additionally, the researcher said the mercury emission from humans had exceeded natural emission by three-fold. ""The key finding is that mercury released by humans and deposited from the atmosphere to the surface of the oceans is being transported to the most remote and deepest environments in the ocean,"" Blum said. According to Science Alert, experts in the field were able to unearth the mystery's answer by creating a 3D model of the fault zone with the help of a machine-learning algorithm. Based on their study, they found that some fluid might be the culprit, probably carbon dioxide in liquid form or water, which possibly breached a barrier of the underground rock and changed the balance of pressure and the friction along the fault line. This could have led to a series of minor tremors in the area. Unlike a significant earthquake wherein one major event is followed by minor tremors, an earthquake swarm does not have any significant event. The Cahuilla swarm, as it is known, occurred near Mt. San Jacinto in southern California.   Sign up for our free newsletter for the Latest coverage!

         LOS ANGELES (CBSLA/AP) — Android users in California will no longer need to download an app to get alerts about earthquakes. California's earthquake early warnings will be a standard feature on all Android phones, bypassing the need for users to download the state's MyShake app in order to receive alerts, the California Office of Emergency Services said. The state worked with the U.S. Geological Survey and Google, the maker of Android, to build the quake alerts into all phones that run the commonplace operating system. The deal was expected to be announced Tuesday. ""This announcement means that California's world-class earthquake early warning system will be a standard function on every Android phone — giving millions precious seconds to drop, cover and hold on when the big one hits,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. The technology does not predict earthquakes. It is designed to quickly take data from seismic sensors and send warnings to potentially affected areas if a quake of magnitude 4.5 or greater occurs and if the projected shaking at a particular location is at a certain level of intensity. The technology was initially designed to only send out alerts at a magnitude 5 or greater, but that threshold was lowered to 4.5 after the two massive Ridgecrest earthquakes in July of 2019 for which L.A. County residents did not receive any alerts.  In the early morning hours of July 30, a 4.2-magnitude earthquake struck the Pacoima area of the San Fernando Valley. It was felt across the Southland and was followed up by more than 60 aftershocks. Some with ShakeAlertLA, Los Angeles County's version of the MyShake app, reported receiving a notification, while others did not. The MyShake technology -- developed by the USGS and the University of California, Berkeley -- was released in early 2019. Warnings produced by the ShakeAlert system are also pushed through the wireless notification system that issues Amber Alerts, meaning some people receive both notifications.

California (NBC) (08/13/20)— Android phones will be used to sense earthquakes around the world and may one day be able to provide global warnings, with the first mass alert system unveiled Tuesday in California, Google announced.  Google, which helped develop Android, worked with California and the U.S. Geological Survey to build the quake alerts into all phones that run the commonplace mobile operating system.  Android users who have enabled location services and are near a quake of magnitude 4.5 or greater will receive a full-screen earthquake warning telling them to drop to the floor and seek cover. The screen also will provide estimates of the quake’s magnitude and distance from the user. The alert is based on the projected shaking at a particular location and a certain level of intensity.  Depending on their distance from a quake, people could get several seconds or perhaps a full minute of warning. The warnings are powered by California’s ShakeAlert system, which uses signals from more than 700 seismometers installed around the state that can sense seismic waves. However, users won’t need to download the state’s MyShake app in order to receive the alerts.  That application, developed by the University of California, Berkeley and launched last year, has been downloaded by only about 1 million of California’s 40 million residents. By contrast, many millions of people own Android phones. “This announcement means that California’s world-class earthquake early warning system will be a standard function on every Android phone — giving millions precious seconds to drop, cover, and hold on when the big one hits,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. IPhone users won’t receive the alerts through Apple’s operating system, but they can download the MyShake app. Also Tuesday, Google announced that Android phones will begin detecting earthquakes from around the world through their motion-sensing accelerometers. “Your Android phone can be a mini-seismometer, joining millions of other Android phones out there to form the world’s largest earthquake detection network,” according to a Google blog post. More than 2 billion devices run the Android operating system. Hundreds of millions of people live in earthquake-prone areas, but many countries lack the resources to build detection and alert systems, Google said. The information will be used at first to provide fast and accurate information on Google Search, but Google said it could begin sending out earthquake alerts next year.

1775,"California's Earthquake Swarm was Triggered by Fluid Spillage, AI Algorithm Says",2020-06-23 06:04 UTC,https://www.techtimes.com/articles/250542/20200623/californias-earthquake-swarm-was-triggered-by-fluid-spillage-ai-algorithm-says.htm," Using 3D modeling and machine learning, scientists claim they have solved the mystery of the tiny earthquakes that rumbled daily under Cahuilla, California, from early 2016 to late 2019 - nearly four years. Some kind of natural fluid, such as water or liquid carbon dioxide, is likely to be the culprit. As a new study points out, it undoubtedly breached a barrier in the underground rock, altering the pressure and friction equilibrium along the fault line, and contributing to a long sequence of minor tremors. The study can be seen in the Science journal.  The techniques deployed here could prove vital in understanding and predicting future earthquakes. Like the one that happened near Cahuilla, both major quakes and smaller swarms add up to tens of thousands of individual occurrences. Around 22,000 mysterious earthquakes rumbled Southern California since 2016. The behavior has confounded scientists for years.  ""What we're learning is that you really need to understand the fault in three dimensions to get a clear picture of why earthquake swarms occur."" Ross and his colleagues used neural networks to examine thousands of seismic events, ranging from 0.7 to 4.4 in magnitude. The analysis revealed a deep, narrow 3D fault line extending down approximately 8 kilometers (5 miles). The model showed an underground reservoir's likely presence. It was initially cut off from the fault zone before it leaked through and triggered the tremors. Spotting this was only made possible by high-resolution simulation of the team. If the work is completed, it sheds light when viewed in profile on a narrow, 50-meter long fault zone with steep curves. It was those curves, Ross says, that revealed the explanation for seismic activity in the area for many years. The study says the leading potential explanation for the swarms was groundwater circulation or a slow slippage on an active fault, called fault creep. ""The detail here is incredible,"" seismologist Elizabeth Vanacore from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez, who wasn't involved in the research, told Maya Wei-Haas at National Geographic. ""This type of work is cutting edge and really where the science is going."" Swarms like the one studied here typically don't contain any major quakes. They are also much less predictable than the big earthquakes, which usually begin with a major shock followed by slowly declining aftershocks. What made this particular swarm fascinating is it lasted too long -- more like a swarm in slow motion. Other swarms are likely to last days, weeks, or months. The scientists say it is now winding down, probably because the fluid has reached an impermeable barrier. The next step is to test the simulation technique further afield, across southern California and elsewhere - it could be that further earthquake swarms are responsible for natural fluid injections, which seismologists would study using this methodology. ""These observations bring us closer to providing concrete explanations for how and why earthquake swarms start, grow, and terminate,"" says Ross.

The study says the leading potential explanation for the swarms was groundwater circulation or a slow slippage on an active fault, called fault creep.
""This type of work is cutting edge and really where the science is going."" Swarms like the one studied here typically don't contain any major quakes.
The next step is to test the simulation technique further afield, across southern California and elsewhere - it could be that further earthquake swarms are responsible for natural fluid injections, which seismologists would study using this methodology.
""These observations bring us closer to providing concrete explanations for how and why earthquake swarms start, grow, and terminate,"" says Ross.",California,38.2969,-76.4949

         A powerful 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck the Aleutian Islands area off the Alaskan peninsula late Tuesday, prompting a tsunami warning for cities and towns within 200 miles of the epicenter. Police in Kodiak urged residents to rush to higher ground ahead of the tsunami's possible arrival. Aftershocks were being felt. The tusnami warning was canceled within about four hours. But a tsunami that measured 0.8 feet in the city of Sand Point was generated, reports CBS Anchorage affiliate KTVA-TV. Jeremy Zidek, with the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, told the station Sand Point sounded sirens twice and evacuated, but it wasn't clear what, if any, damage occurred.

         ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP/CBS SF) -- A powerful 7.8 earthquake struck the Alaska Peninsula late Tuesday, triggering a tsunami warning that sent residents fleeing to higher ground before it was called off without any damaging waves. Hundreds wore masks against the spread of the coronavirus as they gathered in shelters.   ""No reports of any damage,"" Kodiak Police Sgt. Mike Sorter told The Associated Press early Wednesday morning. ""No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal."" The quake triggered tsunami warning for a South Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands that was called off early Wednesday about two hours after the quake. Tsunami warning sirens could be heard blaring in videos posted on social media as residents heeded warnings to evacuate. On Kodiak Island, the local high school opened its doors for evacuees, as did the local Catholic school, the Anchorage Daily New s reported. ""We've got a high school full of people,"" said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. ""I've been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,"" he told the Daily News. ""Everything's as calm as can be. We've got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,"" he said. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later called off the tsunami threat for other U.S. and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America as well. ""There was actually even no reported wave activity for our area,"" Sorter said of the tsunami that was eventually canceled. According to the USGS, since 1900 there have been six other earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 and higher within 155 miles (250 km) of Tuesday's quake. The largest of those was a 8.2 quake in 1938.

There were no immediate reports of damage in the sparsely populated area of the state, and tsunami warning was canceled after the magnitude 7.8 quake off the Alaska Peninsula produced a wave of a less than a foot.

Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that caused damage in the Anchorage area in November 2018. “This earthquake released about 15 times as much energy as that earthquake, said West, the state seismologist. More than a dozen aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or higher were reported immediately after the earthquake, he said by telephone from the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “We got people here who are going be working all night,” West said early Wednesday morning. “These aftershocks will go and go and go and go.” The Alaska-Aleutian Trench was also where a magnitude 9.2 quake in 1964 was centered. That remains the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded. The temblor and ensuing tsunami caused widespread damage and killed 131 people, some as far away as Oregon and California.

1948,"Weird, Z-shaped faults could trigger a large earthquake on California's San Andreas Fault",2020-07-17 15:11 UTC,https://www.livescience.com/weird-faults-trigger-san-andreas-earthquake.html,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Two big earthquakes at Ridgecrest last year have increased the chances of a San Andreas Fault quake. It's impossible to know when the San Andreas Fault will erupt with its next big earthquake — a temblor that could impact the nearly 13 million people who live in the Los Angeles metro area — but it appears that two other nearby faults might have some say in that matter. The San Andreas Fault is part of a giant ""Z"" of faults; the top of the ""Z"" consists of the Ridgecrest Fault, the middle is the Garlock Fault and the bottom is the southern part of the famous San Andreas. If the ""top-of-the-Z"" Ridgecrest Fault were to have a really big earthquake (at least a magnitude 7.5), that could trigger an earthquake on the ""middle-of-the-Z"" Garlock Fault, which, in turn, could cause a massive earthquake along the ""bottom-of-the-Z"" San Andreas, a new study finds.  These successive earthquakes wouldn't necessarily happen all at once, but over a period of time (perhaps even decades) as stress builds up and gets transferred from one fault to the next, said study co-author Ross Stein, a geophysicist and the founder and CEO of Temblor, Inc., a company that models and assesses earthquake risks.  ""What we are describing isn't likely and it's a kind of an earthquake chain reaction,"" Stein told Live Science. ""But what we've learned over the last four months is chain reactions really do happen in nature. And if we are unprepared, as we were in COVID, they have enormous consequences."" There are so many faults (and earthquakes) in California because that's where the Pacific Plate grinds against the North American tectonic plate. However, the San Andreas Fault, which snakes roughly 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) from the Salton Sea to the Mendocino Coast, is notorious because it caused the deadliest earthquake in the nation's history; the 1906 magnitude-7.8 San Francisco earthquake killed an estimated 3,000 people.  The new analysis of this possible ""earthquake chain reaction"" suggests that another large San Andreas rumbler near Los Angeles is now 3.5 to 5 times more likely than scientists previously thought, thanks to the Ridgecrest quakes.  The Garlock Fault is relatively quiet; it hasn't released a significant earthquake in about 500 years. But if the Garlock Fault ruptures within about 30 miles (45 km) of its junction with the San Andreas Fault, it could raise the likelihood of a San Andreas quake to the southeast — the so-called Mojave section — by a factor of about 150, Stein and study co-author Shinji Toda, a professor of natural disaster research who specializes in seismology at Tohoku University in Japan, wrote on the Temblor blog.  ""We thus estimate the net chance of a large San Andreas earthquake in the next 12 months to be 1.15%, or 1 chance in 87,"" they wrote in the post.  Such an earthquake could be catastrophic. Were a magnitude-7.8 earthquake to hit the southern San Andreas Fault, it could cause more than 1,800 deaths, 50,000 injuries and $200 billion in damage and other losses, according to a 2008 report from the U.S. Geological Survey.    ""Ridgecrest was a humbling experience,"" Stein told Live Science. ""I think anybody would have told you that given how well mapped California is, that any fault that can [release] a 7.1 would have been known. And it was unknown."" The 2019 earthquakes along Ridgecrest added stress along the Garlock Fault, according to information gleaned from satellite data, Stein said.    However, the area's big earthquakes don't happen like clockwork, so it's challenging to know when the next powerful one might hit, Stein noted. So, to forecast when the next massive earthquake might strike, Stein and Toda developed a new forecasting method. (To be clear, a forecast is not the same as a prediction, because it's impossible to predict earthquakes. Instead, forecasts look at probability, or the chance that an earthquake of a certain magnitude might happen in a given place and time period.) This machine-learning model looked at how stress was transferred by earthquakes and used past earthquakes to test its accuracy. In fact, the model shows that the June 2020 Ridgecrest earthquakes fit into the forecast for the region. The model showed — in part because of the added stress from the recent Ridgecrest earthquakes — that the Garlock Fault has a 2.3% chance of producing a magnitude-7.7 earthquake in the next year, or a 1 in 43 probability. This chance is 100 times higher than the 0.023% chance given by the Third California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF3), a forecast that is put out by the Southern California Earthquake Center and the California Geological Survey and released in 2017. And, this possible magnitude-7.7 (or even a magnitude-7.5) earthquake along the Garlock Fault, the model shows, could trigger a large earthquake along the Mojave section of the San Andreas Fault, Stein said.    Even so, it's good that the public and public-policy experts be aware of this chance, however small, Stein said. It could also serve as a gentle reminder that people living near the San Andreas Fault should retrofit their houses to make them earthquake-ready, assemble earthquake-preparedness kits and buy earthquake insurance, Stein said.  ""If you're a homeowner and you've been on the fence about earthquake insurance [because] it's too expensive,"" keep in mind that your risk just went up by a factor of 3.5 to 5, Stein said. It doesn't appear that insurance companies are raising rates because of this study, ""so you're basically getting insurance at a colossal discount,"" he said.   —New photos of Pakistan's earthquake island released  Other geophysicists have pointed out that the new study's model doesn't account for the Earth's intricacies. For instance, the model doesn't incorporate the complexities of fluid interactions, which can change stresses on faults over time, nor does it factor in the different types of rock in that region, Pablo Gonzalez, a geophysicist with the University of Liverpool in England, who was not part of the study, told National Geographic (opens in new tab). Stein said that since the study came out in the journal Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America on July 14, he's talked with a number of colleagues who have pointed out issues with the model. Many of these issues are addressed in the study's supplementary data, he said, but even so, models can never completely mimic real-world situations. ""I feel that what we are saying is speculative and it's uncertain, and we acknowledge that and we understand that,"" Stein said. ""But the flip side of that coin is [that] the consequences of this are so important that we should try to estimate it, and this should start a discussion of what we should be putting in our models of earthquake occurrence.""

It's impossible to know when the San Andreas Fault will erupt with its next big earthquake — a temblor that could impact the nearly 13 million people who live in the Los Angeles metro area — but it appears that two other nearby faults might have some say in that matter.
If the ""top-of-the-Z"" Ridgecrest Fault were to have a really big earthquake (at least a magnitude 7.5), that could trigger an earthquake on the ""middle-of-the-Z"" Garlock Fault, which, in turn, could cause a massive earthquake along the ""bottom-of-the-Z"" San Andreas, a new study finds.
These successive earthquakes wouldn't necessarily happen all at once, but over a period of time (perhaps even decades) as stress builds up and gets transferred from one fault to the next, said study co-author Ross Stein, a geophysicist and the founder and CEO of Temblor, Inc., a company that models and assesses earthquake risks.

1965,"'Did I just feel an earthquake?': Many surprised, others unbothered by NC's 5.1 magnitude earthquake",2020-08-10 03:01 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/09/did-i-just-feel-an-earthquake-many-surprised-others-unbothered-by-ncs-magnitude-earthquake/,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Sunday morning’s earthquake did not cause any damage in Charlotte and nearby areas. But, that doesn’t mean people aren’t talking about it, because so many felt the 5.1 magnitude earthquake. Earthquakes are not all that common in North Carolina. Sunday was the first time many people experienced what it was like to sit through the shaking and rattling of this type of magnitude. This was the biggest earthquake to hit North Carolina since 1916, according to the USGS. The shaking ground did not stop service at St. Mark’s Episcopal in Gastonia. Video from a recorded livestream shows the priest continuing on with his sermon without the slightest of a pause. “My first thought was, ‘Was that an earthquake? Did I just feel an earthquake?’ said Dionne Browning, a member of St. Mark’s Episcopal. Browning was behind the camera filming at the time. She said she was blown away by the priest’s composure through the unexpected Earth movements. Realizing that no one would be hurt, the priest even made a joke once the shaking stopped. “He said not to worry and that it was just God saying, ‘Amen to his sermon,’ said Browning. Around Charlotte, some others were rattled by the historic 5.1 magnitude earthquake. “My house started shaking ... it was pretty scary,” said Cindy Houseworth of Charlotte. Derrick Funberburk, another who felt the ground shake said, “For me, it was just an uncomfortable 8 seconds wondering what exactly is going on and was worried about my kids. That was it.”  Anytime there’s an earthquake, aftershocks follow. When that happens, the movement of the Earth happens in shorter, weaker spurts. According to Dr. Andy Bobyarchick, an Earth Science professor at UNC Charlotte, aftershocks could very well be in our future, but he says there’s nothing to be worried about. “The aftershocks for this earthquake are probably not going to be large enough to cause damage or possibly be felt,” said Dr. Bobyarchick. Not everyone was so shocked about this earthquake. There are some people who did not feel anything at all when it happened. Copyright 2020 WBTV.

(Candace Nielsen photo)  A powerful earthquake that prompted tsunami warnings and evacuations Tuesday night caused serious shaking in some Alaska Peninsula communities but little damage. Now, the state seismologist says the quake itself might offer some insight into a scientific debate on earthquakes in the region. Shortly after 10 p.m. Tuesday, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake centered about 65 miles south of Perryville on the Alaska Peninsula prompted a series of tsunami warnings that stretched from the Aleutian Islands all the way to the western Kenai Peninsula. Sirens sounded in multiple communities into the night. The warnings sent Alaskans scrambling to higher ground in communities as widespread as Kodiak, Sand Point, Unalaska and Homer. Jennifer Kalmakoff, 44, was on a four-wheeler ride with her daughter just outside Perryville when she watched a rockslide on an island across the water Tuesday night. Then the back wheels of the four-wheeler started swerving. Maybe it was because they were going fast on the sand dunes, she thought, but by the time they got back to the village, she saw people heading to higher ground. When she sat down at home, Kalmakoff saw everything shifting. She stood up and left quickly. “We didn’t have time to grab anything,” she said. “We just ran straight out the door and headed for the hills.” National Tsunami Warning Center officials canceled the tsunami warnings less than two hours after they were issued once there was no longer a threat. Kalmakoff and others in coastal communities across the region began to return home. The earthquake did produce a wave, albeit a roughly 10-inch one recorded in Sand Point.  Though some people in Anchorage received tsunami warning alerts, the Anchorage area was not at risk, said Louise Fode, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service. [Tsunami alerts were mistakenly sent to Anchorage after 7.8 earthquake off Alaska Peninsula, officials say] Watch the waves from the M7.8 Alaska earthquake roll across seismic stations in North America!

This animation, called a Ground Motion Visualization (GMV), shows the motion of the ground as detected on seismometers across North America - each dot is a seismic station and when the ground moves up it turns red and when it moves down it turns blue.

Waves generated by an earthquake travel around and through the earth, but they get smaller (attenuate) as they move away from the earthquake location, just like ripples in a pond. Once the earthquake waves are far enough away from the location where the earthquake occurred they can no longer be felt by people, BUT they can still be detected by sensitive seismic instruments. That's what this animation is showing - the waves from the M7.8 earthquake traveling both through the earth and across earth's surface - in the continental US the earthquake the waves are much too small to feel but not too small to measure. The scale is along the bottom. It is in micrometers (microns). For reference, the diameter of a human hair is ~50-75 microns.

The star shows the location of the earthquake. The green triangle is the station recording the seismogram shown along the bottom. The red line between the 2 is the ""great circle path"".

*Some of the instruments look like they are experiencing shaking before the seismic waves arrive. This is due to the setting of the animation and the calibration of the seismic instrument.

**The video is not reflecting the actual speed of the waves; it has been sped up. The time is shown along the bottom

This particular GMV is a brand new beta product generated using the vertical component of our Ground Motion Visualization (GMV). To produce a better coverage, the video is based on all available stations from any FDSN data center, using the fedcatalog service (http://service.iris.edu/irisws/fedcatalog/1/). The video uses the available BHZ, LHZ, or HHZ channel to produce the video, therefore provides a better coverage.

To see more GMV's visits http://ds.iris.edu/spud/gmv/17971022 The Alaska Earthquake Center recorded “very strong shaking” in places such as Sand Point, Cold Bay and Perryville, where the center has seismic stations, said Michael West, state seismologist at the Alaska Earthquake Center. The quake released “something like 15 times more energy than was released in the (magnitude 7.1) 2018 Anchorage earthquake,” according to West. Anecdotally, he said they’d heard about things falling off the wall but that they weren’t aware of “significant damage.” The earthquake itself is generating scientific interest because some evidence shows it may have occurred in a region — known as the Shumagin Gap, near the Shumagin Islands — where large earthquakes haven’t been documented before. Two tectonic plates meet along the southern coast of Alaska and pressure builds as the Pacific plate goes below the North American plate, known as a subduction zone. Energy builds up and then gets released in the form of earthquakes. Basically everywhere else outside of the Shumagin Gap along that subduction zone has ruptured, West said. “There has been a vigorous debate about whether it is an area that is somehow immune from large earthquakes because the fault pressure is kind of constantly released instead of building up to a big earthquake ... or whether it’s just really overdue,” West said. Michael West is an Alaska state seismologist based based at the Alaska Earthquake Center in Fairbanks. (JR Ancheta / UAF)  The aftershocks of the Tuesday night quake are occurring west of its epicenter, a “fairly strong suggestion that this earthquake in fact ruptured into the Shumagin Gap,” West said. But of course, it’s incredibly early in the research, and there’s a lot of data he would like to see. It will take time to figure everything out, West said, including looking at satellite images, and other measurements that might take a while. Plus, scientists can’t go on a field trip to the site of the quake since it’s underwater and it didn’t rupture up to the surface. If earthquakes can, in fact, rupture in the Shumagin Islands area, West said, “it kind of opens the door on what types of earthquakes could occur in that region. And that in turn impacts what kind of tsunamis we might expect, what kind of tsunamis we should plan for.” West acknowledged the collective sense of relief that the event wasn’t deadly. He said he was scared when he first got the alert because he knows the impact an earthquake in such a location can have. “With us now being able to rest easy about the impact of this earthquake, yeah, there’s some pretty meaningful science behind it as well,” West said. Location of earthquake Tuesday off the Alaska Peninsula. IUSGS map)  James Gridley, director of the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, said early Wednesday that “our procedures put us into a warning even if we haven’t measured a tsunami wave — we imply that there is until we know better.”  People in the community reported the ground felt “like Jell-O” during the earthquake and that it was hard to stand, Kalmakoff said. In Perryville, she said, they’re more used to magnitude 5.0 earthquakes but not what happened Tuesday. “Everybody was shaken up,” she said. “It took us a good 45 minutes to calm down.” Kalmakoff, a former health aide, said she helped tend to a man who was injured after he slipped on broken glass as he was running out. Aside from that, she’s heard about pictures falling and pantry items toppling. Candace Nielsen, 28, who lives in Cold Bay on the tip of the Alaska Peninsula and sits on the city council, felt the shaking in bed Tuesday night. She’s used to earthquakes, but this one kept going. “It was like the whole house was on a extremely rough wave,” she said. Nielsen, her husband and her three kids — who are 5 months old, 2 years old and 7 years old — waited for the shaking to stop. Her 7-year-old daughter was “petrified,” she said. Then they got word of the tsunami warning. Nielsen went through a similar situation two years ago, but this was scarier because of how strong the earthquake was, she said. Nielsen got the kids dressed, grabbed blankets and diapers and left the house to meet her mom. They, along with their two dogs, all piled into Nielsen’s truck and headed to Cold Bay’s evacuation site. Her husband, a first responder, was helping coordinate evacuations in their other truck.  She just wanted to get home and put her kids in bed, Nielsen said. Cell service at the evacuation site is “patchy,” and Nielsen wanted to check in with the rest of her family. She thought that she’d have cracks in the foundation of her house, but they only had a plant fall. And in Cold Bay, there was a patch of road damaged. “I just wanted to get back and tell everybody that we were OK,” Nielsen said. “And just to know that our town was OK and wasn’t under a wave.” [Because of a high volume of comments requiring moderation, we are temporarily disabling comments on many of our articles so editors can focus on the coronavirus crisis and other coverage.

Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. — The damage left behind after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck Sparta on Aug. 9 was worse than initially thought, according to the Town of Sparta.  “We are hearing continuous rumbles throughout our community here in town and in Alleghany County, but we thank the Good Lord to this day that there have been no injuries or fatalities,” Mayor Wes Brinegar said during a Tuesday news conference. While damage assessments are still ongoing, the Town of Sparta had received about 525 reports of damage as of the close of business Monday, Emergency Management Director Daniel Shoffner said. 60 of these cases have been categorized as “major damage,” meaning they lost 40% or more in value. “We underestimated the damage and that was the number one thing. We were looking for major damage in our initial reports, but now, it’s coming out more and more with damage more widespread and severe,” Brinegar said. Brinegar said many of the people living in Sparta, especially those in the older population, are dealing with the emotional trauma that comes with having a natural disaster. And having 20 aftershocks since the earthquake hasn’t helped. “We’re still getting those aftershocks and those loud booms periodically. A lot of people are on edge right now and a lot of people have those issues because they’re paranoid right now,” Brinegar said. The Estep sisters didn’t return back to even look at the damage until Tuesday — more than a week after the quake. They own three side-by-side properties that have all been deemed unlivable. “Our parents were here first and all total 54 years,” Mary Estep said. In those 54 years, a lot of memories have been made there. “All the Christmas’ all the holidays, birthday, Thanksgiving was here,” Mary Estep said. In a matter of seconds, everything changed. “All of a sudden it was like a bomb went off. Everything was flying and shaking, and it was terrifying. Only thing I was thinking was, ‘I got to get her out of the kitchen,’” Mary Estep said. As the quake shook photos, books and home décor off the walls and shelves, she was in the living room frantically trying to get to her sister Alice Estep. “She was yelling ‘get out, get out.’ And I was saying ‘I’m right here, I’m right here,’” Alice Estep said. Hanging on to one another, the two women made it to the door only to find that it was blocked from the outside. A neighbor was able to get them out. They own these two homes and the apartments in the middle. All three properties are beyond repair. “This is a loss completely to us. We just don’t know where to turn, or what to do,” Alice Estep said. While it’s going to take months for some people, cleanup efforts have begun for those who’ve documented their damages. The emergency management report for damage assessment has been sent to state officials. “We are very much relying on state and federal officials to help put the people in this county,” said Daniel Roten, Alleghany County Emergency Management coordinator. He’s hopeful the county will get some money to assist individuals in this time of need. “As its been mentioned before, no one here had earthquake insurance — maybe a handful. I can count them on one hand,” Roten said. Unfortunately, with every tragedy, Brinegar said it seems like there’s someone trying to profit off of it. He said scammers are creating GoFundMe pages asking people to donate. The Red Cross is now housing 19 people from 10 families. The city doesn’t have an official GoFundMe for the victims. Brinegar said all assistance will go through the American Red Cross and they do have a fund called “Sparta Alleghany County North Carolina Earthquake.” Shoffner says the school system did sustain some damage during the earthquake. The school system has taken the necessary steps to ensure the safety of students and faculty.  The area felt eight tremors before the earthquake, as well as 20 aftershocks. The 5.1 earthquake centered in Sparta was felt across North Carolina.  Many who felt the earthquake said it lasted 10-15 seconds.

(WBTV) - A 2.9 magnitude earthquake has been the strongest of eight aftershocks reported since Sunday’s 5.1 near Sparta, North Carolina.  This is according to the United States Geological Survey.  USGS released their aftershock forecast soon after the major quake happened on Sunday. Before the 5.1 magnitude earthquake, the area had roughly eight smaller earthquakes starting Saturday, ranging from a magnitude 1.8 to a magnitude 2.6. Sunday’s 5.1 magnitude earthquake was felt by thousands of people in the Charlotte area. It is one of the largest earthquakes ever reported in the state.  The earthquake was recorded at a depth of 3.7 kilometers. USGS says the largest earthquake in the N.C. area occurred in 1916. As referenced in the United States Geological Survey Professional Paper 1527, in 1916 there was a magnitude 5.2 earthquake, with an intensity of VII (7) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, near Skyland in Buncombe County.

1985,What is an earthquake swarm? California's tremors explained,2020-08-11 20:30 UTC,https://www.inverse.com/science/earthquake-swarm-california-predictions-explained,"The chances of a big quake on the West coast are ""significantly greater than usual.""  Beginning Monday, parts of California were hit with an earthquake swarm that has scientists concerned that a larger-scale quake could be on its way.  Earthquake swarms are clusters of quakes occurring close to one another in both space and time. The earthquake swarm pinpointed to southern California began beneath the Salton Sea, located near Joshua Tree National Park. It's also located just south of the San Andreas fault — which stoked concerns over whether the swarm could trigger a larger-scale, more dangerous tremor.  As of Tuesday, the largest earthquake in the swarm has been a 4.6 magnitude. In the most likely scenario, subsequent quakes could reach a 5.4 magnitude, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). The chances of that being the largest quake are about 80 percent. The USGS expects the rate of earthquakes to drop in the next week or so. While the scenario of a 5.4 or lower quake is the most likely, the agency also estimates that, over the next seven days, there's a 19 percent chance of a 5.5 to 6.9 quake and a 1 percent chance of a quake with a magnitude of 7 or higher.    ""It's a really active area right there in the Sea. Lots of small earthquakes and they tend to be swarmy,"" Morgan Page, a research geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told LAist. ""In the past, these swarms have gone on for about a week or so.""  While earthquake swarms can cause some concern for those living near the area, these are naturally occurring events with some curious science behind them. Here's what you need to know.  They are clusters of earthquakes, which are typically on the smaller side, and tend to recur in the same areas — like the current swarm near the San Andreas fault. Most earthquake swarms are caused by geothermal activity.   Aftershocks occur after a larger ""mainshock"" earthquake happens on a fault. The phenomenon is part of the land readjusting after the main earthquake. This can last for just a few days or weeks — or it can happen for years after a very large earthquake.  In contrast, earthquake swarms don't have a detectable main event that triggers them. They tend to be smaller all-around, and short-lived in comparison to aftershocks.   ""No one can predict the exact time or place of any earthquake, including aftershocks or events in swarms,"" the USGS said in a statement about the ongoing earthquake swarm in California.    However, USGS does use forecasts to broadly understand the likelihood of earthquakes and swarms happening in the future. They use data from past tremors to make predictions including how long the swarm will last.   Is the ongoing earthquake swarm building toward the 'Big One'? — The California earthquake swarm is concerning because of its proximity to a major fault line. The swarm ""does increase the chance of a big earthquake on the San Andreas somewhat,” Morgan Page from USGS told the LA Times. “So it’s definitely something to watch.” Given the unpredictability of earthquakes, this does not necessarily mean that something bigger is on its way. However, as Inverse reported the last time this area had an earthquake swarm, preparing for the Big One is better than not — so if you're in an area potentially affected by earthquakes, it would be well-advised to visit the USGS site for tips on how to prepare.  ","The chances of a big quake on the West coast are ""significantly greater than usual.""  Beginning Monday, parts of California were hit with an earthquake swarm that has scientists concerned that a larger-scale quake could be on its way.

1988,5.1 magnitude earthquake rattles the Charlotte-area,2020-08-09 19:08 UTC,https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/weather/did-you-feel-an-earthquake-in-charlotte/275-c4e0828a-6b8a-4d45-9b90-0f82b4297382,"Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Did you feel that?  According to Chief Meteorologist Brad Panovich, a 5.1 magnitude earthquake was reported near Sparta, North Carolina Sunday morning at around 8 a.m.  Sunday's tremor was the location of Saturday's 2.3 magnitude earthquake. There were no immediate reports of injuries, though many people in Sparta shared photos and videos of minor damage caused by the earthquake.  The U.S. Geological Service said the quake’s epicenter was about 2.5 miles (four kilometers) southeast of Sparta. Panovich said this would be the biggest quake in North Carolina since the 5.1 magnitude quake in 1916 near Asheville. Some reports place it as the third-largest North Carolina earthquake on record.  Panovich said Saturday's 2.6 magnitude, in the same location, was a foreshock. Hours after the earthquake, two aftershocks were reported with one registering at 1.8 magnitude and another 1.7 magnitude.  ""I would expect many small aftershocks over the next few days,"" Panovich said. The chairman of the Alleghany County Board of Commissioners signed a declaration of a State of Emergency in Alleghany County in response to the earthquake.  ""I've never been so scared in my entire life,” said Sparta resident Erica Swenk. The aftermath left Swenk’s home in chaos.  ""My pictures and everything on the floor and all of the broken glass, immediately it just triggers emotions, those are your memories so I started crying,” Swenk said.  She said the shaking was so intense she wasn’t sure if she would survive, she’s thankful her kids were out of town. ""If I was going to see them again, I'm glad I lived through it and I've gotten to speak to them and know mommy’s okay and I think that's what's most important,” Swenk said. The earthquake was felt by many in the Charlotte area as well. Phil Brooks, a Charlotte resident, said he felt his bed shaking — saying he was ""pretty traumatized"" by the event.  Endora Crawford, another Charlotte resident, looked at it a little differently.  ""It's been that kind of year,"" Crawford said. ""Anything that happens is not a surprise."" Contributing information from the Associated Press. Who also felt that? A little ground rumbling this Sunday morning.

2032,Google turns Android phones into an earthquake detection network,2020-08-11 13:00 UTC,https://www.engadget.com/google-android-detect-earthquake-130041374.html,"In a natural disaster like an earthquake, even a few seconds’ heads up could save lives. You could use that time to get you and your loved ones somewhere safe and prevent fatalities and injuries. Google is rolling out a feature today that not only gives you an early warning about potential earthquakes happening, but also turns your phone into a mini seismometer and makes it part of a network of shockwave-detecting Android devices. “The public infrastructure to detect and alert everyone about an earthquake is costly to deploy,” Google’s principal software engineer of Android Marc Stogaitis said in a blog post today. Not everyone is signed up to receive text alerts, for example, so if the early warning system is built into the OS, these messages can reach more people. Google first collaborated with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services to send these alerts to Android devices in California via the USGS’ ShakeAlert system. This uses information gathered from more than 700 seismometers across the state to figure out when an earthquake is taking place. But it can be costly or challenging to install such a network in other impacted areas around the world, which is where the Android Earthquake Alerts System comes in. Users all over the world can opt into the program starting today. “Your Android phone can turn into a mini seismometer, joining millions of other Android phones out there to form the world’s largest earthquake detection network,” Stogaitis said. Google will use your phone’s accelerometer to detect the movement. Stogaitis said “They’re even sensitive enough to detect the P-wave, which is the first wave that comes out of an earthquake and is typically much less damaging than the S-wave which comes afterward.” When your device senses something, it’ll send a message to Google’s earthquake detection server with some rough location information as to where it happened. The server will then gather data from other devices to corroborate and see if an earthquake is happening. UC Berkeley created an app in 2016 called MyShake that did something similar, and it appears Google has borrowed this idea, making it better integrated into the OS and more widespread.Subscribe to the Engadget Deals NewsletterGreat deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget’s editorial team.

The results of this work will for now be displayed when you look for “earthquake” or “earthquake near me” to show you if Android phones around you are reporting similar activity. Stogaitis added that the search results will also surface tips from “helpful, credible resources” on what to do after an earthquake. He also said the earthquake detection system, which he described as a “crowdsourced approach,” was developed with seismology and disaster experts Dr. Richard Allen, Dr. Qingkai Kong and Dr. Lucy Jones. Earthquake alerts are rolling out in California first, since there’s already a great seismometer-based system in place.” Stogaitis said the feature will roll out to more states and regions using the Android-based detection over the coming year. Google had more to share today. Along with updates to Android Auto and the smartphone OS, the company is adding a language option to its Emergency Location Service feature. This allows you to share your phone’s language setting when you’re dialing a local emergency number, which can enable a dispatcher to be better prepared with a translator ready, getting you help faster.

2114,"Earthquake: 3.1 quake near Brawley, Calif.",2020-08-10 14:06 UTC,https://news.yahoo.com/earthquake-3-1-quake-near-140621012.html,"A swarm of mostly small earthquakes on Monday struck the Salton Sea area, one of the most seismically active areas of California.  More than a dozen temblors followed, one measuring 4.0 and several in the 3 range. Quake swarms are fairly common in this region, with some producing more than 1,000 small temblors. Scientists are carefully monitoring the series of quakes, as they are centered at the southern tip of the dangerous San Andreas fault. There is concern the swarm could trigger a larger event, a phenomenon that has occurred in that region in the past. Neil Driscoll, a geophysicist at UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, pointed to a chain reaction that occurred in November 1987 when a 6.2 quake on the Elmore Ranch fault near the Salton Sea triggered a 6.6 temblor just over 11 hours later on the Superstition Hills fault. Both quakes were widely felt in San Diego County. “We have had many swarms in that area over the years, and there has been no triggering of a fault, but we’re watching this closely,” said Driscoll. “We can’t say whether it is or isn’t going to trigger a larger earthquake.” Did you feel these earthquake? Consider reporting what you felt to the USGS. Even if you didn't feel this small earthquake, you never know when the Big One is going to strike. Ready yourself by following our five-step earthquake preparedness guide and building your own emergency kit.

Please enter a search term.       SPARTA, N.C. (WGHP) — People in North Carolina are still shaken after Sunday morning’s 5.1 magnitude earthquake.  In Sparta, North Carolina, it left a significant amount of damage downtown, with bricks falling off several buildings. “We had gotten woken up by a boom a little after two and couldn’t go back to sleep,” said Jacob Church, a Sparta resident. “At first it was like, ‘What’s going on?’ None of us were injured. I think it’s a cool thing to be a part of that,” said Brandon Lineberry, who was visiting at the time. The quake rattled a cemetery so hard, it uprooted headstones from the ground. Just a few miles from downtown, the North Carolina Department of Transportation was dealing with the damage to a water main. “We’re just trying to get it back open. It’s buckled up the road a little from the water main, from the earthquake, and we’re just trying to get it back to normal,” said Jeffery Jones, with the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The damage was significant at Scott’s Landscaping Nursery and Farms, leaving several cracks in the parking lot and shattering pottery. “It’s been a rough morning. You don’t expect anything like this to happen here because it doesn’t happen here,” said owner Scott Smith, adding that “2020 has been a rough year for a lot of people.” The mayor of Sparta, Wes Brinegar, issued a state of emergency Sunday after the earthquake hit. No injuries had been reported.  The mayor said Sunday there was widespread minor damage to homes, with structures and chimneys being knocked off.  Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

2117,Did your pet seem to 'know' the earthquake was coming?,2020-08-09 19:57 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/09/did-your-pet-seem-know-earthquake-was-coming/,"(WBTV) - Did your pet act strangely before the Earth started shaking during this morning’s earthquake? Stefanie Scism asked WBTV anchor Maureen O’Boyle in an email, “Did anyone else report their dogs acting crazy this morning BEFORE the shaking?” For centuries, people have shared observations just like Scism’s, according to the United States Geological Survey, with people recalling the moments before an earthquake when animals exhibited bizarre behavior. This is what Scism says happened to her Sunday morning. “I have 3 dogs and the only reason I was up is they were trying to climb on me,” she said. “They NEVER do that.” We’ll get to what seismologists say about this in a moment. But it turns out Scism’s experience this morning was not unique. Soon after the earthquake, WBTV First Alert Meteorologist Leigh Brock was on Facebook Live explaining to viewers what they had just experienced. It was a 5.1 magnitude earthquake, the epicenter in Sparta, North Carolina. As Brock was sharing her knowledge, viewers started sharing their experiences. Some talked specifically about their pets. “There wasn’t a lot of talk at that point of damage,” Brock said. “But a lot of viewers were saying their dogs were barking and running around and acting strange."" After experiencing something similar in California in the mid-90′s during an earthquake, O’Boyle wanted to believe her dog “knew” the earthquake was coming. O’Boyle remembers it like it was yesterday. She was living in a home in the hills above West Hollywood. Her three-year-old mutt Sammy started arching his back and lifting his paws like the ground was suddenly hot. That was immediately followed by deep howling sound. It was bizarre, to say the least. Then, boom. O’Boyle’s house didn’t shake. She described it more as a giant “thud,” as if the house was a boat making a sudden bump into the dock. O’Boyle wanted to believe her dog was trying to “warn” her of what was coming. But our pets will never cause seismologists to lose their jobs.  “We can easily explain the cause of unusual animal behavior seconds before humans feel an earthquake,” according to an article on the USGS web site. “Very few humans notice the smaller P wave that travels the fastest from the earthquake source and arrives before the larger S wave. But many animals with more keen senses are able to feel the P wave seconds before the S wave arrives. As for sensing an impending earthquake days or weeks before it occurs, that’s a different story,” the article explains,” the article continued. So yes, there is something to it. That “P wave” may be why your dog, like all three of Scism’s did things they never do moments before the Earth started to move. It would be wonderful if animals could “warn” us when an earthquake is coming, but we would need more than seconds. The USGS writes, “However, consistent and reliable behavior prior to seismic events, and a mechanism explaining how it could work, still eludes us.” Copyright 2020 WBTV.

2125,"In 1981, scientists predicted an earthquake like the one that rattled the Alaska Peninsula this week",2020-07-25 19:49 UTC,https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/science/2020/07/25/in-1981-scientists-predicted-an-earthquake-like-the-one-that-rattled-the-alaska-peninsula-this-week/,"Late Tuesday, state seismologist Michael West heard a text alarm. His phone informed him of a large earthquake beneath the ocean, just south of the Alaska Peninsula, about 60 miles southeast of the village of Sand Point. His first thought was that this — the biggest earthquake on the planet so far in 2020 — would cause a devastating tsunami. His second thought was that a longstanding earthquake mystery may have just been solved.  West and his colleagues at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute were still awash in data one day after the event. But he was quick to point out a scientific paper written by the first Alaska state seismologist, John Davies, in 1981. All the large recent earthquakes on the Aleutian Subduction Zone, including the magnitude 7.8 in the “Shumagin Gap” that occurred July 21, 2020. (Graphic courtesy Alaska Earthquake Center)  In it, Davies and his co-workers proposed a “seismic gap” just south of Sand Point. There, they wrote, was a swath of one of the world’s great subduction zones that had not ruptured in a long time. It was perhaps due. Davies made his prediction after field campaigns in the 1970s, during which he and his co-workers had installed seismometers near Popof Island, upon which the village of Sand Point (population 1,140) sits. “From 1938 to 1965, almost the entirety of the Alaska subduction zone ruptured,” West said. “There were only two places that didn’t rip — one in the Yakutat area and another in the Shumagin Islands (where the July 21 earthquake occurred). “Here, you have this 1981 paper that says you’ve ruptured everything except these sections, and that’s where you should expect the next big earthquake.” [Alaska quake that prompted tsunami evacuations, but no big wave, may offer clue in scientific debate]  “The Pacific Plate is careening northwestward a couple of inches each year into the stronger North American Plate,” he said. “This forces the Pacific Plate to thrust down under Alaska. Major earthquakes happen at the boundary where these two plates rub together.” John Davies, who wrote the paper predicting an earthquake like the one that happened Tuesday night, was elected to the Alaska State Legislature in 1993. He then had to resign from his position at the Geophysical Institute, where, like West, he was the state seismologist. Davies’ doctorate work, executed in Skwentna, Alaska, helped prove the newish theory of plate tectonics, in which scientists like his mentor David Stone had argued that Earth’s crust is composed of colossal blocks shoving into one another. Davies showed that the Pacific Plate was indeed diving deep beneath Anchorage, and reached almost to Denali. After turning to politics, Davis never went back to seismology. The day after the 2020 earthquake, he and his wife, Linda Schandelmeier, were making kimchi from Napa cabbage they had harvested from their garden in Fairbanks. Reached by phone, Davies said he was happy to hear that his research of decades ago was suddenly relevant. “That would be really gratifying if that turned out to be true,” Davies said. West said the shadow of aftershocks from the earthquake were enough for him to believe that a significant portion of the Shumagin Gap had ruptured, and was perhaps not just some quirky section that slips quietly without major earthquakes. Davies, who as state seismologist had a duty to find the areas of greatest earthquake risk and advise about building codes and warn of tsunami hazards, said large earthquakes somewhat remind him of current times. “Earthquakes are like viruses — the really big ones come along once in a lifetime, if at all,” he said. “We have these hazards that occur with such a long time between them. It’s hard to get people to pay attention.” [Because of a high volume of comments requiring moderation, we are temporarily disabling comments on many of our articles so editors can focus on the coronavirus crisis and other coverage.

There were no immediate reports of damage in the sparsely populated area of the state, and a tsunami warning was canceled after the magnitude 7.8 quake off the Alaska Peninsula produced a wave of less than a foot.  Because of its location, nearby communities along the Alaska Peninsula did not experience shaking that would normally be associated with that magnitude of a quake, said Michael West, Alaska State Seismologist. Get breaking news alerts in the FOX5NY News app. It is FREE! Download for iOS or Android  “No reports of any damage,” Kodiak Police Sgt. Mike Sorter told The Associated Press early Wednesday morning. “No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal.” Kodiak is about 200 miles northeast of where the earthquake was centered. The tsunami warning had coastal residents evacuating for higher ground. Social media posts showed long lines of people fleeing towns like Homer and Kodiak while tsunami sirens wailed in the background. On Kodiak Island, the local high school opened its doors for evacuees, as did the local Catholic school, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “We’ve got a high school full of people,” said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. “I’ve been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,” he told the Daily News. “Everything’s as calm as can be. We’ve got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,” he said before the warning was canceled. Tsunami warnings are commonplace for people who grew up in Kodiak. ”I’ve been doing these since I was a little kid,” LeDoux told the newspaper. “Old news.” Officials at the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, began calling off tsunami advisories and warnings after a wave of only 25 centimeters (.8 foot) was recorded in the community of Sand Point. “I might have expected a little bit more water, but I’m happy that there wasn’t,” said David Hale, the senior duty scientist at the tsunami center. Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that caused damage in the Anchorage area in November 2018. “This earthquake released about 15 times as much energy as that earthquake, said West, the state seismologist. More than a dozen aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or higher were reported immediately after the earthquake, he said by telephone from the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ”We got people here who are going be working all night,” West said early Wednesday morning. ”These aftershocks will go and go and go and go.” The Alaska-Aleutian Trench was also where a magnitude 9.2 quake in 1964 was centered. That remains the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded. The temblor and ensuing tsunami caused widespread damage and killed 131 people, some as far away as Oregon and California. Alaska is the most actively seismic state. Nearly 25,000 earthquakes have been recorded in Alaska since Jan. 1, according to the center.

That increases the likelihood of a big shake-up on the larger San Andreas fault to 1.15%.Those low probabilities may seem hardly worth worrying about given more pressing concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the numbers translate into a near tripling of the odds of a large quake on the San Andreas, one of the study's co-authors told The Times.Ross Stein, an earthquake scientist emeritus of the U.S. Geological Survey and adjunct professor of geophysics at Stanford University told the newspaper that if the Garlock fault ruptures, the probability of a big earthquake along the San Andreas fault could be even odds.""Now, you can think of the Ridgecrest earthquake as being so far from Greater Los Angeles ... that it is nearly harmless,"" Stein told The Times.""But the problem is that ... the Ridgecrest earthquake brought the Garlock fault closer to rupture. If that fault ruptures -- and it gets within about 25 miles of the San Andreas -- then there's a high likelihood, maybe a 50/50 shot, that it would immediately rupture on the San Andreas.""A hypothetical magnitude 7.8 quake on the San Andreas could cause more than 1,800 deaths, injure 5,000, displace 500,000 to 1 million people from their homes and cripple the region economically for a generation, The Times reported.A quake of that magnitude would produce 45 times more energy than the 1994 magnitude 6.7 Northridge quake.Another seismologist, not involved in the study, said its conclusions are not confirmed.""It's really interesting science, and I like the way they've been able to increase the complexity of how they do their modeling,"" Lucy Jones told the newspaper. ""That's a real advance. But it's not yet proven.""However, even Jones said California officials should be prepared and on the lookout for action on the Garlock fault.The series of earthquakes in Ridgecrest in 2019 culminated in the largest seismic event in the state since the 1999 7.1 magnitude Hector Mine quake, according to an abstract of the report.The Ridgecrest activity ""produced significant stress perturbations on nearby fault networks, especially along the Garlock fault segment immediately southwest of the 2019 Ridgecrest rupture,"" according to that brief summary.The question is whether that stress may have begun a chain of events that could result in a widespread devastation along the San Andreas fault not seen since 1857, The Times noted.A year ago, the U.S. Geological Survey -- the nation's primary earthquake science agency -- calculated that there was an extremely remote chance the San Andreas could be triggered by the Ridgecrest quakes, the newspaper reported.     Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     In Other News Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings.","That increases the likelihood of a big shake-up on the larger San Andreas fault to 1.15%.Those low probabilities may seem hardly worth worrying about given more pressing concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the numbers translate into a near tripling of the odds of a large quake on the San Andreas, one of the study's co-authors told The Times.Ross Stein, an earthquake scientist emeritus of the U.S. Geological Survey and adjunct professor of geophysics at Stanford University told the newspaper that if the Garlock fault ruptures, the probability of a big earthquake along the San Andreas fault could be even odds.""Now, you can think of the Ridgecrest earthquake as being so far from Greater Los Angeles ...",Ridgecrest,35.6308,-117.6622

     Mexico hit by magnitude 7.4 earthquake that triggered a tsunami alert for Pacific coastlines along Central America. The powerful earthquake that rocked southern Mexico on Tuesday is now blamed for at least six deaths, including a worker at the country's largest oil refinery, according to officials.  “We lost everything in one moment to nature,” said Vicente Romero, an owner of a stationery store in the resort town of La Crucecita who told Reuters his home suffered structural damage. “This is our life’s work."" MAGNITUDE 7.4 EARTHQUAKE STRIKES MEXICO, AT LEAST 2 DEAD IN BUILDING COLLAPSES The national Civil Protection Center said right before midnight a sixth fatality was reported in the southern state of Oaxaca, the epicenter of the quake where at least 500 homes were damaged. A magnitude 7.4 earthquake in southern Mexico was felt several hundred miles away. (Fox News) Among the dead were a worker at Mexico's largest oil refinery who fell from one of the plant's structures, according to the civil protection agency.

THE ""RING OF FIRE' EXPLAINED At least six people were injured, including two in Mexico City, more than 300 miles north of the epicenter, where the shaking sent tens of thousands of people fleeing into the streets.  Officials told El Universal that at least 10 health centers, already busy battling the coronavirus pandemic, sustained damage from the tremors. Eight hospitals scattered along the coast in Oaxaca were the most severely affected. ""Unfortunately, the earthquake was significant enough to cause damage to the ceilings, doors, facilities and walls, but the reports I have so far are that there are no structural damages,"" Oaxaca Deputy Director of Health Services Juan Carlos Marquez Heine told the news outlet.

Let’s pray for them. May the help of God and our brothers give them strength and support. Brothers and sisters, I am very close to you,” he said at his weekly general audience. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Mexico's Pacific coast is located along the volatile ""Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of fault lines around the ocean. The region has most of Earth's subduction zones, where oceanic plates slide under the lighter continental plates. Earthquakes can occur when those plates scrape or subside underneath each other. At sea, it can spawn tsunamis. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region of Mexico where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 magnitude 8.0 quake.

A small magnitude-2.7 earthquake struck Berkeley, Calif., Tuesday morning, with an epicenter under the edge of UC Berkeley campus. A map from the United States Geological Survey shows the quake hit just east of the California Memorial Stadium.  Residents in the area reported feeling the slightest shaking. There was no initial word on damage or injury resulting from the quake. More information on this earthquake is available on the USGS event page. A handful of major faults cut through the Bay Area, and many experts believe the 52-mile-long Hayward Fault stretching from San Pablo Bay in the north, to just east of San Jose in the south, is among the most dangerous in the world as it passes directly through a highly populated area. Due to the Hayward Fault's vulnerability, the USGS imagined the outcome of a magnitude 7.0 tremor on the fault in a 2018 report. The ""Haywired scenario"" estimates up to 800 people could die and 18,000 could be injured if the fault were to rupture.  Homes would be engulfed in flames, with an estimated 52,000 homes burning. Twenty-thousand people could be stuck in elevators and 1,500 could be trapped in fallen buildings. Also on Tuesday morning, a 4.2 quake struck in western Nevada about 23 miles from Mina.

While 2.4 is a bit stronger than most North State earthquakes, it's considered quite small, according to USGS earthquake geologist Alex Hatem.  Wee quakes are common in the North State, she said. ""You (Shasta and Siskiyou counties) are in a volcanic area, which can be prone to having small earthquakes."" According to the USGS, there have been about a dozen tremors recorded by the USGS since Aug. 11 in the area stretching from Red Bluff to Mount Shasta and from Hayfork to Lassen Peak. Other than the one recorded near French Gulch, none had a magnitude over 1.8.  A 2.4 earthquake is usually hard to feel unless you are in bed close to the epicenter, being very still, Hatem said. ""Walking around, you probably would not have felt it."" A post on Facebook asked if anyone felt the earthquake. As of 11 a.m. Friday, no one reported knowing it had happened. The USGS recommends people get under a table and cover their head if they feel an earthquake, Hatem said.  This week, the USGS launched a Twitter account for people to track earthquakes, said Paul Laustsen, public affairs specialist at the USGS’ Earthquake Science Center. Go to @USGS_Quakes to follow.

2256,There was a 'boomerang earthquake' in 2016. Here's what that means,2020-08-12 13:00 UTC,https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2020/8/12/21363312/boomerang-earthquake-atlantic-ocean,"A ‘boomerang earthquake’ hit the Atlantic Ocean. Here’s what it means Adobe Stock  Earthquakes can apparently turn around and hit an area with a second pass — an event known as a “boomerang earthquake” — in rare circumstances.  Scientists recently found evidence of the “boomerang earthquake” in a new study, highlighting an event that happened in the Atlantic Ocean back in 2016. The earthquake — which took place at the Romanche fracture zone — happened between Brazil and the west coast of Africa. There was a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in August 2016. The tremor traveled one direction and then it came back around for a second strike, bringing an increase of speed on the second strike, according to ScienceAlert. Or, described another way, “the rupture initially spreads away from initial break but then turns and runs back the other way at higher speeds,” according to Phys.org. “Whilst scientists have found that such a reversing rupture mechanism is possible from theoretical models, our new study provides some of the clearest evidence for this enigmatic mechanism occurring in a real fault,” said Stephen Hicks, lead researcher and seismologist from Imperial College London.  “Even though the fault structure seems simple, the way the earthquake grew was not, and this was completely opposite to how we expected the earthquake to look before we started to analyze the data.” The earthquake had two phases. The first traveled eastward before coming back around and going westward.  This, of course, is the first reported incident of a boomerang earthquake. It’s so rare that it’s unlikely to find one again unless researchers seek it out, according to National Geographic. Evidence is growing of these events. But more research is needed to discover more. “The theory says that it’s there, but it’s quite difficult to see that (in the real world),” said geophysicist Louisa Brotherson, a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Liverpool in the U.K., who simulates earthquakes.

2257,Do you need earthquake insurance?,2020-08-11 14:23 UTC,https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/local/earthquake-insurance-is-a-thing-in-nc-why-you-cant-buy-it-right-now/83-673947b6-c5ae-4bfc-880b-338ab2f5cfb2,"Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     GREENSBORO, N.C. — “We started last week with a hurricane and we ended the week with an earthquake. I don't think people have a clue as to what is not in their insurance policy,” said Christopher Cook with Alliance Insurance Services. What is not in your standard homeowners insurance policy? Flooding, earthquake damage, and wind damage. For example, damage from Sunday’s earthquake would not be covered unless the homeowner had earthquake coverage. Most folks don’t have this extra coverage. Cook says only two of his 4,000 customers have earthquake coverage. And right now, even if you had the money to buy coverage, you can’t get it. “We've already had companies come out to us and say do not issue insurance for seven days, they need to see what is going to happen before there are policies issued. Then there is a two-week waiting period before we do that. You have to be cognizant that if the ground is still shaking, companies aren't going to let you add coverage,"" added Cook.   Cook says it's worth having your insurance agent run the numbers for you-- so you can decide if you think the risk is worth it. Much like earthquake insurance, you can’t get flood insurance right before a storm is coming. Christopher Cook said, ""I get this question all the time, it starts like, ‘Hey there is a massive storm in the Bahamas and it looks like it is coming to us. I need to add flood insurance’. My answer is, ‘I'll be happy to add flood insurance for you, today is August 10, you'll have coverage September 11’.” There is a 30 day waiting period for flood coverage to go into effect. Even if you don’t think you need earthquake or flood coverage, if you haven't really looked at it in a couple of years, you should and ask your insurance agent questions, because you might think you're covered when you're not. “Insurance pays for things that were sudden and accidental by nature but if you've had a leak in your shower for five years and now you have mold in your wall and your subfloor is collapsing into your crawl space, that happened over a long, long, long period of time, it wasn’t sudden and accidental, your insurance company is not going to pay for it,"" said Cook.  Your hot water heater isn’t working anymore. Doesn’t your policy pay for that? Christopher Cook explained a common misconception. “Something that is common that people reach out to us about is maintenance items. If your hot water heater is 20 years old and it fails, it was built to last 20 years. It's part of homeownership, it stinks but your insurance doesn’t cover mechanical failures of systems in your home.” Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings.","I don't think people have a clue as to what is not in their insurance policy,” said Christopher Cook with Alliance Insurance Services.

2258,Sunday's Bible reading described a powerful earthquake. Then the ground shook in NC,2020-08-11 02:50 UTC,https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/10/sundays-bible-reading-described-powerful-earthquake-then-ground-shook-nc/,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - It was time for the first reading at Sunday’s 8 a.m. outdoor Mass that St. Gabriel Catholic Church in Charlotte has been holding during the pandemic.  After the wind there was an earthquake — but the LORD was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake there was fire — but the LORD was not in the fire. After the fire there was a tiny whispering sound. Father Richard Sutter, pastor at St. Gabriel near SouthPark, said as the reader got to the earthquake verses, several attendees felt the ground shake.  While he didn’t feel it himself, Sutter said parishioners came up to him as soon as the service ended. Some may call it a coincidence — or “God-incidence” as Sutter put it — but the priest said the jarring moment can be a lesson for this time. “When there’s fear from an earthquake, when there’s fear from a storm, when there’s fear from a pandemic and uncertainty... you have to let the Lord speak to us the truth,” he said. In fact, Catholics around the globe read the same passage from 1 Kings that weekend, planned well in advance of Sunday’s quake. ‘A GOOD MESSAGE’ Closer to the epicenter, Father Cory Catron was preparing for another Sunday of services since becoming pastor for churches in Sparta and nearby Jefferson in late July. He was in Jefferson, about 25 miles from Sparta, when the church doors and windows shook. It made for “good homily material,” he said with a laugh, the levity possible because the church was unscathed and parishioners reported only minor property damage.  “The ceiling creaked for like three seconds, and everybody kind of looked up and immediately we knew what it was,” he said. Catron said the timely passage from scripture teaches that in this time of pandemics, financial worry and natural disasters, to slow down. “God is found in the stillness and God is found in the silence,” he said. “We have to cultivate that silence, which is a very difficult thing to do. “It’s a good message that it doesn’t matter how how strange and messed up and scary everything can be, that God is still present to us.” Copyright 2020 The Charlotte Observer.

(AP) — The most powerful earthquake to hit North Carolina in more than 100 years shook much of the state early Sunday, rattling homes, businesses and residents.  There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Michael Hull was standing in his driveway at his home in Sparta when he noticed a group of deer running. “Not even a minute passed and the side-to-side motion started,” Hull said. “It takes you a minute to realize what’s happening, and you just can’t believe it. Then it was over. It was loud, like God was shaking a mountain at you, literally.” Karen Backer was in her Greensboro apartment when she heard initially mistook banging in her kitchen for her roommate. “Nope, it was the cabinet doors ‘clinking’ open and closed! My neighbors on the other hand said they felt our apartment building shaking,” Backer said. “Well, sadly, nothing surprises me in 2020, but a hurricane and an earthquake in the same week is crazy.” It was the largest earthquake to hit the state since 1916, when a magnitude 5.5 quake occurred near Skyland, the weather service said. The U.S. Geological Service said the quake’s epicenter was about 2.5 miles (four kilometers) southeast of Sparta, just south of the Virginia-North Carolina border. The USGS said the population in the affected region resides in structures “that are resistant to earthquake shaking, though vulnerable structures exist.” The quake was felt in nearby states including Virginia, South Carolina and Tennessee.

Please enter a search term.     ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A powerful earthquake off Alaska’s southern coast jolted coastal communities late Tuesday, and some residents briefly scrambled for higher ground over fears of a tsunami. There were no immediate reports of damage in the sparsely populated area of the state, and the tsunami warning was canceled after the magnitude 7.8 quake off the Alaska Peninsula produced a wave of a less than a foot.  Because of the temblor’s location, nearby communities along the Alaska Peninsula did not experience shaking that would normally be associated with that magnitude of a quake, said Michael West, Alaska State Seismologist. That doesn’t mean they slept through it, West said residents in small towns within a hundred miles (160 kilometers) of the quake reported very strong shaking. Some shaking was also felt more than 500 miles (805 kilometers) away in the Anchorage area, West said. “No reports of any damage,” Kodiak Police Sgt. Mike Sorter said early Wednesday morning. “No injuries were reported. Everything is nominal.” Kodiak is about 200 miles (320 kilometers) northeast of where the earthquake was centered. The tsunami warning prompted coastal residents to evacuate to higher ground, with social media posts showing long lines of people fleeing towns like Homer and Kodiak as tsunami sirens wailed in the background. On Kodiak Island, the local high school and Catholic opened their doors for evacuees, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “We’ve got a high school full of people,” said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. “I’ve been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,” he told the Daily News. “Everything’s as calm as can be. We’ve got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,” he said before the warning was canceled. Tsunami warnings are commonplace for people who grew up in Kodiak. ”I’ve been doing these since I was a little kid,” LeDoux told the newspaper. “Old news.” Officials at the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, began calling off tsunami advisories and warnings after a wave of less than 1 foot (30 centimeters) was recorded in the community of Sand Point. “I might have expected a little bit more water, but I’m happy that there wasn’t,” said David Hale, the senior duty scientist at the tsunami center. Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that caused damage in the Anchorage area in November 2018. “This earthquake released about 15 times as much energy as that earthquake, said West, the state seismologist. More than a dozen aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or higher were reported immediately after the earthquake, he said from the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ”We got people here who are going be working all night,” West said early Wednesday morning. ”These aftershocks will go and go and go and go.” The Alaska-Aleutian Trench was also where a magnitude 9.2 quake in 1964 was centered. That remains the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded. The temblor and ensuing tsunami caused widespread damage and killed 131 people, some as far away as Oregon and California. Alaska is the most actively seismic state. Nearly 25,000 earthquakes have been recorded in Alaska since Jan. 1, according to the center.

2285,Strong earthquake prompts tsunami warning from Alaska Peninsula to western Kenai,2020-07-22 07:17 UTC,https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2020/07/21/strong-earthquake-prompts-tsunami-warning-from-alaska-peninsula-to-western-kenai/,"  The tsunami warning originally stretched from the Alaska Peninsula to Kodiak Island and the western Kenai Peninsula, sending Alaskans scrambling to higher ground in communities such as Kodiak, Sand Point, Unalaska and Homer. Though some people in Anchorage received tsunami warning alerts, the Anchorage area was not at risk, said Louise Fode, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service. In its notice of the tsunami warning cancellation, the National Tsunami Warning Center said that “a tsunami was generated by this event, but no longer poses a threat. Some areas may continue to see small sea level changes.” The center also urged people not to return to hazard zones until local officials say it is safe to do so. James Gridley, director of the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, said in an interview early Wednesday that “our procedures put us into a warning even if we haven’t measured a tsunami wave — we imply that there is until we know better.”   “This is a very significant earthquake in size,” said Michael West, state seismologist with the Alaska Earthquake Center. The Tuesday night earthquake was “something like 15 times more energy than was released in the 2018 Anchorage earthquake,” he said. But since it happened offshore, there was much less shaking recorded, and West said earthquake center officials weren’t expecting damage from shaking. The kind of earthquake that occurred Tuesday evening was typical for the southern coast of Alaska, West said. It’s also the same style — “more or less,” West said — as the Great Alaska Earthquake of 1964. “These are the style of earthquakes which can be very tsunami-producing,” West said.

(Larry LeDoux photo)  In Kodiak, tsunami warning sirens sounded Tuesday night and residents headed to high ground. Kodiak High School opened its doors for evacuees, as did the local Catholic school. At Coast Guard base Kodiak, residents were instructed to head to Aviation Hill, high ground overlooking the nearby airport. The local public radio station reminded evacuees to carry masks. “We’ve got a high school full of people. I’ve been passing out masks since the first siren sounded,” said Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak School District. ”Everything’s as calm as can be. We’ve got probably 300, 400 people all wearing masks,” he said.  At Kodiak High School, LeDoux said the sirens and evacuations were nothing out of the ordinary for someone who grew up in Kodiak. ”I’ve been doing these since I was a little kid,” he said. “Old news.” In the first minutes of a seismic event, there aren’t usually enough ocean sensors to measure a tsunami wave, said Gridley with the National Tsunami Warning Center. You have to give it time to get to nearby sensors, he said, but if there’s a wave, beaches and shorelines could be impacted before then. “We have to assume the worst case scenario,” Gridley said. “The safest position is to get people moving.” It’s not like a hurricane that forms out in the ocean, days away from shore, he said — they have to go straight to a warning.

(Megan Pacer/Homer Tribune via AP)  On Tuesday, the center issued its tsunami warning and kept the warning in place after seeing a 25-centimeter wave in Sand Point. Center officials knew the tsunami wouldn’t be huge, Gridley said, but they had to be certain and wait for the entire wave cycle. “If we just start seeing a little bump, we don’t know if that bump is going to get much bigger, or if that was it,” Gridley said. After about an hour and a half Tuesday, the tsunami advisories for certain areas outside of the warning zones were canceled, Gridley said. “We just had to wait long enough to see whether or not we would see more of a wave develop or not,” Gridley said. “And the answer was no.” The center canceled the tsunami warning, which grew to stretch from the Aleutian Islands to the Western Kenai, a little under two hours after it issued its initial warning. Unalaska City Manager Erin Reinders said the city activated its emergency operations center Tuesday night and notified the community to evacuate areas below 50 feet to higher ground, before later issuing the all-clear. ”We were in a (city) council meeting and started feeling it rocking, and by the time I got home from the council meeting then the warnings were going and had to turn back around,” Reinders said.  ”This is a developing situation, and we are monitoring closely the information that is coming from the state and federal agencies that we’re collaborating with,” Ahlberg said before the tsunami warning was canceled. “So at this juncture, I’m not putting a time stamp on it.” In Homer, sirens blared late Tuesday night, alerting residents to the tsunami threat.

     Seismologist warns the event isn't over and it's possible there could be even a stronger earthquake on the way; Jeff Paul reports. Scientists have warned that last year’s Ridgecrest quakes in Southern California have increased the risk of a major San Andreas Fault earthquake. The quakes, warn catastrophe modeling company Temblor, have placed stress on the Garlock Fault that links the Ridgecrest Faults with the San Andreas Fault. In a blog post, Temblor CEO Ross Stein and Shinji Toda of Tohoku University explained that if the Garlock Fault ruptured in a large shock, “it would likely trigger a San Andreas earthquake north of Los Angeles.” A paper on the research has been published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America. MAJOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FAULT LINE EYED AFTER STUDY SHOWS UNPRECEDENTED MOVEMENT “In our study, we developed a new method to forecast future seismicity,” Stein and Toda wrote in the post. “These forecasts are not earthquake predictions, which have so far proven impossible. Rather, they are probabilistic, framed in the language of chance. We use past seismicity, the stress imparted by recent large and moderate earthquakes and the equations governing how fault friction varies in time and space (‘rate-state friction’) to estimate the likelihood of future earthquakes of different sizes.” The 9.3-mile deep San Andreas Fault in California is one of the longest and most active in the world. This computer-generated image is enhanced to show its features - illustration. (SRTM, JPL, NASA) The experts used machine learning technology in their analysis, which estimates a 2.3 percent chance of a magnitude-7.7 Garlock Fault rupture in the next year. “This is 100 times higher than its annual chances in the ‘UCERF3’ benchmark model for California, which is jointly issued by the [U.S. Geological Survey], the Southern California Earthquake Center, and the California Geological Survey,” Stein and Toda wrote. The scientists calculate that if the Garlock Fault ruptured to within about 30 miles of its junction with the San Andreas Fault, “it would raise the probability of a San Andreas rupture extending to the southeast, on the so-called ‘Mojave section,’ by a factor of about 150.”  “That translates into a 50/50 chance of a San Andreas Mojave section rupture (with a range, 25 percent-67 percent), either immediately following a Garlock quake, or after some delay,” they added. Part of the visible section of the San Andreas Fault. (AP) Set against this backdrop, they estimate that the net chance of a large San Andreas earthquake in the next 12 months is 1.15 percent. “While small, this probability is 3.5-5.0 times higher than the annual chance of a large San Andreas earthquake in the ‘UCERF3’ benchmark model for California,” they added. Given the small likelihood of a large San Andreas earthquake in the next year, the scientists say no one should panic. “But, as we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, low probability chain-reaction events do occur in nature, and when they do, their consequences can be great,” they explained. “It is the responsibility of scientists to assess the likelihood of such events, and then to bring them to the attention of the public and decision-makers.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Seismologist Lucy Jones, who was not involved in the study, described the analysis as “elegant” in a tweet, but added that it “assumes a reason for quake triggering that is not consensus.” “The possibility of a San Andreas quake AT ANY TIME should already be part of your planning or you shouldn't be in California,” she wrote, in another tweet.

Scientists have warned that last year’s Ridgecrest quakes in Southern California have increased the risk of a major San Andreas Fault earthquake.
In a blog post, Temblor CEO Ross Stein and Shinji Toda of Tohoku University explained that if the Garlock Fault ruptured in a large shock, “it would likely trigger a San Andreas earthquake north of Los Angeles.” A paper on the research has been published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America.
We use past seismicity, the stress imparted by recent large and moderate earthquakes and the equations governing how fault friction varies in time and space (‘rate-state friction’) to estimate the likelihood of future earthquakes of different sizes.” The 9.3-mile deep San Andreas Fault in California is one of the longest and most active in the world.
The scientists calculate that if the Garlock Fault ruptured to within about 30 miles of its junction with the San Andreas Fault, “it would raise the probability of a San Andreas rupture extending to the southeast, on the so-called ‘Mojave section,’ by a factor of about 150.”  “That translates into a 50/50 chance of a San Andreas Mojave section rupture (with a range, 25 percent-67 percent), either immediately following a Garlock quake, or after some delay,” they added.

2287,"Powerful earthquake shakes southern Mexico, at least 4 dead",2020-06-24 01:06 UTC,https://www.krgv.com/news/powerful-earthquake-shakes-southern-mexico-at-least-4-dead,"By MARÍA VERZA and CHRISTOPHER SHERMAN Associated Press MEXICO CITY (AP) — A powerful earthquake centered near the southern Mexico resort of Huatulco killed at least four people, swayed buildings in Mexico City and sent thousands fleeing into the streets. Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed and another injured in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise he said reports were of minor damage from the magnitude 7.4 quake, including broken windows and collapsed walls. Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat later said a second person was killed in an apparent house collapse in the tiny mountain village of San Juan Ozolotepec.  Pemex also said the quake caused a fire at its refinery in the Pacific coast city of Salina Cruz, relatively near the epicenter. It said one worker was injured and the flames were quickly extinguished. Churches, bridges and highways also suffered damage during the quake. López Obrador said there had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out to some areas. Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Inside a Mexico City military barracks converted to COVID-19 hospital, medical staff suited in protective equipment tried to calm anxious patients. Unable to evacuate isolation areas, patients huddled under a large beam in the women’s ward while a nurse tried to calm one having a panic attack. Teresa Juárez could only wish for it to pass quickly from her hospital bed where she lay connected to oxygen. Diabetic and with high blood pressure, Juárez said she thought about her five children. “It’s horrible, you’re here and you don’t know what to do,” she said.  It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico. In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings. Mari González of the Princess Mayev hotel in Huatulco said staff and guests were able to evacuate the building before the quake, but that 45 minutes after the initial quake they were still outside as strong aftershocks continued. “It was strong, very strong,” she said. González said there was some visible broken glass and mirrors, but no major damage. The staff was waiting for the aftershocks to dissipate before fully evaluating the property. Local news media reported damage to some buildings in the state capital, Oaxaca city. State officials said they were looking for damage. The USGS estimated that some 2 million people felt strong or moderate shaking and another 49 million felt weak or light shaking. The earthquake hit a quake-prone region where four underground tectonic plates come together. In the past 35 years, there have been at least seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes, killing around 10,000 people — most of them in a 1985 8.0 quake. “This has the potential to be a deadly earthquake and cause significant damage,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “This area is capable of and has had larger earthquakes in the past.” “There will be aftershocks,” Earle said. “It is not unexpected to see a magnitude 6 at this point and a number of smaller ones.” This quake happened when the Cocos plate, which is to the southwest of the area, slipped under the North American plate, Earle said. “You’ve got all sorts of plates and they’re moving quickly,” Earle said. “The important thing is how fast the plates are moving relative to each other.” The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a tsunami threat with waves three to 10 feet above tide levels along parts of the coasts of Mexico. Smaller waves were expected through Central America, Peru and Ecuador. Guatemala’s national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert for its southern Pacific coast forecasting the arrival of waves up to a meter high. It advised people to move away from the sea. __ Associated Press writers Chris Torchia in Mexico City and Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.

Please enter a search term. A 7.4 magnitude earthquake occurred June 23, 2020 along the southern coastline of Mexico.   A 7.4 magnitude earthquake occurred June 23, 2020 along the southern coastline of Mexico.   MEXICO (CNN) — At least two people have died after a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Mexico’s southern coastline on Tuesday, collapsing buildings and prompting evacuations.  Oaxaca’s state governor Alejandro Murat said a 22-year-old woman and a man were among the dead. The Oaxacan Health Services also reported damages from the quake to general hospitals in Pochutla, Puerto Escondido and Pinotepa Nacional and a few community hospitals in other areas. According to Murat, two of the hospitals with damages have been dealing with coronavirus patients. “We are verifying [damages] because this hospital is also tending Covid cases on the Oaxacan coast,” he said on a radio interview with Radio Fórmula. The severity of the damages are not specified. Mexico’s National Coordination of Civil Protection reported the first death after a structure collapsed after the earthquake, which occurred just east of the popular tourist destination Huatulco. Authorities also reported a power outage throughout the state’s capital and damages to the exterior of a hospital in Oaxaca. The earthquake could be felt as far as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. In capital Mexico City, approximately 190 miles north of the epicenter, tremors were felt and sirens were heard wailing. Tsunami waves of 0.68 meters (2.2 ft) were observed in Acapulco and 0.71 meters (2.3 ft) in Salina Cru. An earlier tsunami warning was revised down, according to the US Tsunami Warning System, forecasting possible waves of up to a meter (3.3 ft). The damage in Oaxaca state is considered light to moderate, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS) ShakeMap. Estimates modeled by the USGS suggest that localized casualties and damage are possible but there are likely to be fewer than 100 fatalities and less than $100 million in damage. However, the model only includes earthquake shaking, and not any impacts from potential tsunamis on the coastline. The USGS said that recent earthquakes in the area have caused secondary hazards such as tsunamis and landslides. Earlier estimates put the magnitude of the earthquake at 7.7, but that has been revised down to 7.4 (and additional revisions are possible). Mexico is one of the world’s most seismically active regions and has a long history of devastating earthquakes. The country is located on top of three large tectonic plates and their movement causes regular quakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. In 2017, two powerful earthquakes hit the country in two weeks, toppling buildings, cracking highways and killing hundreds of people. One had a magnitude of 7.1 and the other a magnitude of 8.1. Mexico City is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes because its very soft and wet ground amplifies shaking and is prone to liquefaction, in which dirt transforms into a dense liquid when sufficiently churned.
