9,"Ten years after an earthquake devastated their country, many Haitians have little hope",2020-01-13 02:36 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/12/world/haiti-earthquake-ten-years-anniversary-intl/index.html," 
      The devastating force of the 7.0 quake on January 12, 2010, split the country’s history into a before, and an after. Before had been a long, tangled history of dictatorship, occupation and resistance, shot through with the pride of a slave revolution that defeated Napoleon Bonaparte’s army. After was unimaginable – a blank slate. 
   
      “I think they just dropped a bomb on Port-au-Prince,” is what Francoise Chandler, a local UNICEF communications officer, told her daughter after the first tremor struck. She had just picked her up from school. 
   
      “Everything was shaking, and there was a lot of noise. I thought it was like September 11 in New York, because I had been in New York in that period,” Chandler says. Thick dust rose in the air around their car. 
   
      “Are we going die?” she remembers her daughter asking. Chandler replied, “I don’t have the answer to that, but if we’re going to die, we’ll die together.”
   
      Her daughter stopped asking questions then, she says.
   
      According to the US Geological Survey, the earthquake itself lasted less than 30 seconds. The immediate aftermath was horrifying. But an outpouring of solidarity within the country, and between Haiti and the rest of the world, gave many Haitians hope.
   
      “The world really did come together around Haiti,” says CNN’s Sanjay Gutpa, who covered the aftermath extensively and even treated injuries while on the ground. “Not every part of the world, but I think if you were to turn on your televisions, if you were to read the newspaper, if you were to talk to your friends, colleagues at work, there was this collective outpouring of support and compassion for Haiti.”
   
      The world sent firemen from New York City, rescue workers from Iceland, hospital tents from Israel, sniffer dogs from China, oil from Venezuela. NGOs that were already in the country leaped into action. Chandler recalls working out of an open-air tent in the days after the quake because the organization’s offices had crumbled. 
   
      International donors pledged millions, which eventually tallied up to more than $10 billion for reconstruction. The earthquake had been particularly lethal due to the fragile construction of Haiti’s buildings, which crashed down upon their inhabitants.
   
      “Right after the earthquake I felt a lot of hope, because I thought emerging from the catastrophe would make everyone a better person in the service of this country,” says Harold Prévil, an obstetrician and head of Sacre Coeur hospital in Haiti’s northern city of Milot.
   
      But a decade later, he and many others tell CNN they are now disillusioned and have far less hope for their country than they did in the gory aftermath of the earthquake.  
   
      “A lot of money was spent after the earthquake, but the results are meager,” Haitian President Jovenel Moise told CNN in an interview Sunday. 
   
      Moise has publicly acknowledged how little Haiti had had moved forward in the past decade. “Despite our best efforts to rebuild after the earthquake, the scars of this tragic event remain,” he said in a statement on Saturday. “Ten years on, we still lack the basic infrastructure and services to support the people of our country.”
   
      Parts of Haiti that were destroyed in 2010 still have not been rebuilt, including the seat of government, the National Palace. And there is little sign that buildings which have been reconstructed are structurally sound enough to keep inhabitants safe through the next earthquake. 
   
      Whiplashed between disasters both natural and political over the past decade, many Haitians have not had a chance to rebuild mentally or emotionally either, says Marline Naromie Joseph, a Haitian psychologist who has worked with Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) for 12 years. She was on the frontlines of emergency medicine in the aftermath of the quake, working with patients who had lost limbs, children who had lost their parents and colleagues who had borne witness to the quake’s horrors. 
   
      Joseph recalls witnessing the first bodies being collected in a city street on the day after the earthquake. 
   
      “The sound that the bodies made falling into the truck was nauseating,” she says. Further along that same road, workers were separating the dead into piles of children and adults, she recalls – an image which would return to her every time she walked on that street for years and which she eventually realized was evidence of her own trauma. 
    
      “Even though there were no longer the children, no longer the dead, it was as if it were the first day that I was seeing them,” she says. “My brain had saved this image and became stuck on it.”
   
      Some patients still have flashbacks to the sensation of the earth moving beneath their feet when revisiting certain settings – like the hospital’s operating room, she says. 
   
      According to Joseph’s diagnosis, the country’s misfortunes over the past decade have piled stress upon trauma. In the years since the earthquake, the country has been pounded with hurricanes, floods and drought. It’s also been betrayed by human error – tied to a devastating cholera epidemic, for example – and government corruption that has sparked Haiti’s current political unrest.
   
      “We can live with stress, but living with permanent stress will not leave the body without consequence. Eventually, you fall directly into exhaustion,” says Joseph, who notes she has observed more mentally ill people living on the streets than before the earthquake.
   
      One particularly bitter frustration on the earthquake’s 10-year anniversary is how weakened the country’s economy and infrastructure seem to be.
   
      “Ten years after, I am a physician, I am the chief executive officer of a 210-bed facility, but believe me, I am hopeless,” says Prévil, the doctor. “Haitians have not had the opportunity to do things differently and better.”
   
      Some things are better. Haiti’s medical system has widened since the quake, and UNICEF reports that no new cholera cases have been diagnosed since February last year. 
   
      But Prévil and Joseph both say that the country’s medical and mental health resources would nevertheless be insufficient for another disaster on the scale of the 2010 earthquake. 
   
      “I would not say we have an institution capable of dealing with all the psychological trauma of another catastrophe like that,” Joseph says.
   
      The country is currently gripped by skyrocketing inflation, while fuel shortages slow the gears of industry and government. According to a new report by the UN’s disaster relief agency OCHA, rising prices mean even basic supplies are now out of reach for the poor. 
    
      In his Saturday statement, Moise rebuked the rest of the world for failing to follow through on its promises. 
   
      “The initial flurry of attention received from the international community quickly quieted down, with many of the financial pledges not delivered – causing devastating consequences for our recovery,” he said. 
   
      “Little of the aid that was received ended up in Haitian hands and much of the money that was so generously given was not spent on the right projects and places,” Moise added, echoing a common criticism that aid money focused on short-term relief rather than sustainable, long-term systems.
   
      By 2012, $6.4 billion of the more than $10 billion pledged had been disbursed, according to a report by Paul Farmer, a Harvard medical anthropologist who served as the UN’s Deputy Special Envoy for Haiti. 
   
      And while there is little consensus over how much more of the money has been spent, the report on the first two years of spending supports Moise’s point. It noted that “less than 10 percent was disbursed directly to the [Government of Haiti]  using its systems; less than 0.6 percent was disbursed directly to Haitian organizations and businesses as program grants.”
   
      What Haiti’s government has done with the funds it had at its disposal is also a cause for complaint for many citizens. 
   
      For nearly two years now, Haiti has been in political crisis – sometimes punctuated with country-wide lockdowns – over dissatisfaction with the government and how it has dealt with allegations of extraordinary corruption.
   
      The protests were sparked by a fuel price hike and an official report alleging that past administrations had wasted millions of dollars intended for critical infrastructure projects, paying through the nose for contracts on new roads and buildings that went entirely unbuilt, in some cases. That money, stemming from a pre-earthquake deal with Venezuela known as PetroCaribe, will eventually have to be repaid by Haiti’s next generation.
   
      “What frustrated me a lot and made me feel really sad and sick was that I thought that the Haitian people and the Haitians who were in charge of the country would have taken [the earthquake] as an opportunity to make the country better,” says Prévil. 
   
      “But it has not happened. My leaders have become more selfish, they have been robbing more. So instead of taking the opportunity to change the country, they’ve made it worse.”
   
      Haiti has never come out of the darkness of the 2010 earthquake, says Etzer Emile, a Haitian economics researcher and entrepreneur in Port-au-Prince who identifies himself as one of the activists calling for change. He credits the PetroCaribe scandal with drawing local corruption into focus and creating a movement for change, disruptive as it is. 
   
      “You know, that can make us feel (like) … there’s something actually we had, and we didn’t really take advantage of it.”
   
      Now that the government has publicly documented funds lost or disappeared, Emile says the numbers are accessible in a way that they weren’t before. They also can be shared easily thanks to social media, which has fanned outrage and calls for change – including for Moise’s resignation – as anti-corruption activists accuse the President of turning a blind eye to the PetroCaribe allegations.
   
      Moise told CNN that fighting corruption is still a priority of his administration and said that the past months of political unrest have exacerbated Haiti’s economic problems. 
   
      “We need the same solidarity we had after the earthquake,” he said, emphasizing this time he means solidarity with “the actors who are putting the country on a path to change, to economic growth, and development.”
   
      Haiti is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and its location in the Caribbean lies squarely in the middle of a hurricane belt. As it looks toward the future, how Haiti can prepare for the next great disaster – and what kind of help it might receive – are urgent questions.
   
      Emile believes Haiti no longer commands the same interest and compassion that it did in 2010. 
   
      “If Haiti’s reconstruction had been a success, maybe we could have been interesting to people as a case study. But it was a failure, so people feel fed up … they don’t even want to talk about it that much,” he says. “The further we go from the earthquake, the less interested people are in Haiti.”
   
      The drop in interest is, in fact, measurable: A 2019 UN plan for humanitarian aid to Haiti only managed to raise a third of the funding it needed.
   
      Vania André, publisher of the Haitian Times, a paper of record for the Haitian diaspora, says that the earthquake galvanized the loyalty – and a certain defiance – of generations of Haitian Americans. 
   
      It became common to hear stories of Haitian-Americans “leaving their corporate jobs in DC or Florida and moving to Haiti to create a nonprofit,” she says. “They wanted people to see that Haiti is much more than the devastation that happened with the earthquake, that Haiti is much more than this republic of NGOs.” 
   
      But she also notes that many of those same foreign-born idealists did not stay long, discouraged by the skepticism they encountered and the difficulties of doing business.
   
As the flow of foreign aid money ebbs and Haitians lose faith in their government, some say they only thing they can rely on is their own experience. 
   
      Prévil, the obstetrician, says another earthquake would be Haiti’s “worst nightmare” and that he still gets flashbacks to the feeling of the ground moving under his feet. But at least he now knows how to react. 
   
      “If there is another earthquake, I have a good strong desk. I will go under the desk,” he says. “And then I will call for my contingency plan and start right away to take care of as many people as I can. Because I know what to do now.”

The weather service said there is a threat of tsunami waves reaching about 1 to 3 feet above tide level for the coasts of Jamaica, Belize, Cuba, Honduras, Mexico and the Cayman Islands. The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake had a preliminary depth of 6 miles. There are no initial reports of damage or casualties. The earthquake has prompted some evacuations in Miami. Police say the quake shook up some high rises in the downtown and financial districts. Officials say some of those buildings were evacuated, including eight that residents emptied on their own. The city’s government center is closed as a precaution. Carol Rosenberg, a New York Times reporter, tweeted that the “earth is literally shaking here” at the press room at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. The USGS initially estimated the earthquake was a 7.3 magnitude, before upgrading it to 7.7.  — NWS San Juan (@NWSSanJuan) January 28, 2020  Now, on a 40-second delay we hear that it rattled the courtroom too.

111,Tsunami threat message issued after magnitude 7.7 earthquake off the coast of Jamaica,2020-01-28 19:40 UTC,https://fox61.com/2020/01/28/tsunami-threat-message-issued-after-magnitude-7-7-earthquake-off-the-coast-of-jamaica/,"A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Tuesday about 80 miles from Jamaica, shaking people in the Caribbean and as far away as Miami. A tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica, or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. A tsunami threat alert was lifted Tuesday afternoon, a few hours after the quake. Alec Pultr, who lives in Ogier, Grand Cayman, said it wasn’t the first earthquake he’s experienced but it was the biggest “by far.” “We were simply working and things started to sway,” he told CNN. As the swaying and shaking became more violent, most people started to run; the ones who stayed behind got under their desks. People in Miami, 440 miles from the epicenter, felt shaking. Miguel Charon was on the 13th floor of a building on Brickell Avenue. He told CNN he felt the walls shake for 30 to 40 seconds. His initial thought was that it must have been caused by a machine of some sort. He said building officials issued an evacuation order and people left the building in a smooth and calm manner. Jose Borrego, who also works in the Brickell area, said he was in a meeting. “We felt slight movement of the building, then we got told to evacuate the building,” he said. “Once we came outside (we) noticed that there are evacuations every building in the area.” The earthquake appears to have been a “strike-slip earthquake,” in which tectonic plates slide against each other. This limits the threat of a devastating tsunami, which are more associated with “thrust earthquakes,” where a portion of the earth is thrust upward and causes the water to push up and outward, creating the tsunami. The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake had a preliminary depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). The quake hit 125 kilometers (77.6 miles) north-northwest of Lucea in Jamaica. The earthquake also was felt as far away as Havana. Some people in the Cuban capital were evacuating taller buildings. Cuba’s state media reported the earthquake was felt across the island in Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, Holguín, Las Tunas, Cienfuegos, Pinar del Río, Havana and the Isle of Youth. There are no initial reports of damage or casualties.   Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     In Other News Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings.","A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Tuesday about 80 miles from Jamaica, shaking people in the Caribbean and as far away as Miami.

115,Some Bay Area hospital buildings pose risk of earthquake collapse,2020-01-24 03:50 UTC,https://abc7news.com/some-bay-area-hospital-buildings-pose-risk-of-earthquake-collapse/5874314/,"WATCH LIVE An I-Team analysis of data from California's Office of Statewide Health, Planning and Development found 41 Bay Area hospital buildings that pose a significant risk of collapse and danger to the public in the event of an earthquake. SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Scientists say it is not a matter of if, but when a major earthquake strikes our region. When the big one hits, people will rely on hospitals to take care of the thousands who are expected to be injured but will they still be standing? The I-Team's Melanie Woodrow has been digging into state data. The Seismic Safety Act originally gave hospitals until 2008 to make their buildings safe in a major quake. Many hospitals applied for an extension until January 1st, 2020 and have now applied and been granted new extensions, even though they have a number of buildings that pose a risk of collapse. An I-TEAM analysis of data from California's Office of Statewide Health, Planning and Development found 41 Bay Area hospital buildings that pose a significant risk of collapse and danger to the public in the event of an earthquake.  For the last 12 years, more than 200 hospital facilities across the state have been working to upgrade their buildings to make them more structurally sound in the event of an earthquake. Santa Clara Valley Medical Center is one of several hospitals that applied for and was granted an extension beyond an already existing January 1, 2020 extension. According to the state, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center has five buildings that pose a significant risk of collapse and danger to the public in the event of an earthquake. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson tells the I-Team, the state granted an extension for three of the buildings until July 1, 2022. ""There are no acute care beds in these structures. Santa Clara Valley Medical Center has a permit in place and will begin to seismically retrofit these structures prior to the new deadline,"" wrote the spokesperson.  The statement also says the two other buildings have also been granted an extension to January 1, 2025. ""These structures include 16 patient beds and medical records, which will be moved to compliant buildings in 2021."" The other two hospitals with the most buildings that pose a significant risk of collapse are California Pacific Medical Center West Campus with seven buildings and Stanford Health Care with six buildings. CPMC tells the I-Team the hospital at the West Campus is now closed and all inpatient services have been transferred to the Van Ness Campus. Also that, ""There are some isolated support and outpatient care services still operating in the facility, which will relocate throughout 2020."" Stanford Health Care says there are no hospital beds or acute care in their six significant risk buildings. ""The affected outpatient services will be moved to a new space in Redwood City or on the main Palo Alto Campus by the end of 2023,"" writes a spokesperson.

This is how the Church of Guayanilla was after the earthquake. #TemblorPR#EarthquakePRpic.twitter.com/fuoUQZtAhL  Over the past several weeks, hundreds of small earthquakes have occurred in the region, the USGS said. The seismic activity began with a magnitude 4.7 earthquake late on Dec. 28 and was followed by a magnitude 5.0 tremor just a few hours later. Since Dec. 28, the USGS said more than 400 magnitude 2+ earthquakes have occurred in the region. Some 10 of them registered stronger than magnitude 4, including Tuesday’s tremor. About 25 volunteers from the First Congregational Church of Hartland arrived in Puerto Rico on Sunday to help with relief efforts from the devastation of Hurricane Maria which left thousands dead in September 2017. All of them were reported safe and they had planned to continue working to renovate a church in San Juan but officials concerned about more earthquakes and whether the building remains structurally safe has paused all their efforts for now. “At this point, we are unclear about how the remainder of our week and work plans will unfold,” D’Anna said.  Seventh-day Adventist leaders in Puerto Rico are also struggling to understand the series of earthquakes that have been plaguing the island and the uncertainty that hangs over the lives of many affected by the disaster. “We have never as a country dealt with such earthquake in all my years,” Pastor Jose A. Rodríguez, president of the church in Puerto Rico, said in a field report from the SDA.  “There is so much uncertainty now, bridges are down, roads have collapsed, power hasn’t been restored and many are taking refuge in parks and arenas,” he said. He explained that at least six members of his church have lost their homes as a result of the earthquake and leaders in the South Puerto Rico Conference are still assessing the needs of members.

The local Latin American community joined with other groups, churches and synagogues to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, she said. “So many infrastructure problems still remain from past disasters,” she said. “The electric grid is still very fragile. A lot of things have been normalized; it’s not unusual to lose power or water. People are more nonchalant about it. That becomes oppressive day after day. It’s very sad.”  Was this article helpful?

PONCE, Puerto Rico — A 6.4 magnitude earthquake and several other strong temblors struck Puerto Rico Tuesday morning, killing at least one man and injuring several others one day after a 5.8 magnitude quake shook the island, officials said. Power outages and damage have been reported near the island’s southern coast, including in the city of Ponce, where a 77-year-old man was killed and at least eight others were injured, Ponce emergency management director Angel Vasquez said Tuesday morning.   Riko Gonzalez and his parents were sleeping in their home in Yauco, near Indios, when the 6.4 quake struck. They awoke to a rumble and scurried out of the house. China and glasses were smashed on the kitchen floor, he said. It was “horrible, nothing compared to the (magnitude) 5s from yesterday,” Gonzalez told CNN. “People are afraid to go to bed, to then be woken up to worse earthquakes than the day before,” he said. In Guayanilla, just north of Indios, homes and a church were damaged, Mayor Nelson Torres said in a phone interview with CNN affiliate WAPA. Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority reported widespread outages across the island after its power plants activated an auto protective mechanism following the earthquake. Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced urged citizens to remain calm as the government responds to the most recent quake in a statement posted on Twitter. “I hope all are well. We are getting our information from @NMEADpr and @DSPnoticias,” the tweet said. “The entire government is active and in action. I ask our people to remain calm and urge you to remain safe.” The earthquakes come more than two years after Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory in September 2017. No tsunami is expected following Tuesday’s earthquakes, the US National Tsunami Warning Center said. The magnitude of Tuesday morning’s largest quake was adjusted slightly downward in the hours after it struck, after initially being recorded as a 6.6. Puerto Rico has experienced a flurry of earthquakes since December 28, according to data from the USGS, ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to Sunday’s 5.8. All the earthquakes appear to have been foreshocks to Tuesday morning’s largest quake, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. On Monday, the early morning quake in the same area caused some damage, including rock slides and a home collapse in Guayanilla, said Carlos Acevedo, Puerto Rico’s Emergency Management Agency director. This is a developing story and will be updated.

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Local utilities are looking for new ways to make Southern California earthquake safe, and one way is by replacing aging water pipes. The new pipes could help keep the water flowing after a big one hits. LADWP is replacing critical areas along its 7,000 miles of water pipes in Los Angeles with earthquake resilient pipes to ensure water is still flowing after the shaking stops. ""We live in earthquake country. The Northridge earthquake is another reminder for us to make sure that we develop an infrastructure that is resilient where we can bounce back and provide reliable water supplies to our customers after a large earthquake event,"" said Alvin Bautista of LADWP. RELATED | How to make your own earthquake kit  LADWP joined Japan's earthquake resilient pipe network in 2013, making L.A. the United States' first public utility system to use the earthquake resilient pipe. It involves a stronger steel pipe coating and a joint that doesn't crack during shaking. ""Our regular pipe does not have this type of freedom of movement, so the material that we use has it, so it will allow for a certain amount of expansion and contraction, it also gives it a degree of freedom where it can rotate along the axis there so that it doesn't break with excessive movement underground,"" said Bautista. LADWP's long-term replacement plan will take years to complete; targeted locations in critical earthquake hazard zones were first to receive the earthquake resilient pipe. ""Areas where we need reliable water supply such as hospitals, command and control centers, shelters, areas where people will gather after a large earthquake event, those areas need to be reliable with the water supply, that's our focus,"" said Bautista. Drivers around L.A. will notice construction zones where crews are installing the earthquake resilient pipe. After the replacement is done and the traffic inconvenience is over, L.A. will have the sturdiest water pipes in America.

A typical retrofit in the Bay Area can cost from $5,000 to $7,500. $13.2 million is available this year from a FEMA grant. It's estimated that there are 1.2 million vulnerable homes in California. Retrofit work has to be done by a contractor certified for the program by the state within six months of approval.  Hartung's contractor, Christopher Scola of Construction CMS in San Jose, showed us a typical half-inch bolt that was used in the 50s or 60s with a tiny washer and a little nut to secure a house to the foundation. Scola said today the code requires ""a much bigger bolt, 5/8 inch thick with a much bigger washer, and the spacing is now three to four feet apart whereas in the 60s they would be six feet apart, if that."" The work typically takes a couple of days. The goal is to retrofit 4,400 homes this year. Since the first grants were awarded in 2014, about 10,000 California homes have been retrofitted under the program. ""I have the cripple wall, which is the area between the foundation and the floor that we had to add plywood to that, and most homes don't have cripple walls,"" Hartung said. ""So that was just one day doing all the plywood. And then the next day then they did all the brackets.""  Word of mouth is a big part of this program. While we were at Hartung's Almaden Valley home, one of his neighbors called to find out why a camera crew was there. He told them about the program, and now that neighbor is interested in applying for the Earthquake Brace+Bolt program. To find out if you live in one of the 355 high-hazard ZIP codes eligible to apply, you can go to their website. There is also a database of FEMA-trained licensed contractors certified for the program, searchable by zip code.  See more stories and videos about Building a Better Bay Area here.

The earthquake was centered about 7.5 miles southeast of Kīlauea caldera near the Hōlei Pali area of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park at a depth of 4.8 miles. A map showing its location is posted on the HVO website. More details are available at the National Earthquake Information Center website. Weak to light shaking, with maximum Intensity of III, has been reported across the Island of Hawai‘i.  At that intensity, significant damage to buildings or structures is not expected. The USGS “Did you feel it?” service received over 280 felt reports within the first hour of the earthquake. According to HVO seismologist Brian Shiro, the earthquake had no apparent effect on Kīlauea or Mauna Loa volcanoes.  “We see no detectable changes in activity at the summits or along the rift zones of Kīlauea or Mauna Loa as a result of this earthquake,” Shiro said. “Aftershocks are possible and could be felt.”  HVO continues to monitor Kīlauea and other Hawaiian volcanoes for any changes. Most earthquakes Kīlauea’s south flank are caused by abrupt motion of the flank itself, which moves to the southeast over the oceanic crust. The location, depth and waveforms recorded as part of Sunday’s earthquake are consistent with slip along this south flank fault. This earthquake is likely an aftershock of the 2018 magnitude-6.9 earthquake as the volcano continues to settle. According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there was no tsunami threat from this earthquake.

          The fault line, called a strike-slip fault, is where two segments of the earth crust slide past each other. Along this fault, as tension builds, earthquakes occur to release the strain. Because the North American plate and the Caribbean plate are sliding and not impinging on each other, it's uncommon for earthquakes in these areas to produce tsunamis, except in the case of underwater landslides. Tuesday's 7.7 earthquake was followed by a magnitude 6.5 earthquake hours later near Grand Cayman. Two years ago a magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred west of the Caymans along a separate segment of the fault. This earthquake activity is not related to the recent quakes in Puerto Rico. The seismic energy of the quake was felt as far away as Cancun, Mexico and Nassau in the Bahamas. The shaking was also felt in Tampa and Orlando, but was most pronounced in Miami-Dade and Broward, especially in taller buildings that swayed, as the earth below gently shook. More aftershocks are likely in the Caribbean in the coming days.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Along this fault, as tension builds, earthquakes occur to release the strain.

Please enter a search term.       HAVANA (AP) — A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday. Witnesses reported strong shaking but there was no immediate word of casualties or heavy damage.  The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. “It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,” she told The Associated Press. Several South Florida buildings were being evacuated as a precation, according to city of Miami and Miami-Dade County officials. No injuries or road closures have been reported. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands see so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. “‘It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,”‘ Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.” Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she had seen manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage. Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway. “It felt to me like i was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,” he said. He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize. The USGS initially reported the magnitude at 7.3.

Video from Turkey’s IHA Broadcasting Services shows emergency crews rescuing injured people from a collapsed building. The earthquake caused five buildings to collapse in Elazig and heavy damage to a number of buildings in the area, Minister of Environment and Urbanization Murat Kurum told reporters. Preliminary reports say the earthquake lasted 40 seconds, AFAD said, adding that 3,699 search and rescue personnel have been deployed. Fifteen aftershocks have been felt in the wake, with the strongest registering at 5.4 magnitude, Soylu said. The quake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 10 km (6 miles), according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which enhances the shaking felt at the surface. About 500,000 people felt strong to very strong shaking, the USGS reported. The earthquake was felt in several other countries, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. The quake interrupted a live broadcast of Edessa TV. Video of the broadcast shows four anchors talking while everything shakes around them. All relevant departments were taking measures to ensure the safety of citizens following the earthquake, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said early Saturday. Interior, health and environment ministers were sent to the quake-hit area.

 A small earthquake was reported in southern Kansas on Sunday. The U.S. Geological Survey said a magnitude 4.4 earthquake struck about 2 miles (3 kilometers) southwest of Hutchinson shortly after 1 p.m. No damage was immediately reported. The earthquake happened near where several others have happened before in Reno County, The Hutchinson News reported. Kansas began seeing a spike in earthquakes in 2014 that were blamed on wastewater injection wells from oil and gas production. The number of quakes began tampering off after oil prices dropped and regulations were enacted.

An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.0 rattled Puerto Rico on Saturday morning, the U.S. Geological Survey reports. The quake was about 8 miles south of Indios, Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean Sea, the USGS said, at a depth of 6.2 miles. Puerto Rico has been rattled by temblors throughout the week, including a 6.4 magnitude quake Tuesday that killed at least one man, destroyed homes and left most of the island without power. A 5.2 magnitude aftershock struck on Friday afternoon. The U.S. territory was expecting power to return by Saturday to its 3 million residents, and authorities had tweeted that it was 95% restored a couple of hours before Saturday's quake. Parts of Lares, Adjuntas, Ponce and San German lost electrical service after Saturday's quake, the power company Electric Energy Authority said. After the tremor, power was on to about 93% of the island, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority said. Since Dec. 28, about 500 earthquakes of magnitude 2.0 or higher have hit Puerto Rico, the USGS said. On Friday,  a CNN crew said its truck moved during the aftershock, one of the strongest since Tuesday's 6.4 magnitude quake. The aftershock came as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, is making aid available and assisting with damage assessment.  Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced has declared a state of emergency, activated the Puerto Rico National Guard and urged residents to stay calm, but prepared, for aftershocks.  For many, that has meant bringing mattresses, tents and tarps into their yards to sleep, for fear of what aftershocks could do to their already damaged homes. Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico's non-voting delegate to Congress, spoke at a news conference Friday with Vázquez and Florida Sen. Rick Scott after touring the damaged Costa Sur Power Plant. She said more than 6,000 people were staying in shelters. Vázquez said she had spoken with President Donald Trump to thank him for his support and to urge his prompt approval of a major disaster declaration. Myrna Delgado said she sought refuge outside her home when the first temblors started Dec. 28. She slept in a van and then at a stadium shelter in the southwestern city of Yauco. ""I'm very nervous,"" she told CNN on Friday. ""At night I feel very depressed. We don't have light at home. With the company of other people, at least we feel safe."" Noelia de Jesus and her granddaughters are also among those in a shelter. They are also among the many who are looking for a place to stay for the third time, having lost their homes when Hurricane George struck in 1998 and again during Hurricane Maria. Luis Garcia, a resident of the southern coastal city of Guayanilla, said he was finding it harder to secure basics such as gas and food than after Hurricane Maria in 2017.  As Puerto Rico waits to see what may follow, officials are aiming to restore power by the end of the weekend. Power has been restored to about 80% of Puerto Rico's 1.4 million utility customers across the island, Puerto Rico Electric Energy Authority said via Twitter on Friday, but the goal is for everyone to have power on Saturday. Three of the territory's major power plants are expected to be in service again by Saturday, with a fourth aimed at operating on Sunday, power utility CEO Jose Ortiz said.  Officials are also working to reopen schools, which have canceled classes until crews can inspect buildings and ensure their safety for students. ""Classes in the public school system won't resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,"" Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won't return to the schools until further notice.

According to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which serves about 1.5 million customers, service was restored to about half a million customers. Puerto Rico Gov.

The Authority of Electrical Energy, the power company for Puerto Rico, said that power plants have activated an auto protective mechanism and are out of service following the earthquake. On Twitter, Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced told citizens to remain calm as the government responds to the most recent quake. “I hope all are well. We are getting our information from @NMEADpr and @DSPnoticias,” the tweet said. “The entire government is active and in action. I ask our people to remain calm and urge you to remain safe.” No tsunami is expected following the earthquake, the US National Tsunami Warning Center said. There were no immediate reports of damage following Tuesday’s quake. Geologists warned that more earthquakes, known as aftershocks and tremors, would follow Monday’s quake. “When there are more earthquakes, the chance of a large earthquake is greater which means that the chance of damage is greater,” the USGS said. On Monday, the early morning quake in the same area caused some damage, including a home collapse in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, Director of Emergency Management Carlos Acevedo said.

It was centered about 8 miles south-southeast of Indios, Puerto Rico, and struck at a depth of about 3.7 miles below ground. At least two houses collapsed in the southwestern coastal town of Guanica, Director of Emergency Management Carlos Acevedo told CNN affiliate WAPA-TV. Acevedo said one of the homes was abandoned. Some victims of the earthquake posted photos of deep cracks in walls. No tsunami warning was issued after the quake.

(Dakota News Now) - Residents in Edmunds and Walworth counties are still trying to make sense of the rumbling and shaking they felt Tuesday night after an earthquake struck just north of Bowdle. Just before heading to bed last night, Bowdle Mayor Rick Boschee heard something strange, almost like a storm had suddenly moved in over the area. “I heard a loud bang, and I thought it could’ve been lighting and thunder, you know. We did set a record high yesterday, so it wouldn’t surprise me,” Boschee said. But what he really heard was an earthquake. The United States Geological Survey detected a small earthquake just before midnight seven miles north of Bowdle, registering at a 3.2 on the Richter scale, just above the threshold where quakes can be felt. And the shaking was much more intense closer to the epicenter. “My daughter, son-in-law, her family, they live out there. And she told me they could really feel it there. Of course, they’re only about three miles from where it actually took place,” Boschee said. Boschee said the earthquake was the talk of the town Wednesday, with most only hearing a rumbling sound but some experiencing some shaking. “I know there’s been a little talk this morning in town. People that have heard it or felt it didn’t know what it was. Yeah, it’s quite interesting.” It’s the second earthquake to hit the state this year. The other struck near Platte earlier this year but was too weak to be felt. Earthquakes are rare in South Dakota, but they’re not unheard of. The last earthquake to hit the state that could be felt struck near Onida in 2017. Boschee said the one that struck Tuesday night is just another item on the list of strange and crazy things to happen this year. “It’s 2020. So with the pandemic and politics, why should we be surprised by an earthquake really?” Since 1900, the USGS has recorded 67 earthquakes that either struck South Dakota or hit close enough to be felt within the state. Most were located along the Missouri River and James River valleys, or in the Black Hills Region. The earthquake that hit Bowdle Tuesday night was the largest since 2018, when a 3.2 magnitude was recorded north of Valentine, Nebraska. Copyright 2020 Dakota News Now.

 A 5.7 magnitude earthquake near the Turkish-Iranian border early Sunday killed nine people in Turkey and injured at least 65 in Iran. The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake was centered in the town of Habash-e Olya, in Iran's West Azerbaijan province, about 10 kilometers from the Turkish border. But the quake was primarily felt in Turkey's Van province, where nine people, including four children, were killed and 37 injured. Residents of villages affected helped Turkish troops dig through the rubble of collapsed houses and schools looking for survivors Iran is reporting at least 65 injuries and damaged buildings. A number of aftershocks were felt Sunday, the strongest measuring 6.0. Turkey and Iran are no strangers to strong earthquakes, some of which have caused horrific death tolls. A 2011 quake in Van province killed more than 600 people. A 2017 quake that shook Iran's Kermanshah province left 620 dead. Iran's deadliest quake, a 7.4 in June 1990, killed 40,000 people in northern Iran.

In 1812 a major 7.5 earthquake destroyed the town of New Madrid in the Bootheel of Missouri. Effects from the quake were felt in St. Louis, and tremors rang the bells in Philadelphia.  The seismic waves also developed a few smaller fault lines here in the Ozarks. Most of these faults are inactive, or only have small tremors.  The fault line in New Madrid on average goes off every six hundred years. While the risk is low for a major earthquake to occur, smaller tremors are felt thousands of times a year. If another major earthquake were to shake Missouri, the effects of it would even be felt here in Springfield. Matt Forir, the Greene County Geologist, said distance would not necessarily weaken the seismic waves. Because the earth’s crust and rock is thicker under Missouri, the energy from the epicenter would travel.  “We’re going to feel it here, and it’s not going to be diminished much from the epicenter. If we have that eight point or larger, there’s going to be damage,” Forir said.  With the population of Missouri and Arkansas having increased in the last 200 years, the effects would be more devastating.  When it comes to Springfield, Greene County Emergency Management is most prepared for a large influx of people evacuating the Bootheel.  “As far as evacuations go, you’re looking at people evacuating west.” Russell said.  Springfield will likely become a hub for recovery efforts, as it is centrally located. Greene County Emergency management has taken special training to prepare for this type of event, and for disasters similar.  While the likelihood of a major earthquake happening is slim, earthquakes are not predictable, so preparedness is key.   “What are you going to do if you’re in a house? We’ll you’re going to find an archway, a doorway to get into, you’re going to find some place that’s stable above you.” Forir said.  If you are outside, Forir recommends sitting down and just pay attention to what is above you.

A tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica, or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. A tsunami threat alert was lifted Tuesday afternoon, a few hours after the quake. Alec Pultr, who lives in Ogier, Grand Cayman, said it wasn't the first earthquake he's experienced but it was the biggest ""by far."" ""We were simply working and things started to sway,"" he told CNN. As the swaying and shaking became more violent, most people started to run; the ones who stayed behind got under their desks. People in Miami, 440 miles from the epicenter, felt shaking. Miguel Charon was on the 13th floor of a building on Brickell Avenue. He told CNN he felt the walls shake for 30 to 40 seconds. His initial thought was that it must have been caused by a machine of some sort. He said building officials issued an evacuation order and people left the building in a smooth and calm manner. Jose Borrego, who also works in the Brickell area, said he was in a meeting. ""We felt slight movement of the building, then we got told to evacuate the building,"" he said. ""Once we came outside (we) noticed that there are evacuations every building in the area."" The earthquake appears to have been a ""strike-slip earthquake,"" in which tectonic plates slide against each other. This limits the threat of a devastating tsunami, which are more associated with ""thrust earthquakes,"" where a portion of the earth is thrust upward and causes the water to push up and outward, creating the tsunami. The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake had a preliminary depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). The quake hit 125 kilometers (77.6 miles) north-northwest of Lucea in Jamaica. The earthquake also was felt as far away as Havana. Some people in the Cuban capital were evacuating taller buildings. Cuba's state media reported the earthquake was felt across the island in Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, Holguín, Las Tunas, Cienfuegos, Pinar del Río, Havana and the Isle of Youth.

A tsunami warning was not issued for any region, and the National Weather Service’s initial warning of waves up to 3 feet above tide level possible for Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Belize, Honduras and the Cayman Islands has expired. Miami City Commissioner Ken Russell says those in eight buildings in the Brickell and downtown areas self-evacuated and the building department was onsite. The Stephen P. Clark Government Center has been closed as a precaution. All Miami-Dade County courthouses have been evacuated and are expected to resume normal operations Wednesday. City of Miami Fire Rescue, with the help of engineers, deployed a drone in the Brickell area to search for cracks in concrete or any broken windows.  Russell deployed crews to survey more than a dozen affected buildings throughout the city. The Miami-Dade Emergency Operations Center was already activated due to the Super Bowl, but is now adding additional agencies to deal with the earthquake and infrastructure in South Florida. Video from a Local 10 News viewer in Aventura showed the window shaking from side to side as the quake was felt in their home on the 30th floor of the Mystic Pointe apartments. Roy Stein, who lives on the 32nd floor of 1060 Brickell, said he saw all the commotion from his balcony and went outside to find out what was happening. “I spoke to somebody. He said the building moved,” Stein said. “I go, ‘What do you mean the building moved?’ And then after I spoke to a few other people and went online, I read about an earthquake in Cuba and that’s when I put two and two together and figured we had an earthquake, or it was at least felt here in Miami.” Stein said he lived in California for 33 years and isn’t concerned about going back inside his building, but he spoke to some inside the nearby Bank of America building who said they saw doors slam shut. “I think the 49ers have done this to get the home-field advantage in the Super Bowl,” he said, alluding to the upcoming Super Bowl in South Florida between San Francisco and the Kansas City Chiefs. Hundreds of workers could be seen standing outside the Datran Center in the Dadeland area after evacuating the building, with police officers blocked traffic outside the buildings. Tenants at the Miami Tower in downtown spoke with the city of Miami hotline to report the building’s movement, but did not evacuate.

No damage has yet been reported in the country. The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands see so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. ""'It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,""' Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.” Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she had seen manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage.

Come on guys show what we can do together! @Cavs @chicagobulls @Kizilay — Cedi Osman (@cediosman) January 25, 2020 24-year-old Osman is of Turkish descent and a member of the Turkish national basketball team. The Cavs host the Chicago Bulls at 8 p.m. The death toll from a strong earthquake that rocked eastern Turkey climbed to 22 on Saturday as rescue crews searched for people who remained trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, officials said. Speaking at a televised news conference near the epicenter of the quake in Elazig province, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said 18 people were killed in Elazig and four in neighboring Malatya. Some 1,103 people were injured, with 34 of them in intensive care but not in critical condition, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the funeral of a mother and son killed in the quake while visiting the hardest-hit areas. He warned people against repeating “negative” hearsay about the country being unprepared for earthquakes. “Do not listen to rumors, do not listen to anyone’s negative, contrary propaganda, and know that we are your servants,” Erdogan said.  It was followed by 398 aftershocks, the strongest of them with magnitudes 5.4 and 5.1, the disaster agency said. Emergency workers and security forces distributed tents, beds and blankets as overnight temperatures dropped below freezing in the affected areas. Mosques, schools, sports halls and student dormitories were opened for hundreds who left their homes after the quake. “The earthquake was very severe. We desperately ran out (of our home),” Emre Gocer told the state-run Anadolu news agency as he sheltered with his family at a sports hall in Sivrice. “We don’t have a safe place to stay right now.” Erdogan on Saturday afternoon visited Sirvice and the city of Elazig, the provincial capital located some 565 kilometers (350 miles) east of Ankara. The Turkish leader promised state support for those affected by the disaster. “We will not leave anyone in the open,” he said. Earlier, a prosecutor in the capital Ankara announced an investigation into “provocative” social media posts. The Anadolu news agency reported that Turkey’s broadcasting authority was also reviewing media coverage of the quake. At least five buildings in Sivrice and 25 in Malatya province were destroyed in the disaster, Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said. Hundreds of other structures were damaged and made unsafe. AFAD reported that 42 people had been rescued as search teams combed wrecked apartment buildings. Television footage showed emergency workers removing a woman from the wreckage of a collapsed building 19 hours after the main earthquake struck. A prison in Adiyaman, 110 kilometers (70 miles) southwest of the epicenter, was evacuated due to damage its more than 800 prisoners transferred to nearby jails. AFAD said 28 rescue teams had been working around the clock. More than 2,600 personnel from 39 of Turkey’s 81 provinces were sent to the disaster site. Unmanned drones were used to survey damaged neighborhoods and coordinate rescue efforts. “Our biggest hope is that the death toll does not rise,” Parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop said. Communication companies announced free telephone and internet services for residents in the quake-hit region. Neighboring Greece, which is at odds with Turkey over maritime boundaries and gas exploration rights, offered to send rescue crews to assist the Turkish teams. Erdogan appeared to reject the offer of outside assistance during his visit to the city of Elazig, telling reporters, “Our state does not need anything.” Turkey sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent. Two strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey in 1999, killing around 18,000 people. A magnitude 6 earthquake killed 51 people in Elazig in 2010.

Neighboring Greece, which is at odds with Turkey over maritime boundaries and gas exploration rights, offered to send rescue crews to assist the Turkish teams.
Erdogan appeared to reject the offer of outside assistance during his visit to the city of Elazig, telling reporters, “Our state does not need anything.” Turkey sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent.

The 6.7-magnitude quake struck near the town of Sivrice, in eastern Elazig province, collapsing at least 10 buildings, Turkish Interior Minister Sulyman Soylu said. Two of the injured are in critical condition, according to the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD. Preliminary reports say the earthquake lasted 40 seconds, AFAD said. Fifteen aftershocks have been felt in the wake, with the strongest registering at 5.4 magnitude, Soylu said. The quake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 10 km (6 miles), according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which enhances the shaking felt at the surface. About 500,000 people felt strong to very strong shaking, the USGS reported. The earthquake was felt in several other countries, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. According to the initial estimates from USGS, damage should be “relatively localized.” The quake interrupted a live broadcast of Edessa TV. Video of the broadcast shows four anchors talking while everything shakes around them. This is a developing story.

         PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- Another powerful earthquake rocked Puerto Rico, leaving at least one person dead and the island in a state of emergency. A young Roxborough native who is in Puerto Rico visiting, was among those jarred by the pre-dawn earthquake.  The 21-year-old was one of many tourists and residents jolted out of their sleep after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit the island of Puerto Rico just before dawn. ""Everything was shaking, I felt like my body was shaking, we were shaking,"" Adams said. ""I thought the house was going to fall down."" Adams is in Salinas, Puerto Rico, staying close to the beach. The Roxborough native, along with her boyfriend and his mother, Maria Setzler, scurried to a safe zone after a tsunami warning was issued. Setzler moved back to the island three months ago. ""The earthquakes, they do come pretty often. We do get them frequent, not as strong as this one this morning,"" she said. ""Since September, I've been through four earthquakes but this is the first one that I've actually felt."" ""We got up and moved out of town really quick because we're like five minutes away from water,"" Adams added. While the Salinas area was spared any significant damage, the town of Guayanilla did not escape the destruction caused by the earthquake. Many residents found themselves trapped in their homes. Some homes were reduced to rubble, crushing cars underneath. ""My power in my room here in Old San Juan is out,"" one person said. The power company cut power to the entire island just as a precaution. It's the second earthquake in as many days with a 5.8 magnitude quake hitting the day before. The United States Geological Survey says Puerto Rico's seismic activity is occurring along three faults on the island's southwest region. Adams is riding out the power outage on the beach. ""I did want to go home right away when it happened, but now I feel a lot calmer and at ease, so now I want to stay and enjoy the rest of it,"" Adams said. Nerves are still frayed as many on the island are still trying to pick up the pieces of their lives. For those traveling, American Airlines says there are no impacts to scheduled operations within their networks at San Juan's airport. Nonetheless, the airline is in the process of issuing a travel notice allowing customers to alter travel plans, without incurring any charge fees.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

HAVANA — A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday, shaking a vast area from Mexico to Florida and beyond, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or heavy damage.  The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. “It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,” she told The Associated Press. It was also felt a little further east at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the southeastern coast of the island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages, said J. Overton, a spokesman for the installation, which has a total population of about 6,000 people. Several South Florida buildings were being evacuated as a precation, according to city of Miami and Miami-Dade County officials. No injuries or road closures have been reported. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands see so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. “‘It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,”‘ Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.” Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she had seen manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage. Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway. “It felt to me like i was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,” he said. He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize. The USGS initially reported the magnitude at 7.3.   This is a developing story and will be updated once more information is available.

A tsunami alert was issued for Jamaica and other countries within an bordering the Gulf of Mexico, but quickly expired without any major incident. So far some minor damage has been reported in the Cayman Islands, according to Reuters, but there has been no word of any serious injuries. Footage has begun to emerge of water sloshing around backyard pools, sinkholes and cracks in the earth. Some particularly wild footage shared on social media purported to show water sloshing around and spilling from two large water tanks. While the quake may have been recorded as centered in the Caribbean Sea between the island nations, it resulted from strike-slip faulting, which actually occurs over a larger fault area made up of hundreds of square miles. Despite the lack of major impacts so far, it appears to be the strongest earthquake the region has felt in many years. Dr. Grenville Draper of Florida International University told WPTV that its’s the biggest he’s seen in at least four decades. ""7.7 is pretty high, you want to compare it to the classic 1906 earthquake in San Francisco that was an 8.0, maybe a little more. So this is a pretty significant earthquake.""

It was one of the strongest quakes yet to hit the U.S. territory that has been shaking for the past week. There were no immediate reports of casualties.  Power outages were reported in some parts of Puerto Rico following the quake, Angel Vazquez, emergency management director for the southern coastal city of Ponce, told The Associated Press. “This is one of the strongest quakes to date since it started shaking on Dec. 28,” he said. “It lasted a long time.” Residents in southern coastal towns began posting pictures of partially collapsed homes and large boulders blocking roads as officials urged people to remain calm. Dr. Sindia Alvarado, who lives in the southern coastal town of Penuelas, said she was petrified. “My entire family woke up screaming,” she said. “I though the house was going to crack in half.” At a hotel in the southwest coastal town of Guanica, people panicked as they tried to flee in their cars, only to realize that large boulders were obstructing the only highway heading north to the capital of San Juan, attorney Jose Francisco Benitez told the AP. “There was a state of panic,” he said. “There were even people in their underwear walking around the hotel.” He said he and his girlfriend were in the room when the quake struck. “I have never felt anything like this,” he said. “It was like a giant grabbed our room and shook it.” The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico’s southern region began the night of Dec. 28, with quakes ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to 5.1. Previous quakes of lesser magnitudes in recent days have cracked homes and led to goods falling off supermarket shelves.  One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a 7.3-magnitude quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.

         SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) -- A small earthquake with a 3.2 magnitude rattled the north end of the Gabilan Mountain Range near the town of San Juan Bautista Sunday morning, the USGS reported. The quake struck shortly after 11 a.m. Sunday about 2 miles underground at an epicenter roughly 10 miles west of Hollister, close to the San Andreas Fault. No reports of damage have been received.  Earlier Sunday, a magnitude 3.9 quake struck the Sierra foothills about 14 miles from Chico. That quake was felt as far away as Sacramento.  About 234 earthquakes with magnitudes between 3.0 and 4.0 occur each year in California and Nevada. © Copyright 2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The 7.7 magnitude earthquake was reported about 77 miles north-northwest of Lucea, Jamaica, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Miami-Dade Police reported receiving phone calls of buildings shaking, and chopper footage showed multiple buildings being evacuated, including the Government Center on Northwest 1st Street. Miami-Dade Fire Rescue responded to reports of tremors felt at high-rise structures on S. Dadeland Boulevard, officials said. City of Miami Police said there were reports of vibrations in Downtown and Brickell, where some buildings were voluntarily evacuated, though there was no evacuation order. There were no injuries or damages reported, police said.  ""I can't remember in my lifetime there ever being a report of an earthquake being felt in the City of Miami,"" Mayor Francis Suarez said. Jorge Gomez said he and co-workers were on the 47th floor of the Wells Fargo building Downtown when he started feeling the building swaying. ""We were sitting down, we saw the blinds shaking, we felt sick to our stomachs. When I leaned up against the window, I felt my body moving or the window moving,"" Gomez said. ""We were saying 'the building's shaking, the building's shaking.'""  Miami inspectors were responding to buildings in Downtown to check for structural damages, officials said. Dr. Enrique Arango Arias, head of Cuba's National Seismological Service, told state media that there had been no serious damage or injuries reported. Gov. Carlos Joaquín González of Mexico’s Quintana Roo, which is home to Cancun, Tulum and other popular beach resorts, said the earthquake was felt in multiple parts of the low-lying Caribbean state but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize, but issued a later message saying the danger had passed. The quake was felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Roman Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city.  ""It felt very strong but it doesn't look like anything happened,'' she told The Associated Press. It was also felt a little farther east at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the southeastern coast of the island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages, said J. Overton, a spokesman for the installation, which has a total population of about 6,000 people. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands experience so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. “It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,” Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.” Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she saw manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage. Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway. “It felt to me like I was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,” he said. He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica.","City of Miami Police said there were reports of vibrations in Downtown and Brickell, where some buildings were voluntarily evacuated, though there was no evacuation order.

Please enter a search term.       PARMA, Ohio (WJW) — Relief efforts are underway in Northeast Ohio for Puerto Rico earthquake victims. Joel Rodriguez, 23, of Parma, has relatives there.  He shared pictures and video taken of his family Tuesday morning; his relatives were unable to return to their homes which have cracked walls and homes knocked off foundations. All the devastation caused by two powerful earthquakes just hours apart. “At first, I took it, okay, it happened once; I said, ‘it won’t happen again.’ And then I heard that it kept happening.” Rodriguez spoke with relatives — an aunt, uncles and cousins– throughout the day; many still describing where they were and what they felt when the 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck. “She also said that it felt like the earth was just moving and it was just raised and she said it was the longest minute of her life.” Gerardo Colon, a local firefighter, said his parents and grandparents are still on the island and are okay. “I have some family here in the states, but the majority of them are there, the elders.” Colon was unable to get in contact with them for two weeks after hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017, and this latest natural disaster stirred up old emotions with massive power outages, no water and little food on an island of more than three million people. “They were dealing more with more of the PTSD of blackouts, shortages, stuff like that.” As for now, looking at photos of relatives in prayer is helping to calm fears, as the United States is already setting aside $130 million to deal with the crisis. Colon added, “Hopefully it’ll be over soon and everything will be okay.” Relief efforts are already underway here at home.

573,A 6.5 magnitude earthquake hit Puerto Rico a day after another quake rocked the island,2020-01-07 15:56 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/us/puerto-rico-earthquake-tuesday/index.html,"
      Hours after a deadly 6.4 magnitude earthquake rocked Puerto Rico, people on the southern coast fear more homes could collapse and most of the people on the island remain without power.
   
      Tuesday’s quake – the strongest and likely the most damaging of a series of quakes that have hit the island since December 28 – left a man dead, caused dozens of homes and structures to crumble and cut power and water service to swaths of the island. 
   
      Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with people to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks. 
   
      “We have responded to many difficult situations, and here we are once again,” Vázquez said.
   I continue to feel the ground shake often in Guanica, PR. Here are some of the images we’ve captured this afternoon. pic.twitter.com/5m6w9WmvHu 
      Engineers were working to reestablish service to close to 300,000 of the island’s 1.1 million utility customers who were without water service Tuesday, Vázquez said. 
   
      The 6.4 quake struck at 4:24 a.m. (3:24 a.m. ET). It centered off Puerto Rico’s southern coast, about 6 miles south Indios, a town of about 1,500 people, the US Geological Survey said. Several aftershocks followed, including a magnitude 5.6 temblor striking south of Indios at 7:18 a.m., USGS said. 
   
      In Guanica, families sat on white plastic chairs and cots in the parking lot of the Mariano “Tito” Rodriguez Municipal Coliseum. About 255 have taken shelter there since a 5.8 magnitude quake shook the US territory Monday, but officials now fear the building is not stable. 
   
      “My home is like a hammock,” Guanica resident Hector Cruz said. “It’s like a drill coming from underneath the home.”
   
      The earthquakes come after Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory in September 2017, and many in southern Puerto Rico say the earthquakes’ damage is worse. 
   
      “There’s no warnings for this,” Puerto Rico Police Commissioner Henry Escalera said of the earthquakes. “A hurricane gives us time to plan ahead.”
   
      In Ponce, roughly a 15-mile drive east of Indios, a 77-year-old man was killed and at least eight others were injured Tuesday, the city’s emergency management director, Angel Vasquez, said.
   
      More than 400,000 of Puerto Rico’s 3.1 million people would have felt strong shaking, the USGS estimates, though the entire island would have felt lesser effects.
   
      Authorities provided tents to help residents sleep outdoors Tuesday night, Guanica Deputy Mayor Zulma Bracero said. Nothing seems safe, she said, and the situation is worse than Maria’s aftermath.
   
      Riko Gonzalez and his parents were sleeping in their home in Yauco, near Indios, when the 6.4 quake struck. They awoke to a rumble and scurried out of the house. China and glasses smashed on the kitchen floor, he said.
   
      It was “horrible, nothing compared to the (magnitude) 5s from yesterday,” Gonzalez said. “People are afraid to go to bed, to then be woken up to worse earthquakes than the day before.”

      In Guayanilla, north of Indios, the Inmaculada Conception Church was in ruins. Part of an exterior wall collapsed, and piles of rubble lay on the ground, pictures posted to Facebook show.
   
      Homes also were damaged in Guayanilla, Mayor Nelson Torres told CNN affiliate WAPA.
   
      The Guayanilla area already was counting losses from a day earlier. A significant tourist attraction, the coastal Punta Ventana rock formation and arch, collapsed in Monday’s shaking, the mayor said.
   
      Workers at Hospital Damas in Ponce were evacuating all patients except for those in intensive care, Executive Director Dr. Pedro Benitez told WAPA.
   
      “(Patients) were running around the hallways, so we had to get them out of the building for their own safety,” he said.
   
      Tuesday’s quake continues a series of seismic events that have shaken Puerto Rico for 11 days. Hundreds of small earthquakes have hit the island since December 28, the USGS says, including at least 29 over magnitude 4.0.
   
Monday morning’s 5.8 tremor struck south of Indios. The quake damaged some homes in Guanica and Guayanilla, but no serious injuries were reported.
   
      The earthquakes appear to have been foreshocks to Tuesday morning’s larger quake, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said.
   
      Tuesday’s quake “will trigger aftershocks, but these will decrease in frequency over time,” the USGS said.
   
      It likely will be the island’s most damaging earthquake in a century. 
   
      In 1918, a strong quake shook Puerto Rico, causing a tsunami and resulting in 116 deaths and economic loss of $4 million, two times the island’s annual budget at the time, according to the Puerto Rico Seismic Network. That’s about $73 million today.
   
      It’s the largest earthquake to hit Puerto Rico since 2014, when a 6.4 magnitude quake struck 61 miles northeast of the island. It briefly disrupted power but caused only minor damage to Puerto Rico, as it was centered much father off shore than Tuesday’s earthquake.
   
      The full extent of damages is unclear, but experts say the island could need hundreds of millions of dollars in aid.
   
      One expert, Chuck Watson, an analyst with Georgia-based disaster research group Enki Research, believes the quakes could cost the island up to $3.1 billion in losses, he said.
   
      The estimate includes damage to public and private property, and lost tourism, wages and business due to power outages. USGS estimates the earthquakes could cause  losses of more than $100 million. 
   
      Watson’s estimate includes how multiple aftershocks can potentially damage weak structures, as well as the lingering damage left by Hurricane Maria, he said. Some of the infrastructure damage from the 2017 storm still is not repaired, the American Society of Civil Engineers says.
   
      Following hurricanes Irma and Maria, Congress appropriated $42 billion to the recovery effort, $16 billion of which went through FEMA, $20 billion through Housing and Urban Development, and the remainder through more than a dozen smaller agencies.
   
      Only about $14 billion of the funds has been spent.

         SAN JUAN (CBSMiami/AP) -- A 6.4 magnitude earthquake and several other strong tremors rocked Puerto Rico Tuesday morning, killing one man and injuring at least eight others. It happened just one day after a 5.8 magnitude quake shook the island, according to the US Geological Survey. The earthquake caused buildings to collapse in the southern part of the island and was followed by a series of strong aftershocks, part of a 10-day series of temblors spawned by the grinding of tectonic plates along three faults beneath southern Puerto Rico. CBS4's Peter D'Oench spoke with people on Tuesday inside the baggage claim area at Miami International Airport after arriving from Puerto Rico.  ""Yesterday and today, it was crazy,"" said Jesuan Ruiz. ""I was in my parents' house and the glasses were breaking down along with the dinner table. A lot of stuff came down. I went with my kid and tried to stay on top of him because I was afraid the ceiling would fall down. You could hear the sound. It was like woo, woo, woo and It was really a scary experience. I wanted to get my family off the island but it was very expensive."" ""It was absolutely terrifying and the actual shock was very scary,"" recalled Robert Lopez Erezarri. ""In one sense we were lucky it struck so early in the morning because if later, a lot of people out and about could have been hurt."" Francis Rodriguez was with her family. ""During the earthquake it was very frightening. Some things shifted all over the place. We have not experienced earthquakes like this in over a hundred years."" Many residents are still shaken by memories of Hurricane Maria in September of 2017.  It devastated the island and killed nearly 3,000 people. Some authorities have said most of the island's infrastructure is in ""poor condition."" Miami resident Melinda Mizrachi spent her entire two-week Christmas vacation in Puerto Rico where she has family and a second home and felt the ground moving while she was there. ""I am not sure on what the magnitudes were, but I know one of them was at least a 5 and I was in my living room laying down on my sofa and my whole entire sofa was shaking and moving. I felt like I was on a rollercoaster ride,"" described Mizrachi to CBSMiami.com. Puerto Rico experienced a flurry of earthquakes since December 28, according to data from the USGS, ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to Sunday's 5.8. All of the earthquakes appear to have been foreshocks to Tuesday morning's largest quake. Melinda and her teenage son returned to Miami on Sunday night, just before the two biggest earthquakes struck. ""I don't know how my house is at the moment, but I have been told by a friend of mine that lives in my same neighborhood that the whole entire island is without power,"" she said. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority is reporting widespread outages across the island after power plants shutdown to protect themselves. Authorities said two plants suffered light damage and they expected power to be restored later Tuesday.  ""My heart is broken,"" said Mizrachi. ""I am happy that my son and I were able to get off of the island, but a part of me wishes I was back there by myself being able to help out any way that I can. The island has just started to get back to some kind of normal from Hurricane Maria and to see this now and seeing pictures of homes, roads and buildings collapsing is just devastating to me.  I am scheduled to go back there next month to run a half marathon but now I just want to go just to assess the damages to my home and help out any way that I can."" Due to the recent earthquakes, Nova Southeastern University's Puerto Rico Regional Campus is closed Tuesday. All classes are suspended, including for online students. Seismologists say it's impossible to predict when the quakes will stop. CBS4 also spoke with Professor Jorge Duany, who is an expert on Puerto Rico and is also Director of the Cuban Research Institute at F.I.U. ""One of the most immediate concerns is that residents are scared and people are leaving the island but I think that will be a short term impact. I think the most important long term impact will be the structural damage to properties. There are hundreds of thousands of homes that could be vulnerable to earthquakes, particularly areas near the coast that are prone to flooding and tsunamis."" Duany said the island was still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Maria three years ago and the turbulent times during protests against the island's Governor. Duany said the island's population was holding at 3.2 million and had stopped its decline after an exodus of some residents after Maria. (© Copyright 2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Courtesy of the Associated Press    Courtesy of the Associated Press    HAVANA (AP) – A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday, shaking a vast area from Mexico to Florida and beyond, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or heavy damage.  The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. “It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,” she told The Associated Press. It was also felt a little further east at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the southeastern coast of the island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages, said J. Overton, a spokesman for the installation, which has a total population of about 6,000 people. Several South Florida buildings were being evacuated as a precaution, according to the city of Miami and Miami-Dade County officials. No injuries or road closures have been reported. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands see so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. “It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,” Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.” Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she had seen manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage. Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway. “It felt to me like I was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,” he said. He said he had seen no damage around his home in northern Jamaica. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize.

A magnitude 7.7 earthquake occurred between Cuba and Jamaica on Tuesday afternoon. The epicenter was located in the Caribbean Sea about 83 miles north of Montego Bay, the capital of St. James, and about 87 miles south of Granma, Cuba, according to the United States Geological Survey service. It was a relatively strong but shallow quake with a depth of about 6 miles. A 7.7 magnitude earthquake is at the high end of the Richter Scale. It was initially reported at 7.3 but was quickly revised up to 7.7. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages. Residents as far as Miami said they felt tremors from the powerful quake. Robert Lee, who was working on the 25th floor of the Miami Tower in Downtown Miami at the time, said he could feel the building ""swaying back and forth."" ""It was crazy! I looked up and saw a light fixture swaying and I got out,"" Lee told ABC News. He said there were easily hundreds of people outside at one point. Police in Miami said there were no injuries reported there. Andrew Jowett, a lawyer who works on Grand Cayman, said he has seen no sign of major infrastructure damage in the area, but noticed a few broken windows and cracks in surrounding buildings. He said he felt a few small aftershocks in the hours after the initial quake. “People are afraid a tsunami may be on its way,” Jowett told ABC News. “I can hear lots of sirens and there’s heavy traffic everywhere but there doesn’t seem to be anything major wrong.” He said was on the British Virgin Islands for Hurricane Irma and this is nothing remotely comparable. Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago, Cuba, said she felt the impact there. She said there was no apparent damage. “Apparently there are some cracks in the road at cricket square,” he said, and “there are sink holes around some sewers or drains.” ""We were all sitting, and we felt the chairs move,"" Guerrero told The Associated Press after the quake.

The quake hit shortly after 7 p.m. and hit nearly 14.2 miles north-northeast from Barstow, according to the USGS. The depth of the shallow temblor was about 2.3 miles. Six minutes later, a 2.9 aftershock struck the same area. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones tweeted following the quake, saying that it was scientifically interesting as it occurred on an unmapped thrust fault. People reported feeling the quake across a large swath of Southern California, including Lancaster, Fontana, Apple Valley and Glendale. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

         BARSTOW (CBSLA) — A 4.6-magnitude earthquake jolted Southern California just after 7 p.m. Friday night. The quake's epicenter was 2.3 miles deep and about 14 miles north-northeast of Barstow. It was felt from San Clemente to Palmdale and even Las Vegas. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said this quake was widely felt because of its Intensity 2 rating. ""The intensity number tells you what you're feeling,"" she said. ""Intensity 2 is the type of earthquake where you have to be sitting down quietly and, 'Oh, was that an earthquake?' Where as most of the people, if you're walking around at all, you'll completely miss it."" Jones said while it looked like a wide distribution of people who felt it, it was actually a small percentage across the Southland who felt it. A 2.9-magnitude earthquake struck less than a mile away six minutes later. Jones said, like always, there's about a 5% chance that a bigger temblor will follow. I sure wish I could tell when a quake is going to be a foreshock. I spent many years looking at foreshocks to try to find something that made them different.  Never found it. We will know if it's one of the 5% that become a foreshock if something bigger happens.     ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Watch CBS News

Please enter a valid zipcode. Save ORLANDO, Fla. â Puerto Ricans woke up Saturday morning to a new earthquake. An earthquake occurred off the southern coast of Puerto Rico, southwest of Ponce. The earthquake was originally classified as a magnitude 6.0, but U.S. Geological Service downgraded it to a 5.9. Since then, there have been several aftershocks, with one registering 5.2 in magnitude. Power outages are being reported across much of the southern part of the island. Crews are assessing power plants for damage. This is an area that's been devastated by earthquakes over the past few weeks. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake hit Puerto Rico Friday afternoon in the same general area. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Puerto Rico has experienced more than 139 earthquakes at a magnitude of 3.0 or greater.  As of Friday afternoon, USGS said six of the quakes were magnitude 5.0+.  Hundreds of thousands of people are already without water and power on the island because of the earthquakes, and thousands are staying in shelters or sleeping outside after an earthquake Tuesday destroyed homes, businesses and schools.  USGS officials say Puerto Rico is tectonically active, so infrequent large earthquakes should be expected. Before the current spate of earthquakes, within the last 50 years there had been 10 earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.0+.  The Tsunami Warning Center says there is no tsunami threat expected from the earthquake. This is a developing story. Check back for the latest developments.  Information from the Associated Press was used in this report.    ","An earthquake occurred off the southern coast of Puerto Rico, southwest of Ponce.

The quake was followed by a series of strong aftershocks, part of a 10-day series of temblors spawned by the grinding of tectonic plates along three faults beneath southern Puerto Rico. Seismologists say it's impossible to predict when the quakes will stop or whether they will get stronger. The 6.4-magnitude quake cut power to the island as power plants shut down to protect themselves. Authorities said two plants suffered light damage and they expected power to be restored later Tuesday. Puerto Rico's main airport was operating normally, using generator power.

There is an active movement of passengers due to the holiday season. #PuertoRicoEarthquake #earthquakes #TemblorPR pic.twitter.com/iadjTipJUG  Puerto Rico's governor, Wanda Vásquez, declared a state of emergency and activated the territory's National Guard. She said some 300,000 households remained without running water by late Tuesday afternoon, and several hundred people were in shelters in affected municipalities. She said she had not spoken to President Donald Trump by late morning. Teacher Rey González told The Associated Press that his uncle was killed when a wall collapsed on him at the home they shared in the city of Ponce. He said 73-year-old Nelson Martínez was disabled and that he and his father cared for him.  Eight people were injured in the city of Ponce, near the epicenter of the quake, Mayor Mayita Meléndez told WAPA television. Hundreds of people sat in the streets of the city, some cooking food on barbeque grills, afraid to return home for fear of structural damage and aftershocks.  Video from a Telemundo broadcast showed the moment the 5.8 aftershock hit. “We can’t predict how long this will keep going,"" John Geiger, a geophysicist with USGS, told NBC. ""There will be aftershocks. Usually, they are smaller than the main shock but that’s not always the case.” He said that statistically there is a 3 percent chance within the next week of a quake larger than the 6.4 quake that hit. The odds of a larger one go down after that, according to historic statistics from quakes.  A tsunami alert was initially issued for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but later canceled. Trump was briefed on the earthquakes in Puerto Rico in the past month, including the one on Tuesday, said Judd Deere, White House deputy press secretary. “Administration officials, including FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, have been in touch with the Governor and her team today, and we will continue to monitor the effects and coordinate with Puerto Rico officials,"" Deere said. In the historic district of Ponce, authorities evacuated more than 150 people from two buildings they said were in danger of collapsing. Among them were more than two dozen elderly patients from a nursing home who sat in their wheelchairs in silence as the earth continued to tremble. Amir Señeriz leaned against the cracked wall of his Freemason Lodge in Ponce and wailed. The roof of the 1915 building was partially collapsed and dust and debris lay around him. Outside, he had already carefully placed 10 large historic paintings. The earth continued trembling as he went back into the building to recover more artifacts. Helping him was artist Nelson Figueroa, 44, who said he slept in his street clothes. “It was chaos,” he said, adding that there was a traffic jam in his coastal neighborhood as terrified people fled. Much of the damage was reported in the southwest coastal town of Guayanilla, where the mayor said the municipality won't have power for at least two weeks. A 19th-century church in Guayanilla partially collapsed. Ruth Caravallo, 73, held on to the church’s wrought-iron gate as she cried. “My sister was the secretary here,” she said. “My husband died two months ago, and I held services for him here.” Around the corner, Father Melvin Díaz spoke to a friend on the phone and described damage to the church's icons. “The Virgin fell, Saint Judas is intact,” he said, chuckling. Díaz surveyed the collapsed church and said he was optimistic about rebuilding. “This isn't a problem, it's a challenge,"" he said. Some people rode their bicycles around the public plaza while others sought shade under lush trees that shook occasionally as the aftershocks continued. In one corner of the plaza, 74-year-old Alvin Rivera paused as he scrutinized the damage around him. “It's terribly sad,” he said. “People are panicked.""

One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a magnitude 7.3 quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people. “It’s definitely expected there will be aftershocks for sure, but how long that will last we don’t know,” said Geiger with USGS.   Recent 2.5+ Magnitude Earthquakes Near Puerto Rico  Dec. 28, 2019 to Jan. 7, 2020   --NBC's Sophie Reardon and Daniel Macht contributed to this story.","A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck Puerto Rico before dawn on Tuesday, killing one man, injuring at least eight other people, knocking out power and collapsing buildings in the southern part of the island.
The quake was followed by a series of strong aftershocks, part of a 10-day series of temblors spawned by the grinding of tectonic plates along three faults beneath southern Puerto Rico.
Authorities said two plants suffered light damage and they expected power to be restored later Tuesday.
Usually, they are smaller than the main shock but that’s not always the case.” He said that statistically there is a 3 percent chance within the next week of a quake larger than the 6.4 quake that hit.
Trump was briefed on the earthquakes in Puerto Rico in the past month, including the one on Tuesday, said Judd Deere, White House deputy press secretary.
“Administration officials, including FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, have been in touch with the Governor and her team today, and we will continue to monitor the effects and coordinate with Puerto Rico officials,"" Deere said.
In the historic district of Ponce, authorities evacuated more than 150 people from two buildings they said were in danger of collapsing.
Much of the damage was reported in the southwest coastal town of Guayanilla, where the mayor said the municipality won't have power for at least two weeks.

      Hundreds of people were evacuated from high-rise buildings near downtown Miami after a powerful earthquake in the Caribbean Sea on Tuesday. 
   
      Several buildings in Miami were shaking Tuesday but no injuries or structural damage has been reported, Miami police and fire officials tweeted.
    
      Jose Borrego was in a work meeting at the Bank of America building in the Brickell neighborhood when he “felt slight movement of the building.” When he came outside, he said he noticed every building in the area was being evacuated.
   
      “The evacuation was pretty smooth, but all in all anxious about the state of emergency and the lack of information regarding the situation,” said Borrego, an employee of software company Kaseya.
   
      At least eight buildings in the area decided to evacuate following the earthquake, Miami City Commissioner Ken Russell told CNN affiliate WPLG.
   
      The Stephen P. Clark Government Center was closed as a precaution, Miami-Dade county officials said. 
   
      Jose Abreu, an employee at another high-rise, said he felt the walls vibrating for about 90 seconds but thought it was a malfunctioning fan.
   
      “I thought it was the fan acting up on me. I didn’t think anything of it,” he said. “I just went along, until the building announcement came through the speakers and I just evacuated in the back of the building.”
   
      Others in Miami’s financial district told CNN they didn’t feel shaking but were concerned about retrieving items from their offices.

 was centered 139 kilometers (86 miles) northwest of Montego Bay, 
Jamaica, and 140 kilometers (87 miles) west-southwest of Niquero, Cuba. 
It hit at 2:10 p.m. (1910 GMT) and the epicenter was a relatively 
shallow 10 kilometers (6 miles) beneath the surface. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.  The
 quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest far-eastern Cuban
 city, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in 
the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. “It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,” she told The Associated Press.  The
 quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what 
appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no 
immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin

It was felt by some locals in the Las Vegas Valley. “The Barstow area is in a geologically active area like we are and like Ridgecrest. So it shouldn’t be too surprising to have decent magnitude quakes throughout the Mojave,” seismologist Jose Bunde said. “I haven’t seen where the epicenter has been calculated, but there are faults like the ones in our valley called dip slip faults and there are faults like the San Andreas called strike- slip faults in that area. I won’t be surprised if there are a series of aftershocks, some in the 4’s for the next couple weeks.”  You can help out the United States Geological survey by filling out a “Felt Report.” You can find the link in the tweet below.

Members of Breath of God Lutheran Church in Baltimore's Highlandtown neighborhood have been traveling to the island for the past three summers to help residents rebuild after hurricanes Irma and Maria. Now, they're planning another trip as nearly one-third of residents in the American territory remain in the dark in the wake of the deadly 6.4-magnitude quake. Pastor Mark Parker said while their work might be more extensive this time around, their commitment to the people of Puerto Rico remains the same. ""The sense of despair and hopelessness that that brings after having rebuilt is a familiar refrain from those friends,"" said Bishop William Gohl. The church is now recruiting close to 200 volunteers to join in its efforts this coming summer. ""Whether it be rebuilding some of the things we had done or put into place before or something completely different,"" volunteer Victoria Broderick said. The mission is intended to help re-establish and strengthen homes, businesses and places of worship. ""You see signs of that resilience that you've built into the physical infrastructure,"" Parker said. To sign up to volunteer or make a donation, click here.   ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

 ELAZIG, TURKEY — Turkey called off rescue operations on Monday in eastern areas hit by Friday's earthquake after emergency workers recovered the body of a final person they were searching for in a collapsed building, bringing the death toll to 41, authorities said. The magnitude 6.8 quake caused 37 deaths in Elazig province, about 550 km (340 miles) east of Ankara, and four in neighboring Malatya. More than 1,600 others were hurt, including 86 still being treated in hospitals, though none were in serious condition, the government said. Forty-five people had been rescued from under ruined buildings, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Authority (AFAD) said. Authorities have warned residents not to enter damaged buildings because of the danger of collapse and further aftershocks, leaving many without a home in a region where temperatures fell to -6C (21F) on Monday morning. Addressing reporters in Elazig, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the government would provide financial support to those whose homes were damaged. Some 1,000 temporary homes would be built, and some schools and mosques were now being used as shelters, he added. Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said authorities had started demolishing 22 damaged buildings in Elazig. Construction of some 2,000 new houses in the province was expected to be completed by year end, he added. Turkey has a history of powerful earthquakes. More than 17,000 people were killed in August 1999 when a 7.6 magnitude quake struck Izmit, a city southeast of Istanbul. In 2011, a quake in the eastern city of Van killed more than 500.

You can read more about the Puerto Rico earthquakes here. From CNN's Gregory Wallace FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, received Puerto Rico's request for an emergency declaration from the earthquake that occurred earlier Tuesday, and that request is under consideration, the agency said. Acting FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor has been in constant communication and coordination with Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vazquez, FEMA said. FEMA personnel in Puerto Rico are working closely with the Puerto Rico Emergency Management Bureau and have deployed two Incident Management Assistance Teams to the island, the agency said. Additionally, FEMA activated its Response Operations Cell in Washington and Regional Response Coordination Center in New York to assist with any additional resource needs. ""FEMA remains committed to supporting the government of Puerto Rico with its ongoing recovery efforts from Hurricanes Irma and Maria and to helping people before, during and after disasters,"" the agency said.  From CNN's Kate Trafecante The earthquakes along the southern coast of Puerto Rico could cost the island up to $3.1 billion in economic losses, according to Chuck Watson, an analyst with Enki, a disaster research group.  The estimate accounts for damage to both public and private property, as well as lost tourism, wages and business due to power outages. Watson said the estimate is high due to multiple aftershocks hitting already weak structures, as well as the lingering effects of Hurricane Maria. Some of the infrastructure damage from the 2017 storm has still not been repaired, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. CNN’s Angela Barajas contributed to this report. From CNN’s Angela Barajas Puerto Rico's Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced announced Tuesday that $130 million in emergency aid has been made available in response to both earthquakes. The governor also pleaded for everyone to remain calm and to prepare for any future seismic activity at a Tuesday morning news conference. Vázquez said preliminary findings show that 255 people have sought refuge at different shelters in the southern part of the island. Close to 300,000 clients are without water service, she said. Vazquez said there are power outages throughout the southern part of the island but engineers are already working on reestablishing service. Power plants had automatically shut off as a safety mechanism following Monday's quake, but Tuesday's quake caused damage to them, according to the governor. Damage to some roads was reported -- but there were no reports of significant damage to bridges or dams.  “We have responded to many difficult situations, and here we are once again and we will do it the same way, helping our people move forward.” said Vázquez.  From CNN's Betsy Klein President Donald Trump has been briefed on the earthquakes in Puerto Rico. ""The President has been briefed on the earthquakes that Puerto Rico has experienced over the past month, including the earthquake early this morning,"" spokesman Judd Deere said. ""Administration officials, including FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, have been in touch with the governor and her team today, and we will continue to monitor the effects and coordinate with Puerto Rico officials."" From CNN's Amanda Watts New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is redirecting personnel from the New York Power Authority who were already deployed in Puerto Rico to help restore power following several earthquakes that have hit the island, a statement from his office says. ""During difficult times, the State of New York always stands with and supports our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico -- and today is no different,"" Gov. Cuomo said.  The NYPA already had a team of ten technical power experts on the island assisting Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria. The team “has been working to address recent blackouts and stabilize the island's power systems to avoid power outages,” the statement says.  “Once this team has completed its work to help restore power after the earthquake, it will resume its collaborative efforts with PREPA to harden Puerto Rico's electric system so it is better prepared to withstand all kinds of natural disasters in the future.”  Riko Gonzalez described the 6.0 and 6.4 earthquakes as ""horrible."" ""People are afraid to go to bed to then be woken up to worse earthquakes than the day before."" Gonzalez shared a number of photos on Facebook that show the rubble and destruction around Yauco, a city in southwest Puerto Rico. ""Luckily (communications) are up so we check on each other periodically. But if it wasn’t for that there would be panic,"" Gonzalez said.     The earthquakes on Monday and Tuesday struck to the southwest of Puerto Rico, at the opposite end of the island from its capital, San Juan. The US Geological Survey said that they struck in the area where the North American tectonic plate converges with the Caribbean tectonic plate. Gov. Wanda Vazquez Garced has signed a state of emergency declaration for the island, thus activating the National Guard of Puerto Rico.

 A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday, shaking a vast area from Mexico to Florida and beyond, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or heavy damage.  Dr. Enrique Arango Arias, head of Cuba's National Seismological Service, told state media that there had been no serious damage or injuries reported. The quake was felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Roman Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago. ""We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,"" she said. ""We heard the noise of everything moving around."" She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. ""It felt very strong but it doesn't look like anything happened,"" she told The Associated Press. It was also felt a little farther east at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the southeastern coast of the island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages, said J. Overton, a spokesman for the installation, which has a total population of about 6,000 people. Several South Florida buildings were evacuated as a precaujtion, according to city of Miami and Miami-Dade County officials. No injuries or road closures had been reported. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. Witness reports The islands experience so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. ""It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,"" Morales said. ""Then it continued and got more intense."" Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she saw manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage. Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway. ""It felt to me like I was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,"" he said.

Please enter a valid zipcode. Save SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico â One of the strongest earthquakes in a generation rattled Puerto Rico before dawn Tuesday, the second one in as many days. At least one person is dead, and the governor has declared a state of emergency.   At least eight people were injured in the city of Ponce, near the epicenter of the quake, Mayor Mayita MelÃ©ndez told WAPA television. Roads in Tallaboa, west of Ponce, were impassable, and some buildings severely damaged. Puerto Rico's power authority said on Twitter that one of the country's main power plants, which sits near the epicenter, had been damaged. Officials said they expected to restore power to the island later Tuesday.  The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at magnitude 6.4, with more than two dozen aftershocks ranging from 3.8 to 5.8. In a Facebook Messenger interview, Felix J. Quirindongo Muniz of Altamonte Springs shared pictures with Spectrum News 13 that his family and friends took of the destruction in the U.S. territory. He also shared his worry for his family who live in Puerto Rico.  ""It's overwhelming, really. My dad is bedridden, and we're going to try to move here. It's hard. There's no power in the whole island and no news from Vieques and Culebra,"" Muniz said. He said his parents and cousins are moving to another house because their home was damaged in Tuesday's quake.  ""Cousins moving together also, just to be together and help each other. Some cracks on the walls and ceilings. They don't want to risk it ...,"" he shared.  Camille Feliciano, 73, lives in the western region of Puerto Rico. She said she thought she was safe from the earthquake but woke to her home shaking.  ""I was sleeping in the second floor, so I ran down then went outside, and then the lights went out,"" Feliciano said.  Feliciano said she is afraid a bigger earthquake may hit her island.  âYou just feel very anxious, because you donât know if itâs going to continue or if itâs going to get worse,"" she said. Tampa resident Vilmari Nazario has family in Ponce, near the epicenter. She says they are nervous and scared, but otherwise OK. It stirred up feelings reminiscent of those moments following Hurricane Maria. âYeah, I feel a lot of fear, anxiety because I have family and friends there and itâs hard being so far away and not being with them,â she said. At least one person was reported dead. Teacher Rey GonzÃ¡lez told the Associated Press that his uncle was killed when a wall collapsed on him at the home they shared. He said 73-year-old Nelson MartÃ­nez was disabled and that he and his father cared for him. Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda VÃ¡zquez Garced has signed a state of emergency declaration and activated the island's National Guard. She tweeted in Spanish that the government is ready to assist. Espero que todos estÃ©n bien. Estamos recibiendo la informaciÃ³n de @NMEADpr y @DSPnoticias. Todo el componente gubernamental estÃ¡ activado y en ejecuciÃ³n. A nuestro pueblo calma y les exhortamos a que permanezcan seguros. Both Florida U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, along with Puerto Rico Rep. Jenniffer GonzÃ¡lez-ColÃ³n, sent a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to approve the governor's disaster declaration request. On Monday, a 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck the island, with its epicenter near Indios. It led to widespread power outages and small landslides, with cars crushed and boulders blocking highways. For those in Florida with family back on the island, getting in touch with loved ones was critical after seeing images of the aftermath. ""It's very sad for all the families that are suffering from this catastrophe,"" said Aldofina Ortiz who lives in Orlando but has family living in Puerto Rico. In September 2017, Hurricane Maria ravaged the island. Some residents in remote, mountainous areas were still living without power almost two years later. According to the Puerto Rico Seismic Network, one of the strongest earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico struck in 1918. That quake was 7.3 and caused severe damage to bridges and homes and triggered landslides and a tsunami. The 1918 quake killed 116 people. In the wake of the earthquakes, airlines are waiving change and cancellation fees for travelers to and from the island this week.  Most passengers Spectrum News spoke to at Orlando International Airport coming from San Juan, Puerto Rico, said they were concerned to leave their family behind, given the circumstances.  Irving Ocasio from Fajardo said the island needs all the help it can get. ""The island is not 100 percent what it was. After Hurricane Maria the electricity comes and goes. Right after these trembles the island went pitch black... The electrical system in Puerto Rico needs help,"" he described. Help from the Mainland The Hispanic Federation is teaming up with other organizations to help the people on the island. The organization has already distributed 30,000 solar lamps to those in Puerto Rico who donât have power. ""A light makes a difference. Itâs a hope in the midst of the dark, so we know its essential for our families there,"" said Yanidsi Velez, Florida Director of the Hispanic Federation. Velez said the team is still in the early stages of planning, but the group is getting ready to help the people living in Puerto Rico like they did for Hurricane Maria. If you like to help the Hispanic Federation, head to the group's website.

1174,Kansas Sierra Club looks for solutions after Hutchinson earthquake,2020-01-21 00:17 UTC,https://www.ksnt.com/capitol-bureau/kansas-sierra-club-looks-for-solutions-after-hutchinson-earthquake/,"KSNT 27 News Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.     TOPEKA, Kan. (KSNT) – A Kansas environmental group said the Hutchinson earthquake is just another example of the increasing trend of stronger earthquakes in the state. The Kansas Sierra Club lobbies to lawmakers on all issues that could affect the environment. It said something needs to be done about the earthquakes. The United States Geological Survey shows that the number of magnitude 3.0 or greater earthquakes in the central part of the country has jumped to more than 300 in 2017. The average used to be 25 from 1973-2008. The Sierra Club points to the oil and gas industry with fracking and injecting water underground. “If these are man-made earthquakes and they’re caused by an industry or industries, then we need to do something about it, because Kansans, whether it’s their homes and businesses, are feeling these earthquakes, and property’s getting damaged, and taxpayers having to pick up the bill,” said Zack Pistora, legislative director for the Kansas Sierra Club. The U.S.G.S. said fracking and wastewater removal can be linked to earthquakes, but it’s not always the case. Pistora said the group will continue to work throughout the legislative session for stronger restrictions to prevent earthquakes. “These are issues that Kansans need protection on,” Pistora said. He said the Sierra Club has introduced bills in the past that would address these issues that haven’t gotten the attention he believes they deserve. Restrictions could focus on the location of fracking and the amount that would be allowed. They could come from the Kansas Corporation Commission. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

Dr. Enrique Arango Arias, head of Cuba’s National Seismological Service, told state media that there had been no serious damage or injuries reported. Advertisement Gov. Carlos Joaquín González of Mexico’s Quintana Roo, which is home to Cancun, Tulum and other popular beach resorts, said the earthquake was felt in multiple parts of the low-lying Caribbean state but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.  The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize, but issued a later message saying the danger had passed.  The initial tremor was followed by a series of strong aftershocks, including one measured at magnitude 6.1.  The quake was felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Roman Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. ‘‘It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,'’ she told The Associated Press.  It was also felt a little farther east at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the southeastern coast of the island. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages, said J. Overton, a spokesman for the installation, which has a total population of about 6,000 people.  Advertisement Several South Florida buildings were evacuated as a precaution, according to city of Miami and Miami-Dade County officials. No injuries or road closures were reported. No shaking was felt at the Hard Rock stadium in Miami Gardens, which will host the Super Bowl on Sunday.  The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper.  The islands experience so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said.  “It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,” Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.”  Dr. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she saw manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage.  Claude Diedrick, 71, who owns a fencing business in Montego Bay, said he was sitting in his vehicle reading when the earth began to sway.  “It felt to me like I was on a bridge and like there were two or three heavy trucks and the bridge was rocking but there were no trucks,” he said.

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Local utilities are looking for new ways to make Southern California earthquake safe, and one way is by replacing aging water pipes. The new pipes could help keep the water flowing after a big one hits. LADWP is replacing critical areas along its 7,000 miles of water pipes in Los Angeles with earthquake resilient pipes to ensure water is still flowing after the shaking stops. ""We live in earthquake country. The Northridge earthquake is another reminder for us to make sure that we develop an infrastructure that is resilient where we can bounce back and provide reliable water supplies to our customers after a large earthquake event,"" said Alvin Bautista of LADWP. RELATED | How to make your own earthquake kit  LADWP joined Japan's earthquake resilient pipe network in 2013, making L.A. the United States' first public utility system to use the earthquake resilient pipe. It involves a stronger steel pipe coating and a joint that doesn't crack during shaking. ""Our regular pipe does not have this type of freedom of movement, so the material that we use has it, so it will allow for a certain amount of expansion and contraction, it also gives it a degree of freedom where it can rotate along the axis there so that it doesn't break with excessive movement underground,"" said Bautista. LADWP's long-term replacement plan will take years to complete; targeted locations in critical earthquake hazard zones were first to receive the earthquake resilient pipe. ""Areas where we need reliable water supply such as hospitals, command and control centers, shelters, areas where people will gather after a large earthquake event, those areas need to be reliable with the water supply, that's our focus,"" said Bautista. Drivers around L.A. will notice construction zones where crews are installing the earthquake resilient pipe. After the replacement is done and the traffic inconvenience is over, L.A. will have the sturdiest water pipes in America.

For the first time, homeowners in cities including Palo Alto, Lancaster, Oxnard, Palm Springs and Fremont are eligible to apply for grants. Last year David Beilfuss of Pasadena described himself as ""house rich and cash poor."" Still, he decided to sign up for a grant from the Earthquake Brace + Bolt program out of fear of becoming homeless. ""My wife and I knew that even with earthquake insurance we needed to do more to protect our family, our home and our investment,"" he said. Homes that were constructed before 1980 and especially before 1940 are particularly vulnerable to being toppled off their foundations. State officials say that critical retrofitting involves bolting the house to the ground and installing plywood bracing known as cripple walls.

Sarah Bloomquist has more on Action News at 4 p.m. on January 8, 2020. WILMINGTON, Delaware (WPVI) -- Cars, cots and plastic chairs became temporary beds for hundreds of families who lost their homes in southwest Puerto Rico as a flurry of earthquakes struck the island, one of them the strongest in a century. The magnitude 6.4 quake that struck before dawn on Tuesday killed one person, injured nine others and knocked out power across the U.S. territory. More than  250,000 Puerto Ricans remained without water on Wednesday and another half a million without power, which also affected telecommunications. The hardest hit municipality was the southwest coastal town of Guánica. More than 200 people had taken shelter in a gymnasium after a quake on Monday, only for the latest shake to damage that structure - forcing them to sleep outside. Kevin Melloy divides his time between Delaware and Puerto Rico where he owns an art gallery. He was waking up very early Tuesday morning when the strong earthquake struck. ""The bed was shaking and I heard this really, really loud, really intense - which was the earthquake - just the seismic activity I guess, it was just everything outside was shaking. And within seconds all the dogs in the neighborhood started barking and then it just went click and all the electric went out."" Melloy flew home to Delaware hours after the quake. He plans to return to Puerto Rico in February. He says the people there are very resilient, but, right now, they need help. Tuesday's quake was the strongest to hit Puerto Rico since October 1918, when a magnitude 7.3 quake struck near the island's northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people. -- The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Local 10 News anchor Calvin Hughes was in Haiti right after the historic earthquake and is back a decade later. The country is still feeling the effects and struggling to recover, even after all these years have passed. The deadly quake was the country’s darkest day, and the new normal still includes daily desperation. Some Haitians have tried to make the best of the situation while still recovering from the earthquake. Some schools that collapsed have reopened, as well as some government buildings. Haiti’s president, Jovenel Moïse, told Hughes he will be addressing the nation on Sunday to discuss the future. Moïse also urges unity among Haitians in the country like the days following the quake. The president stated that there is so much the nation is struggling with, like high inflation, high gas prices and a hunger crisis. For the past 18 months, violent, deadly protests that last for weeks at a time have shut down daily life. The protesters accused Moïse of taking money, and not delivering on a contract from a multi-billion dollar government fund designed for social programs. Haitians in Miami’s Little Haiti neighborhood had a silent march to commemorate and reflect on the devasting day. Johanne St. Leger lost her uncle and father in the earthquake and had been grieving silently for nearly 10 years. “I think it is helpful to be able to share this day with everyone here, I’m sure, whether it’s someone close to them that they’ve lost or just here for support,” said St. Leger.

1441,Feds order Anderson Reservoir be drained to allow necessary earthquake retrofitting,2020-02-25 07:39 UTC,https://abc7news.com/feds-order-south-bay-reservoir-be-drained-due-to-earthquake-risk/5965376/,"WATCH LIVE Federal dam regulators are ordering the biggest reservoir in Santa Clara County to be drained because of earthquake risk. MORGAN HILL, Calif. (KGO) -- Federal dam regulators are ordering the biggest reservoir in Santa Clara County to be drained because of earthquake risk. The Anderson Reservoir sits between Morgan Hill and San Jose, located just east of Highway 101. For years, Valley Water has led the push to rebuild the Anderson Dam. However, plans have been met by obstacles.  In a release to ABC7 News, Valley Water described the Anderson Dam Seismic Retrofit Project (ADSRP) as both ""complicated and time-consuming."" Valley Water CEO Norma Camacho added, ""Valley Water has been working with several state and federal agencies through the years to secure the proper permits as the scope of the project has increased due to additional safety and design requirements, while also complying with federal statutes and regulations, including the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and Clean Water Act."" According to Valley Water's website dedicated to the project, the status is ""on target,"" and ADSRP is in the ""planning"" phase. In a letter written by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Division of Dam Safety and Inspections Director, David Capka said, ""Until full remediation is completed, the dam safety risk at this project is unacceptably high."" The letter to Christopher Hakes, the Deputy Operating Officer of Valley Water's Dam Safety and Capital Delivery Division continued, ""Your actions to date do not demonstrate an appropriate sense of urgency regarding the interim conditions at the project."" FERC ordered the reservoir to be drained, by Oct. 1, so work can start. Residents in the surrounding community are also demanding action. ""I never saw any work done during the day,"" Morgan Hill resident, Manuel Orozco said. ""It made me a little skeptical, wondering okay... that's what we're paying $500 million for."" According to Matt Keller with Valley Water, the latest project estimate puts the cost at $563 million. Keller explained a parcel tax, approved by voters in 2012 will cover $65 million, and much of the money will come from increased water rates. The fear in all of this is that a powerful earthquake could damage the dam, and send a wall of water into surrounding communities. While Valley Water publicly agreed with the need to move quickly, it shared concern about unsafe consequences. Camacho's statement included, ""With the draining of the reservoir, experts would expect fish die-offs. The inability to keep a consistent flow in Coyote Creek downstream of the dam year-round would significantly impact sensitive native fish, amphibians, reptiles, wetlands, and riparian habitats. Water quality could also be significantly impacted downstream of the dam.""  Morgan Hill resident Suzy Buck told ABC7 News, ""I know it won't be forever. I know it'll just be for a little while until they remedy the situation. But until then, I think wildlife has a way of surviving no matter what."" Valley Water's top concern is potential damage to the intake structure. According to Camacho, this would leave the district without any control over water flowing out of the reservoir. Ultimately, impacting communities downstream. The potential areas of impact include parts of San Jose which were inundated in the historic floods of February 2017. Back then, water from the Anderson Reservoir flowed over the banks of Coyote Creek and into several communities. ""It affected a lot of people that were living near the creeks,"" San Jose resident, Habibullah Norzaie said. ""And personally, because I'm a student at San Jose State, I saw lots of flooding along the roads and the streets."" Camacho's statement explained, ""Anderson Reservoir is currently operating below the current levels required by FERC and the state Division of Safety of Dams."" ""A priority will be to design and build a large outlet pipe, which will provide greater control over the water levels and increase public safety,"" she continued. Camacho said Valley Water staff is already exploring other sources of water that will have to come from outside of the county. ""While residents have done an excellent job of conserving water since 2013, another drought during this timeframe could require everyone to significantly decrease their water use,"" Camacho warned. A bill has been introduced in the California Legislature to help expedite the regulatory process and move the project along as quickly as possible.

Both Springfield's Convoy of Hope and the American Red Cross have staffed the hardest hit areas after the earthquake. The large earthquake on January 7, and many smaller ones have caused a lot of damage, especially in the southwest part of Puerto Rico. Springfield resident Nixie Sorrells was there in late December when the first of the earthquakes hit. ""We felt the first one, and then after that were aftershocks, but it was not strong,"" Sorrells says. She's lived in Puerto Rico all her life, until moving to Springfield last year. On January 7th, she was back in Springfield. ""It was kind of feeling guilty, because we were here and they were there,"" Sorrells says. Her family's homes are ok, but she has friends who have lost their homes and knows many people who still fear another big earthquake. ""They put the mattress and everything outside the houses to sleep there, because they were afraid of the ceiling coming down and killing them,"" Sorrells says. Convoy of Hope staff and volunteers have been in Puerto Rico since a few days after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. They originally distributed supplies like food and water. Sorrells says, ""We were like without power for more than 3 months and without water for almost the same."" Convoy of Hope transitioned about a year-and-a-half ago to rebuilding. They've adopted a couple of communities that were hit hard by the hurricane and are helping rebuild homes.  Because they already have a presence in Puerto Rico, they were able to quickly respond to the earthquakes and continue to provide for the needs of people in both disasters. Just recently, the board decided to make the US territory one of its permanent locations. ""What it means now is we are able to direct more resources there, we're able to make longer-term plans. Rather than say, hey will keep helping till the money runs out, now we can say, we are budgeting this on an ongoing basis, so we are going to continue to provide help,"" said Jeff Nene, national spokesman for Convoy of Hope. Some of the supplies they're providing now include blankets, hygiene items, solar lanterns and tents.","More than a month after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck Puerto Rico, volunteers and staff from Springfield are still assisting victims.

Please enter a search term.       WICHITA FALLS (KFDX/KJTL) — This weekend marks exactly 10 years since an incredible group of doctors and nurses from North Texas left for Haiti along with local spiritual healers with the goal to bring at least some relief to victims of the Jan. 12, 2010 catastrophic 7.0 earthquake. People there were desperate for help, and KFDX’s very own Darrell Franklin was fortunate enough to see for himself and report back to Texomans on how the North Texas Medical Mission tried to help as many of those victims as possible in a short period of time. A decade later, he talked with some of those members of the relief team about this mission they will never forget. By the time the North Texas Medical Mission arrived on the earthquake-ravaged island in late February 2010, the Haitian government was estimating a death toll of 230,000 people. Dr. Jerry Myers left a week ahead of the group to try to work out logistics, and there were problems from the beginning. “The night before we were flying the group in, we didn’t know if the airport was going to open,” Myers said. “I knew we could not come across the border because they would confiscate everything we were bringing in. We kind of bribed our way through the airport”  Several members of the mission team were shocked by the devastation that surrounded them. “One of the things that first impressed me on that first day was driving through all the ruins and then coming upon what we call shantytowns or tent cities, which literally you could smell before you saw them,” Dr. Robert McBroom said. “We’d pass by. They had a whole line of porta-potties outside the tent cities. Every one of them was flooding over into the gutters.  One of McBroom’s first patients was a child. “I had to rely on interpreters to try to get at what he was complaining of,” McBroom said. “Mostly it was dehydration and diarrhea. That little kid was drinking out of the gutter.” McBroom said the little boy was drinking where wild hogs, chickens and livestock were. “Not to mention their own excreta,” McBroom recalled. “We were in a situation where there’s still bodies beneath the rubble,” Myers said. “When we went to Port au Prince and when we went through there, there were people just walking around the rubble, knowing that their family’s still in there and even in the area we were at. There were still people in the rubble. They hadn’t gotten out bodies. It was a very difficult situation.”  Another member on the team, Dr. Dan Bolin, said one of his first patients he attended to was a little girl a few days old who he took to a Red Cross tent. “I’m not a pediatrician, but I saw this little girl,” Bolin said. “Of course, I knew she was gonna die if we didn’t… The baby was 9-days-old and under, probably had a low birth weight, probably was premature, dehydrated, lethargic. That is one of the most, you know, distinct memories I have. I hope that little girl survived.”   Some of the people they spoke with recalled the terrifying moments during the earthquake when the ground was shaking. How the houses fell and how people were under rubble for days on end. The team would examine or treat up to 600 people a day, and one reason there were such long lines seeking help could have been because Pastor Kile Bateman was part of the team. “Before I knew it, I had a microphone in my hand, and I got to speak some Creole, get everybody all excited,” Bateman said. “Then they said, ‘tell them why you’re here,’ so we shared that we have a medical team here. I didn’t know exactly how to tell them about the location, but they interpreted that. And that’s how a lot of people heard that there were going to be doctors, nurses, healers that were going to be coming, so they began to spread the word.”  Pastor Patti Bateman said she remembers what he said to children during that time. “Well, mostly I would just use whatever Creole I have and know,” Bateman said. “Some of that is crazy songs and singing. Jesus loves the little children in Creole and our kids are both adopted from Haiti. We love Haiti. We love people. We love the country. We love the culture.”  From being in the streets to interacting with the residents, Bolin said the impact made during that time will be in his heart and mind forever. “I got the feeling they don’t laugh a lot there, but they laughed at some of us and some of the things you did,” Bolin said. “I think that was as much of a gift as anything is for them to laugh and show a positive spirit.” The devastation and medial issues the team witnessed were heartbreaking they said. “There was a lot of infection, a lot of abscesses, and obviously from injuries that weren’t taken care of from broken bones that were set,” Bolin said. “We had to regroup with those things. But these people have no medical care. I mean, I saw a lady with a blood pressure of 225 over I don’t know what. You know, we saw breast cancer in a 30-year-old, thyroid diseases that I didn’t even see in medical school.”  Lung infection. Pneumonia. Untreated asthma. Sickness from drinking soiled water. These doctors remember it all. For a week, this team hurt right along with their patients, but what would hurt the most was not knowing if their patients would get care and survive once they left the ravaged island.  “You took a terrible infrastructure and made it worse,” Myers said. “You kind of left realizing that it’s not going to get much better, but you feel like you’ve at least made a mark there.”  The energy and effort put in during that trip continuously play on their desire to serve. “What matters is that we make the effort,” McBroom said. “If we could give anybody five minutes of comfort with the type of services that we provided that week, then we will have accomplished our mission.”  “This is probably the last time we’re going to be together. This has been an incredible thing,” Bateman said in 2010.  It was indeed an incredible thing, Pastor Kile Bateman said. “They worked from early, early morning to when the sun went down,” Bateman said. “Hardly any breaks. Maybe a little bit of water or something to eat.”   Though it was tough and heartbreaking, those team members don’t regret a second of it. “I’ll have to say this was the best day in medicine I’ve ever had,” Dr. Tim McCleland said in 2010. “This has been an incredible thing,” Bateman said. “The only way you’re going to know what all you’ve done here is probably when you get to heaven and you get to see the impact you made here.”  It was an incredible mission accomplished where a North Texas medical and spiritual mission brought healing to Haiti.

In all, over a dozen schools needed major repairs. Two schools in Eagle River, Gruening Middle School and Eagle River Elementary, were knocked offline and deemed unsafe. Two years later, on the anniversary of the earthquake, the two schools remain offline but their path to reopening looks bright. “Gruening is coming really good,” ASD Project Manager for Gruening Middle School Yuki Janson said. “Lots of cleaning and lots of surprises here and there but we’ve got really good contractors.” With the help of voters passing a school bond last April, the Anchorage School District quickly got to work this summer with the ambitious goal to have the school renovated and rebuilt by the fall of 2021. “It’s an 80s building,” Janson said. “So you can’t trust everything you see. You gotta get inside and look.” Despite a few snags within the old building and a delay in shipping of materials from the Lower 48 due to COVID-19, both schools are on track to open on time. “We’re pretty much on schedule,” ASD Project Manager for Eagle River Elementary Nick Bell said. “We’ve had delays in materials but the contractor is reworking their schedule in phasing in order to rework those delays and we are moving ahead. Making good progress.” “I would call it a repair and renovation,” ASD Senior Director of Capital Planning and Construction Tom Fenoseff said. “We’re repairing the structural issues, we’re making them safer and we’re adding some improvements to the schools like secure vestibules and improved security.” While the schools will still have some of their old features, they will also have the new school feel and look with technology, safety and structure upgrades. Eagle River Elementary is scheduled for completion in July 2021 and Gruening Middle School in early August 2021, both ready in time for the new school year. Copyright 2020 KTUU.

1480,Video: Anderson Reservoir is drained as part of earthquake project to rebuild 240-foot Anderson Dam,2020-12-16 14:00 UTC,https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/12/16/video-anderson-reservoir-is-drained-as-part-of-earthquake-project-to-rebuild-240-foot-anderson-dam/,"Today's e-Edition Get Morning Report and other email newsletters  Get Morning Report and other email newsletters Today's e-Edition  Anderson Reservoir, the largest in Santa Clara County, is nearly empty. The Santa Clara Valley Water District, which owns the reservoir located east of Highway 101 between Morgan Hill and San Jose, said Tuesday that its crews have finished draining nearly all of its water — leaving it just 3% full — as part of a historic, $576 million earthquake repair job.  Draining began Oct. 1. Construction workers can now begin a 10-year seismic safety project to rebuild Anderson’s 240-foot earthen dam, which was built in 1950. The reservoir will remain nearly empty until 2024, water district officials said, while a 1,700-foot-long tunnel, up to 24 feet in diameter, is built on the north side of the dam. It is expected to increase by five-fold the rate at which water can be released during major storms or after an earthquake that could damage the dam. After that, the rest of the water will be drained out for six years, until about 2030 or 2031, while the dam is rebuilt to more modern standards. During that time, most of Anderson Lake County Park will be closed. Seismic problems at the dam were first identified 12 years ago. But the district’s delays in beginning the repair work prompted the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in February to order the reservoir drained. For the past three months, the massive lake was drained at the rate of about 200 acre feet, or 65 million gallons a day — the equivalent of 98 Olympic swimming pools every 24 hours. The water wasn’t wasted, however. Most of it went to drinking water treatment plants, and was served to the public, while some was percolated back into underground aquifers for storage, and some was released into Coyote Creek for fish. Federal regulators criticized the water district for taking so long to undertake the project. The agency first learned of the seismic problems in 2009, and subsequently released engineering studies showing that a 6.6 magnitude quake on the Calaveras Fault directly at Anderson Reservoir, or a 7.2 quake centered one mile away, could cause the reservoir’s huge earthen dam to slump and fail. Although the chances of that are extremely slim, if such a disaster had occurred when the reservoir was full, it could have sent a 35-foot wall of water into downtown Morgan Hill in 14 minutes. The waters would have been 8-feet deep in San Jose in three hours, potentially killing thousands of people. Ironically, on Tuesday morning, two earthquakes occurred 1 mile east of Anderson Reservoir on the Calaveras Fault — a magnitude 3.7 and 3.5. No damage was reported. Some local residents wondered whether the draining of the reservoir, which had been 18% full on Oct. 1, caused the earthquakes by shifting the amount of weight on the nearby fault. No, said federal geologists. Related Articles

“The recent earthquakes occurred along a known fault patch that typically has several similarly sized, naturally occurring earthquakes per year,” said Rob Skoumal, a research geophysicist, with the USGS Earthquake Science Center at Moffett Field. When full, Anderson Reservoir holds 89,278 acre feet of water — more than all other nine dams operated by the Santa Clara Valley Water District combined. The district, which serves 2 million people, will make up for the lost water during construction by pumping more local groundwater, using recycled water, and importing water from the Delta and from the Semitropic Water Storage District in Kern County, where it has been storing water underground for years.

         Guánica, Puerto Rico — A 5.8-magnitude quake hit Puerto Rico before dawn Monday, unleashing small landslides, causing power outages and severely cracking some homes. It was one of the strongest quakes yet to hit the U.S. territory that has been shaking for the past week. There were no immediate reports of casualties but there was significant damage in the town of Guánica. An Associated Press photographer captured an image of at least two vehicles crushed by a house that collapsed in the earthquake.   Residents took to social media to report the ""strong temblor.""  Triste despertar para familia que acaba de perder su casa a causa de el fuerte sismo que ocurrió hoy en el sur de Puerto Rico. Gracias a Dios estas personas y sus hijos están bien. pic.twitter.com/REcucvTuYY Power outages were reported in some parts of Puerto Rico following the quake, Angel Vazquez, emergency management director for the southern coastal city of Ponce, told The Associated Press. ""This is one of the strongest quakes to date since it started shaking on Dec. 28,"" he said. ""It lasted a long time."" Helicopters buzzed overhead as terrified residents jumped up from their folding chairs every time the earth shook, yelling at others to stay away from power lines. Few people dared go back inside their homes, but José Quiñones, 54, had no choice. His 80-year-old mother had heart problems and was lying in bed. Dozens of people in a neighborhood called Hope in the southwest town of Guánica walked around with their phones and yelled out the magnitude of the latest earthquakes as they tried to calm children who were forced to open their presents on Three Kings Day, a religious holiday, on streets and sidewalks. ""This is hell,"" said Alberto Rodríguez, 43, whose home collapsed on its side as the smell of gas filled the air. ""We haven't slept... you can't remain calm here. Guánica is no longer a safe place."" Less than a block away, Silvestre Alicea surveyed his home whose foundation collapsed on his bright blue 1977 Toyota Corolla, a prized possession. He jumped from his balcony as the home collapsed. Alicea had lived in New York for years until he retired to Guánica two years ago to live in the home he spent 15 years building. He doesn't have insurance. In this working class neighborhood, people shared soda and snacks as they sought shelter from a harsh sun, careful to stay away from homes whose columns and foundations were heavily cracked. At a hotel in the southwest coastal town of Guanica, people panicked as they tried to flee in their cars, only to realize that large boulders were obstructing the only highway heading north to the capital of San Juan, attorney Jose Francisco Benitez told the AP. ""There was a state of panic,"" he said. ""There were even people in their underwear walking around the hotel."" Many already had bags packed in their cars with a change of clothes, food, water and medicine.  Some like Noelia De Jesús, 69, and her husband, who uses a wheelchair, didn't know where they would spend the night. Government officials who inspected their home earlier in the morning said it was unsafe to live in and advised them to stay elsewhere. ""Everything broke, including the TV,"" she said. ""This is horrible."" Puerto Rico doesn't have a public earthquake warning system, except for sirens that are supposed to ring in case of a tsunami. Residents in this neighborhood criticized the government for what they believe is a lack of action. Dr. Sindia Alvarado, who lives in the southern coastal town of Penuelas, said she was petrified. ""My entire family woke up screaming,"" she said. ""I though the house was going to crack in half."" The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico's southern region began the night of Dec. 28, with quakes ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to 5.1. Previous quakes of lesser magnitudes in recent days have cracked homes and led to goods falling off supermarket shelves.  One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a 7.3-magnitude quake struck near the island's northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.

         An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 rocked eastern Turkey on Friday, killing at least 18 people and causing some buildings to collapse. The quake injured more than 500 and left approximately 30 trapped in toppled buildings, Turkish officials said.  Elazig is some 465 miles east of the capital, Ankara. Governor Cetin Oktay Kaldirim told NTV television that three people died in the province. State-run Anadolu Agency quoted Governor Aydin Barus as saying five other people died in his nearby Malatya province. At least 225 people were injured in Elazig and 90 in Malatya. Kaldirim said a fire broke out in a building in Sivrice but was quickly brought under control. People in Elazig whose homes were damaged or were too afraid to go indoors were being moved to student dormitories or sports center amid freezing conditions. Earlier, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told NTV television that rescuers were trying to reach survivors after a four- or five-story building collapsed in the town of Maden, in Elazig. Approximately 4-5 buildings collapsed in Sivrice, where two people were hurt, he said. Local administrator Cuma Telceken said up to seven people are believed to be trapped inside two collapsed buildings in Maden. Television footage showed rescuers searching for survivors among debris. Rescue teams from neighboring provinces were dispatched to the affected areas, Anadolu Agency reported. Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said troops were on standby to help if needed. The Kandilli seismology center in Istanbul said the quake measured 6.5., while the U.S. Geological Survey gave the preliminary magnitude as 6.7, and said the quake affected not only Turkey but also Syria, Georgia and Armenia. Different earthquake monitoring centers frequently give differing estimates. Turkey sits on top of two major fault-lines and earthquakes are frequent.

Please enter a search term.       SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A magnitude 5.9 quake shook Puerto Rico on Saturday, causing further damage along the island’s southern coast, where previous recent quakes have toppled homes and schools.  Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority said outages were reported across much of southern Puerto Rico and crews were assessing possible damage at power plants. Bárbara Cruz, a prosecutor who was in the southern coastal city of Ponce when the new quake hit, said concrete debris hit the sidewalk as buildings continued to crumble. “Everyone is out on the street,” she said. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The quake, which initially had been calculated at magnitude 6.0, was the strongest shake yet since a magnitude 6.4 quake — the strongest to hit the island in a century — struck before dawn on Tuesday, knocking out power across Puerto Rico and leaving many without water. More than 2,000 people remain in shelters, many fearful of returning to their homes, and others unable to because of extensive damage. Hundreds of quakes have shaken the island since the new year, though most were too slight to be felt. NASA reported Friday that the quakes had moved the land in parts of southern Puerto Rico as much as 5.5 inches (14 centimeters), based on satellite images before and after the temblors. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, told The Associated Press that he expects still more aftershocks as a result of the latest large one. “It’s going to re-energize an unstable situation,” he said, adding that seismologists are studying which faults were activated. “It’s a complex zone.” Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans are still without power and water, and thousands are staying in shelters and sleeping on sidewalks since Tuesday’s earthquake. That temblor killed one person, injured nine others and damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and several schools and businesses in the island’s southwest region.

(Photo by Ricardo ARDUENGO / AFP) (Photo by RICARDO ARDUENGO/AFP via Getty Images) The strongest in a series of earthquakes reaching back weeks jolted Puerto Rico Tuesday morning. Measuring a magnitude 6.4 on the Richter scale, the tremor damaged homes and businesses, knocked out power to a significant portion of the island and killed at least one person. The temblor comes just a day after a 5.8 quake Monday that caused the collapse of the popular natural rock formation Punta Ventana or Window Point. Tuesday’s stronger quake destroyed the Immaculate Conception church in the community of Guayanilla, a local landmark and tourist attraction originally built in 1841.  “The preliminary location of this earthquake is within about 12 km of the January 6, 2020, M 5.8 earthquake,” the US Geological Survey wrote in a report. “Over the past several weeks, hundreds of small earthquakes have occurred in this same region, beginning in earnest with a M 4.7 earthquake late on December 28 and a M 5.0 event a few hours later.” The USGS warns that more aftershocks should be expected. On Monday after the magnitude 5.8 quake, the office had advised that there was about a four percent chance of a stronger earthquake striking. Following Tuesday’s 6.4 magnitude tremor, the USGS now says there is a nine percent chance of an even stronger quake over the next week. Notably, though, the forecast for aftershocks stronger than magnitude 5.0 is 90 percent. Debris from a collapsed wall of a building litters the ground after an earthquake struck Puerto Rico ... [+] before dawn, in Ponce, Puerto Rico, Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020. (AP Photo/Carlos Giusti) Tuesday’s quake generated far more widespread damage than the less intense tremors over the past two weeks, which is bad news for an island still struggling to recover from a pair of hurricanes in 2017 that led to widespread flooding and destruction across the US territory. The earthquake is expected to be the most damaging on the island in a century. On Tuesday morning, Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced signed a state of emergency declaration, activating the National Guard. Puerto Rico is vulnerable to seismic activity thanks to being squeezed between two tectonic plates. The North America plate subducts beneath the Caribbean plate along the Puerto Rico trench on the north side of the island. To the south, the Caribbean plate’s crust slides beneath Puerto Rico. The recent earthquakes have all been shallow, but seismic activity in the area does come with a risk of tsunamis, and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that small tsunami waves of less than a foot were observed.

Elsewhere in Santa Isabel, on the island’s southern coast, other family members are without power, relying on spotty WiFi connections for information on social media. “People are confused,” said Reyes-Morton, who has aunts, cousins, grandparents, and other relatives living within 25 miles of where the 6.4 magnitude quake hit. “It’s hard for the government to communicate at a time like this, with no electricity and damaged roads. There is fear and a lot of uncertainty.” As natural disasters have pummeled Puerto Rico, many have fled the island for Philadelphia, drawn by its relatively low cost of living and thriving Puerto Rican community. There were about 134,000 Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia as of 2017, nearly 50% more than two decades earlier. An additional 23,000 live in Camden, about a third of the city’s population.  Gladys Carrión, a middle school teacher at Julia de Burgos School in Philadelphia’s Fairhill section, has two adult sons living in Yabucoa, on the island’s east coast. When she spoke with them a few hours after the quake on Tuesday, both said they were fine and urged her to keep calm. She’s still worried after aftershocks and other ripple effects. “I feel helpless with this situation, after all we’ve been through,” she said. Philadelphia City Councilmember Maria Quiñones-Sánchez, who was born in Puerto Rico, had been planning a trip there this week to visit family. Her relatives are safe, she said. Meanwhile, she and others are starting to plan how to help with relief efforts. After Hurricane Maria in 2017, the local Latin American community joined with other groups like churches and synagogues to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, she said. “So many infrastructure problems still remain from past disasters,” she said. “The electric grid is still very fragile. A lot of things have been normalized; it’s not unusual to lose power or water. People are more nonchalant about it. That becomes oppressive day after day. It’s very sad.” Vanessa Colón Almenas, a reporter for Puerto Rico’s Centro de Periodismo Investigativo (Center for Investigative Journalism), said that island residents were waiting in long lines for gas, as they did after Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and that the ground had been shaking off and on for the last week and a half, leading many to fear that more quakes could be ahead.  Eight people were injured in Ponce, Mayor Mayita Meléndez told WAPA television, and police confirmed that 73-year-old Nelson Martínez Guillén had died in the quake. Power went out on the island as plants shut down to protect themselves, with two suffering minor damage. Water systems were also shut down, buildings collapsed, and major highways caved in. Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced issued an executive order Tuesday to activate the National Guard, stating that “the earthquake caused even more significant damage to critical infrastructure, life and property, including roads, bridges, schools, homes and other related damages.” This story contains information from the Associated Press.","Philadelphia Councilmember Maria Quiñones-Sánchez, who was born in Puerto Rico, is joining with others starting to plan relief efforts.

Puerto Rico is still reeling from a pair of destructive earthquakes that occurred over the last two days. Much of Puerto Rico is still without power as engineers work to restore it in phases. Terrified of sleeping indoors as aftershocks continue, some people put mattresses in their front yards while others spent the night under white tents and tarps.  The biggest of the two quakes was a 6.4 magnitude, and is one of the largest felt there in a century. It left homes destroyed, displaced hundreds of people and recovery could be more than $3 billion. The earthquakes come after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in September 2017.  Some people in southern Puerto Rico said the earthquakes' damage was worse. Overnight, President Donald Trump approved FEMA assistance for the island. The effects of the earthquakes are also being felt in Central Florida. WESH 2 News spoke with people who have family and friends on the island.""It's very hard for the family down here to see what's going on in Puerto Rico. Everybody's scared. Nobody's sleeping. It's very hard,” Marangely Lopez said. At Melao Bakery in Orlando, a popular Puerto Rican restaurant, many people have their minds on their family and friends now suffering again without power and other basic resources. ""Every time I call my mom and she cries, she's just hysterical. She's scared,” Lopez said. Lopez lives in Puerto Rico and came to Florida to visit her children to ring in the new year. With her mother and two of her kids on the island, she's planning to go back as soon as she can. ""It's very hard. It's just hard, because we want to be there, but we can't. And they're going through a lot,” Lopez said. ""It's really devastating,” said Johnattan Lozado, who moved to Orlando from Puerto Rico six years ago and still has lots of family and friends there. “Because we just had like, the disaster with Hurricane Maria, the island is still recovering. I still knew people that still didn't have electricity. With these earthquakes, that just adds a layer of difficulty to like, get everybody back to speed,” Lozado said. Some people say the earthquakes and the threat of more make this even worse than Maria.""It's horrible because when a hurricane is coming, they'll let you know, and you know how to prepare and what to do, but an earthquake, it's not the same thing,” Lopez said.

1831,"After another Puerto Rico earthquake, the U.S. keeps ignoring 3 million Americans | Opinion",2020-01-29 14:30 UTC,https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/puerto-rico-earthquake-aid-us-territory-20200129.html,"For all that they give to our country, the Americans of Puerto Rico are so often ignored because they reside in a territory, not a state. Millions of Americans are being systematically forgotten and mistreated by our government and its leaders on a bipartisan and daily basis, lost and left behind in the latest political controversy or policy squabble. Imagine if, God forbid, the state of Iowa was hit with two Category 5 storms in the span of a few weeks that would destroy essential infrastructure, cause billions of dollars in damages, and lead to an estimated 3,000 casualties within a year. Imagine just over two years later, while Iowa is still struggling to recover from those storms and facing a multi-year humanitarian crisis, the state gets jolted by a series of earthquakes, leaving thousands without homes, electricity, and drinking water. Imagine the current Republican administration delaying, then restricting, billions of dollars in lifesaving aid to Iowa, and the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination never mentioning the state during a two-hour nationally televised debate. One would have to imagine these scenarios because this would never actually happen to the great state of Iowa — and its population of three million people, six electoral votes, and its first-in-the-nation caucuses. It would be presidential political malfeasance to forget about Iowa, especially in a presidential election year. Iowa’s two senators and four House representatives would never allow for this to happen. Our social media and 24/7 news environment would hold our national leaders accountable and just as assuredly never allow this to happen. This should never happen in 2020. Yet it is happening right now to over three million Americans in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico’s population is roughly the same as that of Iowa. After suffering through two catastrophic hurricanes in 2017 that caused great destruction, Puerto Rico has recently faced an onslaught of earthquakes that further damaged an already devastated island.  The Trump administration recently released a much-delayed and much-needed $16 billion of disaster relief and prevention aid package to Puerto Rico. However, the money came with a number of restrictions, including a bar from any amount being spent on the electric grid, despite years of rolling blackouts on the island. The funds were released after much public outcry and a series of earthquakes that crippled the island’s already damaged infrastructure. On the other side of the aisle, the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination recently held a nationally televised debate, where over the course of two hours and the discussion of numerous topics, the plight of Puerto Rico was never mentioned once. This is not to suggest that both sides of the political spectrum bear equal blame for inattention and inaction toward Puerto Rico at the national level. Rather, this is to suggest that too often, Puerto Rico is readily forgotten by our national leaders on a bipartisan basis. Puerto Rican Americans serve our country in all levels of government. They are civil servants and enlisted soldiers, congressional representatives and Senate staffers, assistant U.S. attorneys and a United States Supreme Court Justice. Yet for all that they give and sacrifice for our country, the Americans of Puerto Rico are so often ignored because they reside in a territory, not a state. American territories like Puerto Rico possess a second-rate political status relative to states. Puerto Rico does not have any U.S. senators, voting House representatives, or electors in the Electoral College, despite being more populated than 21 states. They are subject to American laws and regulations with little to no say over them. They fight and die on behalf of our country, but have no right to vote for their commander in chief. Our national leaders can do better by Puerto Rico and its people. We can remember them, account for them, and protect them like we do Iowans, Pennsylvanians, Californians, Floridians, and the citizens of all our states through our politics and policies. We can start by publicly acknowledging the serious problems facing Puerto Rico on the floors of power in Washington, D.C., as well as on the floor of a national debate stage. The Democratic Party should hold a debate or forum for its leading presidential candidates on the island to bring national attention to the issues facing Puerto Rico. We can and should provide much-needed funding, expertise, and other governmental support as quickly as possible to the island as we would if a humanitarian crisis was occurring in any of our 50 states. We can and should do better by the people of Puerto Rico, if for no other reason than the simple fact that they are our fellow Americans. And lest we need a cold political reason for doing better, we should remember that over a million former residents of Puerto Rico now live in Florida, a state with 29 votes in the Electoral College. Tom C.W. Lin is a professor of law at Temple University’s Beasley School of Law and the author of a recent California Law Review study on the plight of Puerto Rico and the other American territories.","For all that they give to our country, the Americans of Puerto Rico are so often ignored because they reside in a territory, not a state.

         A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck south of Cuba and northwest of Jamaica, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It was centered about 76 miles north-northwest of Lucea, Jamaica, CBS Miami reported. There were no initial reports of damage or casualties. The quake was centered about 6 miles beneath the surface of the water. The National Weather Service initially issued a tsunami threat for the coasts of Jamaica, Belize, Cuba, Honduras, Mexico and the Cayman Islands, but called off the alert around 4 p.m. ET. There was concern there could be tsunami waves reaching about 1 to 3 feet above the tide level. The quake was so powerful some Miami residents felt their buildings shake. ""I was sitting at my desk in Aventura, I felt motion similar to feeling light-headed,"" a resident who asked to remain anonymous told CBS Miami. ""It didn't stop and my coworker asked if the building was moving."" A CBS Miami chopper flew over buildings as hundreds of people were apparently evacuating into the streets.   The Stephen P. Clark building in downtown Miami has also been closed as a precaution, police said. They said some buildings in the Brickell area were evacuated, but there were no reported injuries and there are no road closures. Raquel Perez, an employee at the Don Soffer Clinical Research Center on the University of Miami Medical Campus was on the seventh floor when she felt the quake. ""Not everyone noticed it in my office. I was sitting at my desk and felt my chair swaying. Then, I noticed the cords of our window blinds swaying back and forth. It didn't look like it was windy outside, so I couldn't figure out why the building was swaying, but it was,"" Perez told CBS Miami. ""It actually made me a little dizzy. Ten minutes later, someone in our office said they also felt movement and found a report online of an earthquake,"" she added.    Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

1835,Earthquake-damaged buildings cripple Puerto Rico,2020-01-17 05:13 UTC,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/16/us/puerto-rico-earthquake-damaged-buildings/index.html,"
      The Ponciana Condominium building here is one of the most distinctive in the island’s second-largest city. It’s a 12-story structure, just south of downtown, with medical and commercial units on its first three floors and residential units on the remaining nine.
   
      But after a series of tremors and aftershocks that have rattled Puerto Rico’s southern coast since December 28, the tower now sits empty. 
   
      Ponce authorities declared it uninhabitable shortly after a mandatory evacuation prompted by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake left cracks and fissures on three sides of the building. Ivette Campos says her elderly aunt was one of those residents who were quickly evacuated.
   
      “They kicked all the residents out as well as people in the doctors’ offices, and nobody truly knows what’s going to happen with the building,” Campos said.
   
      Mayor María E. Meléndez said that there are areas in Ponce that “were severely affected and we estimate the damage to be above $200 million, in addition to the losses sustained by businesses that have had to shut their doors.”
   
      The Ponciana is one of 23 condominium buildings in Ponce that have sustained structural damage, according to Ángel Vázquez Torres, the local emergency management agency’s director.
   
      Vázquez told CNN the same happened with an additional 404 houses in the city.
    
      The fear is that if there’s another major earthquake, some of these structures may collapse, trapping residents or worse.
   
      “Our structural engineers evaluated those sites and indicated to us which ones we had to declare uninhabitable, and we’re trying to keep people away from them,” Vázquez told CNN.
   
      Authorities say there also are countless buildings and houses that may have sustained damage that is not visible during the nearly three weeks of daily tremors and aftershocks that have happened in Ponce and towns located on the island’s southern coast.
    
      The work of detecting the damage in Ponce, Guánica, Guayanilla and Yauco is only beginning.
   
      It’s another great challenge for Puerto Rico, a US territory that has yet to recover from the devastating effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which killed nearly 3,000 in September 2017.
   
      Buildings that had been damaged by the hurricanes simply collapsed or were left in worse shape by the earthquakes and aftershocks. The same happened to other infrastructure, such as roads and bridges.
   
      Deciding what to do next with damaged buildings is still an open question for Puerto Rico. Repairs will be costly and demolishing houses and buildings declared uninhabitable will also cost millions of dollars.
   
      After days of waiting, the island got some good news about funding to begin the recovery process. President Donald Trump on Thursday afternoon approved a declaration of a major disaster in Puerto Rico.
   
      The declaration provides federal funding for six municipalities on the southern coast.
   
      Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced expressed gratitude. “We thank the @POTUS for his commitment helping relieve the suffering of our fellow citizens.”
   
      Alex Amparo, the top official in the region for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), describes the challenge Puerto Rico now faces in military terms.
   
      “We’re in a constant battle, I mean, we’re in a fight right now.  The ground is still shaking. I think you saw earlier we had a 5.2 and at the same time we have people who have lost homes,” Amparo said.
   
      While the full extent of the damage continues to be assessed, authorities have to take care of more pressing needs. 
   
      There are currently 30 shelters on Puerto Rico’s southern coast, holding 8,023 people who were affected by the earthquakes.
   
      Shelters in the cities of Yauco, Peñuelas, Guánica, Guayanilla and Ponce provide food, showers, air-conditioned rest areas, psychological counseling and medical services.
   
      Some of those displaced are residents who are too afraid to return home for fear a wall or the roof will collapse.
   
      But many others are families whose homes are now in ruins, people who are wondering whether they will receive housing assistance from the government or whether they will have to fend for themselves.
   
      Luis Vélez told CNN that he and his extended family of more than 20 people, including a disabled uncle, have been living at a shelter opened by local authorities at Ponce Vocational School. 
   
      “We’re going to stay here until the ground stops shaking,” Vélez said. “We got back on our feet after Hurricane María and, with God’s help, we will do the same after this series of earthquakes is over.”

But, Lopez said falling rocks were tumbling from mountainsides onto Puerto Rico’s main highway. “It’s terrifying,” he said. Along the way, he passed houses and cars that sustained a lot of damage. Fortunately, his relatives’ house was not significantly damaged.   Now that he’s back safe in Waterbury, he sees himself getting involved in a possible effort to help the people of Puerto Rico recover from yet another blow from Mother Nature. “We’re going to try to do what we can to do our part,” he said.

         Guánica, Puerto Rico — A 5.8-magnitude quake hit Puerto Rico before dawn Monday, unleashing small landslides, causing power outages and severely cracking some homes. It was one of the strongest quakes yet to hit the U.S. territory that has been shaking for the past week. There were no immediate reports of casualties but there was significant damage in the town of Guánica. An Associated Press photographer captured an image of at least two vehicles crushed by a house that collapsed in the earthquake.   Residents took to social media to report the ""strong temblor.""  Triste despertar para familia que acaba de perder su casa a causa de el fuerte sismo que ocurrió hoy en el sur de Puerto Rico. Gracias a Dios estas personas y sus hijos están bien. pic.twitter.com/REcucvTuYY Power outages were reported in some parts of Puerto Rico following the quake, Angel Vazquez, emergency management director for the southern coastal city of Ponce, told The Associated Press. ""This is one of the strongest quakes to date since it started shaking on Dec. 28,"" he said. ""It lasted a long time."" Helicopters buzzed overhead as terrified residents jumped up from their folding chairs every time the earth shook, yelling at others to stay away from power lines. Few people dared go back inside their homes, but José Quiñones, 54, had no choice. His 80-year-old mother had heart problems and was lying in bed. Dozens of people in a neighborhood called Hope in the southwest town of Guánica walked around with their phones and yelled out the magnitude of the latest earthquakes as they tried to calm children who were forced to open their presents on Three Kings Day, a religious holiday, on streets and sidewalks. ""This is hell,"" said Alberto Rodríguez, 43, whose home collapsed on its side as the smell of gas filled the air. ""We haven't slept... you can't remain calm here. Guánica is no longer a safe place."" Less than a block away, Silvestre Alicea surveyed his home whose foundation collapsed on his bright blue 1977 Toyota Corolla, a prized possession. He jumped from his balcony as the home collapsed. Alicea had lived in New York for years until he retired to Guánica two years ago to live in the home he spent 15 years building. He doesn't have insurance. In this working class neighborhood, people shared soda and snacks as they sought shelter from a harsh sun, careful to stay away from homes whose columns and foundations were heavily cracked. At a hotel in the southwest coastal town of Guanica, people panicked as they tried to flee in their cars, only to realize that large boulders were obstructing the only highway heading north to the capital of San Juan, attorney Jose Francisco Benitez told the AP. ""There was a state of panic,"" he said. ""There were even people in their underwear walking around the hotel."" Many already had bags packed in their cars with a change of clothes, food, water and medicine.  Some like Noelia De Jesús, 69, and her husband, who uses a wheelchair, didn't know where they would spend the night. Government officials who inspected their home earlier in the morning said it was unsafe to live in and advised them to stay elsewhere. ""Everything broke, including the TV,"" she said. ""This is horrible."" Puerto Rico doesn't have a public earthquake warning system, except for sirens that are supposed to ring in case of a tsunami. Residents in this neighborhood criticized the government for what they believe is a lack of action. Dr. Sindia Alvarado, who lives in the southern coastal town of Penuelas, said she was petrified. ""My entire family woke up screaming,"" she said. ""I though the house was going to crack in half."" The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico's southern region began the night of Dec. 28, with quakes ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to 5.1. Previous quakes of lesser magnitudes in recent days have cracked homes and led to goods falling off supermarket shelves.  One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a 7.3-magnitude quake struck near the island's northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.

 A 6.3-magnitude quake struck the Philippines on Friday, the U.S. Geological Survey said, with residents in the capital, Manila, reporting buildings shaking and Christmas Day Masses interrupted, but there were no reports of damage.  The agency initially said the quake's strength was 6.2 and 108 kilometers deep. In the coastal city of Calatagan, about 90 kilometers south of Manila and near the epicenter, people attending Mass remained calm as the earthquake hit, police chief Major Carlo Caceres told AFP. ""There was a pause in the church service, but the people did not panic,"" Caceres said. ""This area is quake-prone and people are more or less used to them."" There were no reports of damage or casualties in the area, he added. ""The office furniture and equipment swayed, but nothing was broken,"" said policeman Allan Megano in the nearby town of Balayan. The Philippines is situated on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.

1870,16-Foot 'Earthquake Fish' Caught After Quakes Strike Coast of Taiwan,2020-12-04 10:40 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/16-foot-earthquake-fish-caught-after-quakes-strike-coast-of-taiwan_3586728.html,"On the same day that two earthquakes hit the coast of eastern Taiwan, a fisherman caught a humungous oarfish measuring over 16 feet (approx. 5 meters) in length. The species is dubbed “earthquake fish” for its habit of rising from the depths before a quake. The impressive catch was sold to a local seafood restaurant. After reeling in the massive oarfish off the Dong’ao coast of Taiwan’s Yilan County on Nov. 6, the fisherman logged its weight as around 99.2 pounds (approx. 45 kg). Chen Kuo-pin, the owner of Fumei Huo Seafood Restaurant, who purchased the fish for 16,000 New Taiwan dollars (US$566), told Liberty Times it was the longest earthquake fish he had ever seen. Local fishermen attested to his statement. Chen explained that fishermen usually cast their nets between early morning and late evening but speculated that the 16-foot behemoth had likely been caught at nighttime. Deep-sea fish do not survive long in tanks or shallow water; fishermen nonetheless claimed that the oarfish was alive when they docked with their trophy catch. Chen, a restaurateur of 55 years, said oarfish are not uncommon in the area. However, most oarfish measure between 3 and 6.5 feet (approx. 1 and 2 meters) in length. The 16-foot beauty, he claimed, was “very rare.” Posting about the epic catch on Facebook, Fumei Huo Seafood Restaurant staffers announced, “Everyone is welcome to come and take pictures and check in.” The oarfish—scientific name Regalecus glesne—is allegedly the world’s longest bony fish, according to National Geographic. It eats tiny plankton, lacks scales, and is completely harmless to humans. The two earthquakes on Nov. 6 that precipitated the 16-foot Taiwanese oarfish’s rise from the deep sea registered a magnitude of 5.4, according to Central Weather Bureau data. Chen’s customers were reportedly blown away by the size of the restaurateur’s purchase. One kilogram (approx. two pounds) of delicate oarfish meat can sell for up to 400 New Taiwan dollars (US$14), Chen told Liberty Times. The meat, he said, is “more tender than tofu,” and is soft enough to be eaten with a spoon after steaming.

(WCSC) - The city of North Charleston is teaming up with a Charleston woman who grew up in Puerto Rico to help those affected by the earthquakes there. Sharon Doublin, who now lives in Charleston, says her mother was visiting her at Christmas when the earthquakes happened and kept her from returning to Puerto Rico. Since late December, Puerto Rico has experienced multiple earthquakes, the most severe being a 6.4-magnitude on Jan. 7.  Doublin decided she needed to help. She has been in contact with other family still in Puerto Rico, who told her about an organization taking supplies in the south end of the island. It helps people who have been displaced from their homes or whose homes are damaged.  When Mayor Keith Summey heard that Doublin was collecting supplies at her work, Job Impulse, he immediately decided to help out. The city hosted a drive at Cane Bay YMCA Saturday to collect goods for those who have been displaced from their houses in the south end of Puerto Rico. They collected donations big and small from canned goods and child care supplies to tents, sleeping bags, and blankets. “I am super proud of being part of a city that has a heart for the people,"" Doublin says. ""And that genuinely they don’t care where you come from, or what’s your background, or what’s your nationality, they’re here to help.” The City of North Charleston has offered to pay to ship all of the supplies to Puerto Rico. But it is not too late to help. Job Impulse will continue collecting supplies this week from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. through Friday. The business is located off of Park Forest Parkway in North Charleston.

The rest of the 120 animals are being flown to shelters in Massachusetts and New Jersey.  Steffen said the animals had to be removed from their shelters in Puerto Rico because, following a series of earthquakes that have taken a severe toll on the island's infrastructure, the buildings were deemed ""uninhabitable.""  The shelters, Villa Michelle Albergues de Animales and Santuario de San Francisco de Asis, suffer from overcrowding as well as damage. They are among the only amimal rescue centers still open in the hard-hit southern portion of the island, according to Steffen. ""The structure has been damaged in foundation, so walls are cracked, the foundations are cracked,"" Steffen said of one of the shelters. ""It was deemed just unsafe, especially with the amount of aftershocks they're having."" Puerto Rico was rocked by a magnitude 6.4 earthquake on January 7, and then again by another 6.0 quake several days later. The rumbles have caused hardship for residents, knocking out power and leaving many without water.   The animal rescue was a joint effort by Wings of Rescue, which flew the animals out, and Greater Good, which provided funding. In order to give the animals a day to rest, they will be available for adoption at the Humane Society of Broward starting on Martin Luther King Day, according to Steffen.","Of more than a hundred animals who were rescued from destroyed shelters in Puerto Rico, a Broward shelter has taken in over twenty, and they will be up for adoption soon.

1903,Irish Election Produces an Earthquake as Sinn Fein Tops Poll,2020-02-11 07:36 UTC,https://www.theepochtimes.com/irish-election-produces-an-earthquake-as-sinn-fein-tops-poll_3233546.html,"DUBLIN—Ireland braced for weeks of political uncertainty on Feb. 10 after an earth-shaking election that saw the Irish Republican Army-linked party Sinn Fein—long shunned by its bigger rivals—take the largest share of votes. In a surge that upended Ireland’s traditional two-party system, the left-wing nationalist party beat both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, the centrist parties that have governed Ireland since it won independence from Britain a century ago. The vote in Feb. 8 election essentially split three ways, complicating the negotiations on forming a government that lie ahead. Sinn Fein received 24.5 percent of the first-preference votes, besting the two long-dominant parties. Fianna Fail received 22.2 percent of the votes. Fine Gael, the party of incumbent Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, got 20.9 percent. “I think it’s a mess, to be honest with you,” said Pat O’Toole, a public sector worker in Dublin. “I think we’re going to be in a situation again where we are not going to be able to form a stable government in this country. I really don’t know what’s going to happen.” Sinn Fein’s left-wing proposals for tackling Ireland’s housing crisis and creaking health care system proved a powerful draw for young voters in a country that is still dealing with aftershocks of the 2008 global financial crisis, which hammered its debt-driven “Celtic Tiger” economy. Vote counting resumed Feb. 10 to fill all the seats in the 160-seat Dail, the lower house of Ireland’s Parliament. Ireland uses a proportional representation system in which voters rank candidates from first to last, with the lower preferences of elected or defeated candidates redistributed among their rivals. Sinn Fein’s low number of candidates meant, however, that it could fall just short of the largest number of seats when two days of counting nears conclusion later on Feb. 10—likely behind Fianna Fail but potentially above Fine Gael. No party is likely to reach the 80 seats needed for a majority, making some form of coalition inevitable. But forming a stable alliance looks tough. Both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael said before the election that they would not go into a coalition with Sinn Fein because of its links to past violence. Varadkar said Fine Gael’s stance was unchanged. “I say what I mean and I mean what I say,” he said on Feb. 10. But as the scale of Sinn Fein’s surge became clear, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said, “I’m a democrat.” “I listen to the people. I respect the decision of the people,” he told Irish broadcaster RTE. Talks among the parties are likely to take weeks, though some hope a new government can be formed by St. Patrick’s Day on March 17, when the Irish prime minister traditionally visits the White House. Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald suggested her party could try to form a government with the support of independents and smaller parties such as the Social Democrats and Labour. “We want to talk to anyone who is interested in delivering a program for government, that is about getting to grips with the housing crisis and solving it, getting to grips with the crisis in health and giving families and workers a break and giving a new lease of life to government,” she said. The IRA was responsible for murders, bombings, and other violence for decades during decades of violence known as the “Troubles” in Northern Ireland. More than 3,500 people were killed in conflict between forces that sought to reunify Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland and those who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. Supporters of Sinn Fein point out that it has been more than 20 years since Northern Ireland’s 1998 peace agreement and 15 years since the IRA announced the end of its violent campaign. Sinn Fein already sits in government in Northern Ireland as part of a power-sharing arrangement created by the peace process. Eoin O’Malley, associate professor of political science at Dublin City University, said the party’s past meant little to younger voters without memories of living through the Troubles. He said Sinn Fein had offered the clearest message on social problems in Ireland, which include a growing homelessness crisis, house prices that have risen faster than incomes, and a public health system that hasn’t kept up with demand. “It’s a direct analog to the left-wing populism that you see in Greece and in Spain,” O’Malley said. “In many ways, Sinn Fein are offering relatively simple solutions to pretty complex problems. Mary Lou McDonald said she was going to form ‘a people’s government’ as if all the other governments that have been formed in Ireland had no connection with the ordinary people. It is classic populism.” Fine Gael’s third-place showing likely spells the end of the premiership of Varadkar, who has been Taoiseach, or prime minister, since 2017. Varadkar led Ireland during Britain’s lengthy divorce negotiations with the European Union. The outcome of those talks was crucial to Ireland, the only EU country to share a land border with the UK. Many Irish voters think Varadkar and his party handled Brexit well, securing guarantees that people and goods will continue to flow freely between Ireland and the north. But Brexit featured little in an election campaign dominated by domestic problems. Still, Sinn Fein’s triumph could have implications for Ireland and the UK. The party’s struggle for a united Ireland was on the back burner during the election, but the party is calling for a referendum on reunification within five years. That is not something an Irish government can deliver without the support of Britain and Northern Ireland—highly unlikely in the short term. But Brexit looks likely to nudge Northern Ireland’s economy closer to that of its southern neighbor and could increase pressure for a vote on unification. In London, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, said the UK was “following the results of the Irish election carefully.” He insisted that “the close relationship between the UK and Ireland will continue regardless of the election result.” Share this with everyone!","In a surge that upended Ireland’s traditional two-party system, the left-wing nationalist party beat both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, the centrist parties that have governed Ireland since it won independence from Britain a century ago.

Houstonians were also asked to donate sleeping bags, coolers and solar chargers.

Dann Cuellar has more on Action News at 11 p.m. on January 8, 2020. PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- More than 250,000 people in Puerto Rico are still without water and half a million have no power in the wake of the multiple earthquakes that have terrorized the southwestern part of the island. The magnitude 6.4 quake that struck before dawn on Tuesday killed one person, injured nine others and knocked out power across the U.S. territory, and more than half a million Puerto Ricans remained without electricity early Wednesday. Tuesday's quake was the strongest in a century. There are a number of people in the Delaware Valley who have been actively monitoring developments in Puerto Rico. Some are in fact now planning to go there to offer assistance to rattled residents-- many of whom are sleeping out on the streets for fear their homes could collapse. Amanda Ramirez, from our partners at Univision, was in the town of Ponce on Wednesday. ""There's more than 200 families that live in this community but most of those people are now staying with family members in other places on the island or have gone to the shelter that the government has put in place,"" Ramirez reported.   Activist Nancy Santiago, who now lives in Puerto Rico but has roots in Philadelphia, says after going through a major hurricane and now earthquakes, many on the island are understandably shell shocked. ""Folks are living in a moment of crisis and trauma that feels never-ending. That level of toxic stress on the body not only makes people physically ill, it makes it hard to get your life back,"" she said. ""Puerto Ricans are very resilient and they have learned to normalize what is power outages, living without water, but they really just seem like they can't get a break,"" added Councilwoman Maria Quinones-Sanchez. She says her home on the island was not damaged and her relatives are safe, but she, like Santiago, plan to fly to Puerto Rico Saturday to help with relief efforts. ""And I'm getting calls, 'What do we do next, what do we do next.' And that's why once I get on the ground, I want to talk to our partners and figure out how we contribute to support,"" she said. For those wanting to contribute, she believes Salvation Army Puerto Rico is key for providing food, water and other emergency services. Santiago says there are other non-profits that people can contribute. ""Hispanics in Philanthropy,  which is the organization I represent, has a whole host of non-profit organizations that we vet and work with on a regular basis,"" said Santiago. A delegation of emergency responders from the Salvation Army here will also be leaving for Puerto Rico Thursday to offer their assistance as needed.

      The beefy ex-cop sleeps in a twin-size trundle bed a few inches off the hardwood floor. His wife, their 17-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son rest on the attached full-size bed, and their 16-year-old son turns in on the upper bunk.
   
      Another couple and their 10-year-old son share a queen-size bed in the next room.
   
      Three other families sleep on hulking inflatable mattresses that, when propped up during the day, block out the sunlight in the dining and living rooms. 
   
      This is life these days for more than a dozen of Jodie Roure’s relatives who fled a swarm of earthquakes that have hit Puerto Rico since late December. They cram her two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan’s Hamilton Heights neighborhood, forcing Roure to split them up to manage their stress.  
   
      “The tension buildup was so bad that I had some stay with another family member,” said Roure, 49, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “You have 14 to 16 people in less than 1,000 square feet.”
   
      Since the ground started shaking on December 28 – leaving at least one person dead, causing dozens of buildings to crumble, and cutting power and water to swaths of the island – terrified families have been fleeing Puerto Rico.  
   
      Stunned residents, fearing the worst, have abandoned homes for cars and vans, for mattresses dragged onto sidewalks and sprawling tent-covered encampments.       
   
      For Roure’s relatives, the daily lines outside her lone bathroom aren’t so bad in comparison.
   
      “The other day I told my husband to get me a bucket because I couldn’t wait,” Mirta Santiago Cortés, 67, said with a laugh.
   
      There also are discussions about polarized island politics. Meal preparation and cleanup duties. And agreeing on what to eat each night. 
   
      “We’ve had our arguments,” said Santiago’s daughter, Sharon Quiñones Cortés, 46, who came with her to New York with her own husband and their young son, Sebastian.
   
      It’s not the life they’d chose. But, at least for now, it beats the seismic terror. And they’re not alone. 
   
      It’s too early to quantify the scope of this latest diaspora.
   
      Even before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, an unprecedented migration had begun from the Caribbean island to the mainland United States. It was fueled in part by the US commonwealth’s prolonged financial crisis. Then, tens of thousands more departed after the deadly storm, moving to every US state, from Florida to Alaska. 
    
      Santiago, waiting for a pot of coffee to brew in the small kitchen in Hamilton Heights, came to the mainland this month with 16 relatives, all with one-way tickets on the same flight. She said her sister and husband – whose home in Puerto Rico was destroyed – also left in January to stay with family in Chicago. 
   
      Another relative, Miguel Rodriguez, said eight more family members from the island – including his mother, his daughter and grandchildren – moved from Puerto Rico to his Orlando home two weeks ago. 
   
      “We’re struggling,” he said by phone.
   
      The Rev. Jose Rodriguez, an Episcopal priest in Orlando whose church helped people who fled after Maria, said hundreds of families affected by the earthquakes have arrived in Central Florida. 
   
      “We’re all grasping at straws as to what to do with the earthquake families,” he said. “Obviously, it isn’t as large of a movement as after Hurricane Maria. … But these are hundreds of households who are homeless, who are suffering from PTSD, who have been hit by two traumas – Hurricane Maria and now the earthquakes.”
   
      That trauma is palpable in Roure’s overcrowded Manhattan apartment. 
   
      While Sebastian, 10, said he now feels safe, he worries constantly about the fate of friends who stayed behind. 
   
      “I feel bad for them,” he said. “They can’t travel here. Their families are trying to find where to live.”
   
      Quiñones, his mother, said the boy has insisted on sleeping in the same bed as his parents since the first quake in December. 
   
      She and her husband, Ismael, 51, are both accountants and left their home in Guayanilla, on the southern Puerto Rican coast. Before boarding the flight with Santiago, they’d lived less than a mile from Inmaculada Concepción church, which partially collapsed. Sebastian was preparing for his First Communion in May. 
   
      “He doesn’t know the church collapsed,” Quiñones said. “We thought it would be too much to tell him.”
   
      The town’s Costa Sur Power Plant, which produced more than a quarter of Puerto Rico’s electricity, was severely damaged. Most residents have moved outdoors, especially after a magnitude 6.4 earthquake on January 7, the strongest to hit the island of about 3 million US citizens in more than a century.
   
      “Sebastian would start crying at night. Every night,” his mother recalled. “The biggest quakes came at night. I would hear him praying for his friends. … He would ask God to spare us from the earthquakes each night.”
   
      They only decided to leave Puerto Rico because of Sebastian, said Quiñones and her husband. 
   
      “If we return, we will not go back to Guayanilla,” she said. “He doesn’t want to return to the house.”
   
      The couple said they will live off their savings for now. They have taken leave from their jobs with the local government and will handle tax return preparation for private clients remotely. 
   
      “Our final decision will be based on how our son adapts to school here,” said Ismael Quiñones, whose father, four sisters and 19-year-old daughter from a previous marriage remain in Puerto Rico.   
   
      “We invested so much over the years in our home,” his wife said. “It’s hard to walk away.” 
   
      Alejandro Quiles, 40, a retired police officer from the southern coastal town of Guánica, left the island on that same January 14 flight with his wife – another of Santiago’s daughters – Jeannette, 41, plus their daughter and two sons – Ronalys, 17; Alejandro, 16; and Alexander, 7.
   
      “It’s like the walls were screaming,” Quiles said of the recurring earthquakes.
   
      “You’re constantly thinking about the next one,” his son, Alejandro, said. “Will it be bigger? It’s not something you forget.”
   
      The impact of the uncommon and unpredictable quakes are, for some, worse than the hurricane’s aftermath. 
   
      “You can’t compare this to Maria,” Quiles said. “After the storm ended, you felt safe and knew there would be a recovery. In this case, we don’t know when we’ll have more earthquakes.”
   
      Quiles finally decided to lock up and park the truck from which he sold food at the entrance to the beaches of Guánica in front of his home, which sustained some damage. A house two doors down crumbled to the ground.
   
      “You go to sleep each night thinking about what’s going to happen,” Quiles said. “Where will we go? Should we stay here? It’s stressful not being able to control your life.”
   
      His daughter, Ronalys, is a high school senior. She was applying to colleges – but those plans are now on hold. 
   
      “So many people are not as fortunate as we were,” Quiles said. “We’re safe now, but in every other sense – economically, in terms of stability – we’re in limbo.”
   
      Days after the first earthquake in late December, his mother-in-law, Santiago, simply couldn’t spend another moment in Guánica, the town that took the brunt of the damage from the earthquakes. 
   
      “It was like the walls were coming down,” she said of the persistent aftershocks. 
   
      “I was worried about her state of mind,” said her 37-year-old son, Hernan Cortés Quiles. “I told my sisters, ‘We need to get mom off the island.’ If I didn’t do something, I felt I was going to lose her.”
   
      Santiago and about a dozen other family members first moved to Cortés’ apartment in the southwestern town of San Germán, which was also feeling the quakes.  
   
      “They were crying all the time,” Cortés said of his relatives. “No one wanted to be under a roof. They were sitting outside under the hot sun all the time. They seemed very vulnerable.”
   
      Santiago had told her son she would not leave the island without him and her three daughters. So, Cortés, who works for a health plan, said he charged 14 one-way tickets to New York on a credit card at $180 each. Three others covered their own flight costs.
   
      He completed the purchase, though, before telling family in New York they’d be coming. 
   
      So, Cortés called Roure.
   
      “I said, ‘Mami is not well,’” he recalled, referring to Santiago. “She said yes.”
   
      He drove Santiago home to Guánica to pack her bags. After 10 minutes, she broke down in tears. 
   
      “She said, ‘Get me out of this house.’” he said. “I was surprised. She lived in that house all her life.”
   
      Roure and relatives in New York put money together for expenses. She stocked the refrigerator. She used her connections as an activist for post-Maria medical relief efforts on the island to secure donations of winter clothing.  
   
      “We’ll figure it out because we’re resilient,” she said. “But people need to understand there are thousands of families across the United States in the same situation that no one is noticing. They are US citizens. Many fought in our wars and served our country.”
    
      The island has been rocked in recent years by a string of natural disasters, prolonged power outages, economic stagnation, corruption scandals and peaceful anti-government protests that resulted in Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s resignation in July.
   
      “These events have created a deep sense of insecurity among many residents of the island, which has in turn fueled the outmigration to the US mainland,” said Jorge Duany, a professor of anthropology at Florida International University.
   
      “Unless the Island can recover quickly from its embattled situation, it will maintain a high rate of migration, and the population will likely continue to decline in the near future.”
   
      In the weeks and months after Maria – which claimed thousands of lives – nonprofits and local, state and federal agencies on the mainland mobilized to respond to the influx of hurricane survivors. 
   
      “Since you don’t have people dying now, there is not the same sense of urgency,” said Amílcar Antonio Barreto, a professor at Northeastern University. 
   
      “So, those that decide to move to the US mainland, they’re largely going to be left to their own devices and the beneficence of their own family members.”
   
      Duany added, “The growing demand for bilingual teachers, counselors and other staff is one challenge faced by many local schools. Local governments will likewise feel more pressure in their housing and job markets as a result of the increasing exodus.”
   
      As family members filled out applications for Social Security cards to replace ones they left behind, Roure talked on the phone with a Catholic Charities representative about the help they need.
   
      “Housing is the priority right now,” she said. “They need (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits. Health insurance and mental health. They have PTSD. We have four school-aged children. I have two senior citizens who can use senior support centers. They don’t have all their documents.”
   
      “I’m going to speak to a supervisor, and we’ll put our heads together to see what can be provided,” the representative said.
   
      “They want to work,” Roure continued. “These are all people that work. They’re not here to live off the system. The kids need therapy. They’re traumatized. My aunt is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.”
   
      Barreto, who is Puerto Rican, was in San Juan for a conference earlier this month during some of the temblors. He felt a foreboding among residents that was new. 
   
      “It was almost like an internalized trauma,” he said. “It’s more emotional when people, for example, talk about this relative or that relative who moved to the US mainland or elderly relatives who are like, ‘It used to be great to have all the grandkids around, but they’re all now on the mainland.’ The sense of community and cohesion that folks had has eroded a bit.”
   
      On the day Roure’s relatives arrived from Puerto Rico two weeks ago, she took them to an awards ceremony where she was honored for her medical relief efforts after Maria. They were exhausted and hungry.  
   
      “‘I appreciate this award,’” she remembered telling a crowd of community activists and local elected officials.
   
      “‘But we have the same problem right now. We have a new crisis. I want to recognize my family,’” she recalled saying as her 17 relatives stood up. “’They just arrived from Guánica. What can we do for people like them?’”
   
      “The room,” she said, “was in tears.”

MADISON, New Jersey (WABC) -- As Puerto Rico continues to feel the devastating effects of a series of earthquakes, dogs who were evacuated from the island have arrived in New Jersey to search for fur-ever homes. More than 100 animals from the earthquake-stricken island arrived at Morristown Airport on Sunday and taken to various shelters in the area. The animals were taken from the shelters that were bursting at the seams with homeless animals after the disaster. ""There is probably over half a million stray dogs on the island of Puerto Rico and the shelter system is tremendously overburdened,"" said Eric Larnick with the Sato Project. The Sato Project works with other rescue agencies to bring animals to the States from the island. ""A lot of families have been displaced, they've been without power and lost their homes, and they've been forced to make a really tough decision -- they have to surrender their pets,"" Larnick said. Ten dogs and four cats were taken to St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center where they will soon be available for adoption. ""This is what happens when there are disasters, the interest and the excitement,"" St. Hubert's COO Michelle Thevenin said. ""We see this in all the natural disasters."" Officials thanked The Sato Project and Wings of Rescue for sponsoring the life saving flight. The recent 6.4 magnitude earthquake killed one person and caused more than an estimated $200 million in damage. More than 7,000 people remain in shelters since the quake, and according to The Sato Project, there are as many as 500,000 stray dogs on the island.

1977,Rochesterians worry about loved ones after 6.4-magnitude earthquake strikes Puerto Rico,2020-01-07 15:56 UTC,https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2020/01/07/puerto-rico-earthquake-rochester-ny-residents-worry-about-loved-ones/2831132001/,"Rochester area residents with ties to Puerto Rico — and loved ones on the island — woke to the news of yet-another massive earthquake. A 6.4-magnitude earthquake rumbled across Puerto Rico early Tuesday, killing at least one person and knocking out power to virtually the entire island of more than 3 million. An aftershock three hours later registered 6.0 magnitude. The temblors came one day after the island was shaken by a 5.8 magnitude quake that crumbled homes and triggered states of emergency across the island. More than 300 people have fled their homes and sought refuge. Tuesday's quake was the largest in a series of quakes that have struck the U.S. territory in recent days and caused heavy damage in some areas. Orlando Ortiz of Rochester said his father and grandfather felt the Tuesday temblor and rushed outside their shared home in Cayey, Puerto Rico, which is about 45 minutes south of San Juan. While their property did not sustain any damage from the quake, he said the two men are without power and are seeking out supplies, including batteries. The quakes rocked an island barely recovered from Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017, killing thousands, destroying thousands of homes and knocking out power for weeks. ""I can't imagine being there and reliving this,"" Ortiz said. ""Losing power is reminiscent of what happened after Hurricane Maria. I'd imagine people are better prepared to deal with an outage this time."" Ortiz said his father and grandfather purchased a generator after losing power in 2017, but did not prepare for a natural disaster in other ways. Margarita Gonzalez Martinez of Rochester visits her native Puerto Rico each year and arrived on New Year's Day for a planned 12-week stay. The temblor and its aftershock had her and her husband scrambling Tuesday at their hotel, the Wyndham Grand Río Mar in Río Grande, a municipality in the island's Northern Coastal Valley. Gonzalez Martinez said she was awake and unable to sleep when she ""heard a loud noise and the lights in the hotel went off."" ""The bed was shaking and moving like a hammock,"" she said. ""It was so scary. I started praying and yelling for my husband to get up. We've never experienced anything like this."" Several hours later, everything shook again. The pair remained at the hotel, which has electricity via generators, she said, adding that hotel officials encouraged guests to stay on the property for the time being. ""It's safer here right now,"" she said. ""It will all be OK. We just have to trust God."" Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Gonzalez Martinez left the island as a teenager. She lived for years in Buffalo before moving to Rochester about 25 years ago. She returns to Puerto Rico annually, in part to visit the many friends and relatives who still live there. She has connected with loved ones, who are ""all over the island."" ""Everyone is checking in on each other and are OK,"" she said. Puerto Rican Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced ordered government employees, except for first responders, to stay home. She also urged residents to follow the island's emergency management social media sites for updated information. ""I hope everybody is fine,"" she said on Twitter. ""We urge you to remain calm and safe."" She also said residents should make emergency preparations for more quakes in the next few days. Ponce Mayor Mayita Meléndez said at least one person died and eight were injured Tuesday in the southern coastal city. One man was killed when a wall collapsed at his home.  The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan was operating on generators, but all flights remained on schedule, Aerostar Puerto Rico CEO Jorge Hernández said.  Albert Rodríguez, in the southwest town of Guánica, said the tsunami sirens went off before officials canceled the alert. He said there is widespread damage in his neighborhood. “The road is cracked in the middle and it lifted up,” he said. Monday's quake unleashed small landslides, causing power outages and severely cracking homes. That quake destroyed a popular tourist landmark, Punta Ventana, a coastal rock formation that had formed a sort of rounded window. The Puerto Rico Tourism Co. confirmed that two other sites, Cueva Ventana and Ruinas del Faro, also suffered irreparable damage. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, said it was too early to determine the extent of damage from Tuesday's temblors. “We expect that this will be the largest quake for now,” he said. “The aftershocks will continue for some time.” The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico's southern region began Dec. 28 with a 4.7 magnitude quake followed by a 5.0. The preliminary location Tuesday's earthquake was about 7 miles from Monday's 5.8 earthquake. Over the past several weeks, hundreds of small earthquakes have occurred in this same region.  One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a magnitude 7.3 quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.","Rochester area residents with ties to Puerto Rico — and loved ones on the island — woke to the news of yet-another massive earthquake.

On the wind-whipped hills north of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, Berthenid Dasny holds the keys to the gated memorial erected for Haiti's earthquake victims. Thousands of bodies are buried here in a mass grave dug after a magnitude 7 earthquake shook the country on Jan. 12, 2010. ""They've forgotten about this place; it should look better than this,"" Dasny says as she walks past the overgrown grass, rusted metal statues and brittle brush. For the past year, she has been the memorial's groundskeeper, though she has never been paid. ""You must remember the humans buried here. They were just like us and should always be honored, not forgotten,"" she says. Dasny believes some of her own relatives who were never found after the quake are buried in the grave.

  The earthquake's main shock lasted almost 30 seconds. A series of aftershocks soon followed. An estimated 220,000 died, though Haiti's official estimates are higher. Some 1.5 million people were displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration. About 300,000 were injured, and large parts of the country were buried under tons of twisted metal and concrete.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Donors from around the world swiftly pledged billions of dollars in aid and made promises to rebuild. But a decade on, Haitians who survived say they feel forgotten, as much of the goodwill and billions have been lost to waste, greed and corruption. Elizabonne Casseus, 50, is trying to keep her family afloat. She lives with 17 relatives in a small shelter in Canaan, a slum north of Port-au-Prince inhabited by displaced earthquake survivors. Today, the sprawling array of concrete homes and wooden shacks is home to more than a quarter of a million people. There is no running water; there are no sewers and few roads.

She bought the cover before coming to these windy hills after spending five years in a squalid tent camp near downtown Port-au-Prince. She had hoped the foreign aid would help her repair her home, destroyed in the quake. Haiti has long been the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, and the earthquake only made things worse. In the first year after the quake, the economy contracted by more than 5 %.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Moved by the grisly images of the death and destruction, nations around the world pledged almost $10 billion to Haiti. In addition, $3 billion more was donated to worldwide charities that sent thousands of volunteers to the island. Promises were made for new roads, schools, government buildings and permanent, earthquake-proof housing. Haiti's long-troubled economy was going to be revitalized. While millions poured into Haiti in the first two years after the quake, giving the economy a boost, signs were emerging that reconstruction wouldn't live up to those promises. ""There were so many opportunities after the earthquake that could have reduced so much poverty,"" says Kesner Pharel, a Haitian economist. He calls the last 10 years a ""lost decade."" By 2012, millions of cubic feet of rubble still filled the streets. More than 500,000 people still lived in squalid tent camps, according to the International Organization for Migration.

High-profile groups created to help coordinate the flow of aid money stopped operating. The Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, set up to streamline and provide transparency for major aid projects and co-chaired by former President Bill Clinton, had already disbanded by the fall of 2011, and less than half of the $4.6 billion pledged to projects was spent.

Lindar Celhomme (right) looks through a hole in his plywood house in the Corail-Cesselesse settlement, one of the first places outside of Port-au-Prince where displaced earthquake survivors pitched their tents. A 2013 Government Accountability Office investigation found that USAID had underestimated the cost of infrastructure and housing projects, forcing it to substantially reduce the number of homes it originally planned to help build. The GAO also found that most USAID contracts went to non-Haitian companies, leaving local businesses out of any reconstruction boon. And an NPR investigation five years after the quake found that the American Red Cross, which took in half a billion dollars from U.S. donors, had only built six permanent homes, not the 132,000 it had claimed. The Red Cross disputed NPR's reports and objected to findings of opaque bookkeeping and exorbitant overhead costs. Economist Pharel says that on top of the botched reconstruction effort, Haiti's constant political turmoil, weak institutions and poor governance squandered international funds and goodwill. The United Nations has struggled in recent years to get donors to fulfill their aid commitments. Last year, it only met 30% of its funding goals to Haiti, according to the U.N.

 Empty jugs for water sit in a corner of Berthenid Dasny's home. Outside her door sits a large pile of stone and sand that she has been gradually purchasing in hopes of someday building a new home. In recent months, though, citizens have been demanding more accountability from their leaders, not only for the earthquake aid but also for billions of dollars provided to Haiti from an aid program sponsored by Venezuela, known as PetroCaribe. Opponents of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse accuse him of embezzling some of the PetroCaribe funds, and they've taken to the streets demanding he resign. Moïse denies all allegations. This fall, demonstrations turned violent, leaving 50 people dead and more than 100 injured. Schools and businesses were shut down for weeks. Critical food aid, especially outside the capital, couldn't reach much of the population as demonstrators blocked highways and roads. About a million Haitians suffer severe hunger. Human rights advocates say gangs have grown in the midst of the political turmoil. 
                Medical professionals and other protesters demand the resignation of President Jovenel Moïse in Port-au-Prince in October. Moïse has been accused of embezzling aid money.

 Medical professionals and other protesters demand the resignation of President Jovenel Moïse in Port-au-Prince in October. Moïse has been accused of embezzling aid money. But many Haitians are no longer waiting for government or aid groups to build them more permanent homes. Casseus, who relocated to the sprawling slum outside Port-au-Prince, buys sand and stone whenever she has a little extra money so that one day, she can build a more permanent structure on the land she bought. She admits it is slow going for her and her husband, a car mechanic. ""Sometimes he goes out all day long and comes back with no money,"" she says. Dasny, the earthquake memorial's groundskeeper, also hopes for a better place to live. For now, she has cobbled together a two-room house on the dusty hillside where she lives by the mass grave. It is made of wooden slats and corrugated tin that rattles and roars with every gust of wind.

Please enter a search term.     (CNN) — A tsunami threat message has been issued by the U.S. National Weather Service’s Pacific Tsunami Warning Center after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Tuesday near Jamaica. The weather service said there is a threat of tsunami waves reaching 0.3 to 1 meter (about 1 to 3 feet) above tide level for the coasts of Jamaica, Belize, Cuba, Honduras, Mexico and the Cayman Islands. The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake had a preliminary depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). The quake hit 125 kilometers (77.6 miles) north-northwest of Lucea in Jamaica. There are no initial reports of damage or casualties.

2069,"Magnitude 7.7 earthquake strikes between Jamaica and Cuba, one of strongest on record in Caribbean",2020-01-28 21:02 UTC,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/01/28/earthquake-jamaica-cuba/,"This article was published more than 3 years ago One of the strongest earthquakes on record in the Caribbean, 7.7 magnitude, struck about 70 miles northwest of Montego Bay, Jamaica, shortly after 2 p.m. Tuesday. Minor shaking was felt as far north as Florida, while more moderate shaking was reported in Jamaica. Shaking was also reported in the Cayman Islands, Cuba. and Mexico. Initial reports of damage from the region have been spotty. In South Florida, where shaking was felt when the earthquake struck, multiple buildings were evacuated in Miami.  The originating earthquake appeared to be one of the biggest on record in the Caribbean, and the largest since 1946, with only a few additional high-end earthquakes appearing in the U.S. Geological Survey database. 7.0+ quakes in and around the Caribbean per USGS. For those in the Caribbean, the two in light blue were 7.7 like the prelim from today's in red.  #earthquake #jamaica #cuba pic.twitter.com/LaPB4N4xgE The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that a small tsunami was possible in parts of the Caribbean and surrounding areas, with  waves of up to three feet. However, just before 4 p.m., it posted that the tsunami threat had passed. Tide gauges indicated that any tsunami waves generated by the earthquake were small. Relatively small #tsunami wave arrival on tide gauge in Cayman Islands. Very fortunate for tsunami hazard that this is a strike-slip earthquake. pic.twitter.com/7LLoS12EBd A larger tsunami did not result as the earthquake was largely caused by a strike-slip mechanism with some obliquity. That means one tectonic plate probably slipped past another horizontally and downward. The M7.7 Jamaican quake produced sideways motion on the fault, so the tsunami risk is low. (Seafloor should move up to make tsunami.) But if I'm ever at the beach and feel strong shaking, I move to high ground. Downside is I lose a day at the beach. The upside could be my life. Converging plates, on the other hand, are usually the most effective at generating tsunamis. The magnitude of a tsunami is proportional to the area and magnitude of the slip. A look at background seismicity shows no recent foreshocks associated with this quake. Initially, it appears the quake occurred along the southern periphery of the North American plate, which is inching westward. At the same time, the Caribbean plate is moving northeast at several centimeters per year. Between them lies the Gonâve microplate. The earthquake occurred near the Cayman Trough. The energy release was equivalent to tens of billions of tons of explosives. The quake was exceptionally shallow, occurring at only a few miles’ depth. Because of its distance offshore, impacts may be minimized. Smaller aftershocks are likely in the region in the coming weeks. There are only 4-5 #earthquakes this strong on 🌎 every year #Jamaica #Cuba pic.twitter.com/sc0U2B14gr A “record section” produced by data from the Global Seismic Network, presented above, shows earthquake waves spreading out and traveling around the world. Each vertical trace represents an individual seismograph. When compiled together, they illustrate the waves propagating around the globe — detected by seismometers even if humans can’t feel them. (Time is measured from bottom to top.) Two distinct clusterings of waves can be seen in the plot. The first are body waves, which occur lower in each trace because they are the earliest waves to arrive following a quake. Body waves move through the earth. First are the P (compressional) waves, then the S (shear) waves — about 40 percent slower when traveling through solid rock. Surface waves are considerably slower, but they cause most damage. Surface waves are made up of Love waves, which result in a back-and-forth shaking, and Rayleigh waves, which cause a rolling motion. Surface waves are slower because they propagate along the earth’s surface. Ever heard folklore about animals “sensing” an earthquake before it arrives? That’s not myth. Some animals can sense the passage of ultra-subtle body waves (which we rarely feel) and take action, sometimes tens of minutes before the damaging surface waves arrive.

""Los Angeles leads the nation in earthquake resilience, and ShakeAlertLA showed how we can harness technology to provide critical warning before an earthquake hits,'' Garcetti said in a statement. ""The next `big one' is not a matter of if, but when, and we can all do our part to stay prepared, resilient and a few seconds ahead of the game by downloading the MyShake app now.'' Gov. Gavin Newsom announced MyShake on Oct. 17, 2019, and since its release it has been downloaded more than 1 million times, according to the mayor's office. ""Through working cooperatively with the U.S. Geological Survey, the city of Los Angeles delivered the country's first cell phone app for mass delivery of earthquake early warning alerts,"" U.S. Geological Survey Director Jim Reilly said. ""What we learned from our important pilot partnership with the city of L.A. has benefited people throughout the West Coast as we expand ShakeAlert.'' The MyShake system works the same way as ShakeAlertLA and detects earthquakes through ground-motion censors. If an earthquake with a significantmagnitude is detected, an alert message is issued, warning the public several seconds before shaking begins. ShakeAlertLA issued 100,000 early warning alerts of all recordable earthquake activity since its launch in 2018, according to the mayor's office.  ""On behalf of the governor and state of California, we thank Mayor Garcetti for his leadership and work to advance seismic safety,'' said Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services. ""We are better positioned today because of the mayor's efforts and encourage all Angelenos to access the statewide earthquake early warning system, which can provide life-saving seconds to drop, cover and hold on before an earthquake. We are pleased to be able to expand this life-saving technology to all Californians.'' ShakeAlertLA was meant to ""serve as a bridge'' to a statewide earthquake early warning system, according to the mayor's office, and city officials worked with other governments to assist them in developing earthquake early warning programs. Now that a statewide system is in place, the ShakeAlertLA app will stop sending alerts at the start of 2021. The MyShake app is available for download through the Apple Store or Google Play.

Miller's then-girlfriend said she was prepared. ""She said, 'Here let me show you,'"" Miller recounted. ""She goes to the closet and there's two bottles of water, one of them is leaking, a can of food and she doesn't have a can opener and a first aid kit that's been picked through. She was like, 'You know what? I'm not prepared either.'"" For Miller and Hallgren, that moment was a realization that they were not prepared to deal with crisis, and neither were most people. It was the foundation for the duo's bootstrapped start-up Redfora, makers of ""Earthquake Bag"" emergency kits. ""That really opened up our eyes,"" Miller said. ""We could not only help other people get prepared, but there's a business opportunity there as well."" The two put together earthquake-preparation kits for themselves and their friends, and as an experiment, they also decided to buy enough supplies to build extra kits they could sell. Hallgren and Miller targeted the kits to Facebook users in San Francisco, and within a few weeks, the pair sold 50 of them that they personally drove and dropped off to their customers. ""They knew they needed to do something, but they knew they were never going to do it themselves,"" Miller said. What started as a side project has grown into a full business. Hallgren and Miller worked on Redfora on nights and weekends from 2015 through 2017, but by early 2018, the company was generating enough revenue that both of them quit their day jobs. Redfora claims it has driven eight figures of revenue and been profitable since its launch. Whether it's a natural disaster like hurricanes in the Gulf Coast, geopolitical tensions like international disputes involving President Donald Trump and countries like Iran and North Korea, or the constant flood of climate change news, customers are often motivated to buy the Earthquake Bag by headlines, Hallgren and Miller said. ""That's a big opportunity,"" Hallgren said. ""Unfortunately, it's on the right side of a dangerous trend."" The COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, for example, has been a boon for Redfora. The company has seen an increase in its sale of emergency kits, especially its recently launched ""N95 Mask Protection Kit,"" in correlation with the outbreak. ""We have sold thousands of these kits over the past month, and we were forced to set a hard limit of 10 kits per customer to prevent hoarding,"" Miller said. Redfora's flagship product is the Complete Earthquake Bag. The company sells it on Amazon and its own website starting at $114.99 with enough supplies for one person to last three days. This distinctly red bag includes water, food, a sleeping bag and tools like a hand crank radio and work gloves, among other items. The products can be further customized if bought on the company's website. There, customers can change how many people their bag supports, for how many days and for how long they want the supplies to last. Redfora's most expensive kit, the ""20 Year Earthquake Bag"" designed for six people for seven days, costs $741.99. Customers can also buy specialized kits like those designed for the car, the office or pets, which can be customized for dogs or cats. ""The biggest challenge is how do you get someone to go from 'this is too scary to think about,' or 'if there's a disaster, I'm going to die anyway, so why plan for it?' -- how do we get them to go from zero to the lowest-hanging fruit?"" Miller said. Redfora isn't the first company to specialize in emergency preparedness, but it has applied modern marketing tactics to an industry that has typically been spearheaded by mom and pop shops. To do this, the company has made a point to produce educational emergency preparedness content that prospective customers can find online. This includes the company's blog, which now has a million readers, and the Redfora ""Ultimate 47 Item Earthquake Checklist"" that people can use to make their own kits. ""Even if you don't spend a dollar with us, having another person who is prepared is someone else who might encourage one of their friends to get prepared,"" Miller said. More importantly, Hallgren and Miller rely on Facebook, Google and Amazon to target ads to folks who are thinking about getting prepared for emergencies. Although the traditional buyers of doomsday gear have been men in rural areas who tend to buy when Democrats get elected, Redfora has found a drastically different audience. The company says its customer base tends to skew toward liberal women in their 40s. ""It's the matriarchs of families,"" Hallgren said. ""Men who have traditionally been interested in emergency preparedness think that they can Rambo their way through a disaster. Females tend to plan ahead."" That was the case with Katie McDonagh, 27, a tech worker who lives in Oakland. In the summer of 2018, she was feeling uncertain and worried about her family as she read the news. She'd previously heard about the Earthquake Bag, and she decided that at the very least she could buy her parents a kit. ""Our world is unpredictable right now,"" McDonagh said. ""I had this vision that the worst could happen, and giving myself peace of mind that my family would be able to take care of themselves in the event of a disaster was reassuring to me.""

2176,Earthquake risk prompts order to drain Calif. dam,2020-02-25 21:28 UTC,https://fox5sandiego.com/news/earthquakes/earthquake-risk-prompts-order-to-drain-calif-dam/,"FOX 5 San Diego Please enter a search term. Please enter a search term.       SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Worried that an earthquake could collapse a big dam south of San Francisco, officials have ordered its reservoir to be completely drained by October to reduce the risk of floodwaters spilling into Silicon Valley. The 240-foot (73-meter) high earthen Anderson Dam, built in 1950 between San Jose and the community of Morgan Hill, poses too great a risk of collapse and must be fully drained by Oct. 1, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates dams, the Mercury News reported. “It is unacceptable to maintain the reservoir at an elevation higher than necessary when it can be reduced, thereby decreasing the risk to public safety and the large population downstream,” David Capka, director of the commission’s Division of Dam Safety and Inspections, wrote last week in a letter to the Santa Clara Valley Water District. Since 2009, the dam’s water level has been kept at a maximum of 74 percent of capacity because of an assessment that it could fail in a 7.2 quake. The reservoir is built along the Calaveras Fault. On Monday, amid the threat of another drought in California, Anderson Reservoir was just 29% full.  A seismic retrofit project has been underway because of its state classification in 2017 as being an “extremely high” downstream hazard. The Santa Clara Valley Water District said in a statement Monday that officials agree with the commission’s assessment that the reservoir should be drained ahead of the retrofit project, which is “complicated and time consuming.” “Valley Water has been working with several state and federal agencies through the years to secure the proper permits as the scope of the project has increased due to additional safety and design requirements,” Valley Water CEO Norma Camacho said. “A priority will be to design and build a large outlet pipe, which will provide greater control over the water levels and increase public safety,” she added in the statement.  Camacho said draining the largest reservoir in the district will likely kill wildlife downstream in Coyote Creek, including endangered steelhead trout, amphibians and reptiles. Coyote Creek flows from the dam through downtown San Jose to San Francisco Bay. If the dam collapsed, runoff could damage cities and rural areas from the San Francisco Bay through Monterey Bay to the south, including much of Silicon Valley, the water district said in a statement. More than 14,000 residents had to be evacuated in 2017 as water from swollen Coyote Creek, downstream of the Anderson Reservoir, flooded homes and temporarily shut down a portion of a freeway.  It came the same month as a spillway failed at the nation’s tallest dam, in Oroville in Northern California, leading officials to order the evacuation of nearly 200,000 people. The dam ultimately held, but an independent investigation cited “a long-term systemic failure ” by regulators and the dam industry to recognize and address warning signs. California spent $1.1 billion repairing the Lake Oroville spillway, enacted new emergency plan requirements and launched a review of 93 other dams with similar spillways. An AP investigation last year identified at least 1,688 high-hazard dams rated in poor or unsatisfactory condition in 44 states and Puerto Rico.  Complicating the issue this year, California may be heading into a new drought.  Stored water is an important part of the south San Francisco Bay Area’s supply — with enough water for the annual needs of at least 130,000 people as well as what the district considers an emergency supply. “While residents have done an excellent job of conserving water since 2013, another drought during this time frame could require everyone to significantly decrease their water use,” Camacho said. The agency is exploring other sources of water from outside Santa Clara County, she said.

Please enter a search term.     LOUISA COUNTY, Va. (WFXR) – A small earthquake woke up some people in Louisa County this morning. The earthquake measured at a magnitude 2.7 at a depth of 2.5 miles.  So far there are no reports of injuries or damages. The earthquake struck close to where a magnitude 5.8 rocked Virginia and the East Coast back in 2011. That tremor was felt at an intensity of VII (Very Strong) on the Mercalli Scale. Several buildings were damaged in that quake and some people sustained minor injuries. The 2011 earthquake was felt in Washington D.C. and government buildings had to be evacuated. A later survey revealed there were cracks near the top of the Washington Monument, which was closed for repairs until 2014. Today’s earthquake did not see as big of a reach as the 2011 earthquake. Most likely, people in our area did not feel the quake. However, it was picked up on seismometers at the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg.  Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Seismograph with paper in action and earthquake – 3D Rendering    Seismograph with paper in action and earthquake – 3D Rendering    A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Tuesday about 80 miles from Jamaica, shaking people in the Caribbean and as far away as Miami. A tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica, or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. A tsunami threat alert was lifted Tuesday afternoon, a few hours after the quake. Alec Pultr, who lives in Ogier, Grand Cayman, said it wasn’t the first earthquake he’s experienced but it was the biggest “by far.” “We were simply working and things started to sway,” he told CNN. As the swaying and shaking became more violent, most people started to run; the ones who stayed behind got under their desks. People in Miami, 440 miles from the epicenter, felt shaking. Miguel Charon was on the 13th floor of a building on Brickell Avenue. He told CNN he felt the walls shake for 30 to 40 seconds. His initial thought was that it must have been caused by a machine of some sort. He said building officials issued an evacuation order and people left the building in a smooth and calm manner. Jose Borrego, who also works in the Brickell area, said he was in a meeting. “We felt slight movement of the building, then we got told to evacuate the building,” he said. “Once we came outside (we) noticed that there are evacuations every building in the area.” The earthquake appears to have been a “strike-slip earthquake,” in which tectonic plates slide against each other. This limits the threat of a devastating tsunami, which are more associated with “thrust earthquakes,” where a portion of the earth is thrust upward and causes the water to push up and outward, creating the tsunami. The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake had a preliminary depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). The quake hit 125 kilometers (77.6 miles) north-northwest of Lucea in Jamaica. The earthquake also was felt as far away as Havana. Some people in the Cuban capital were evacuating taller buildings. Cuba’s state media reported the earthquake was felt across the island in Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, Holguín, Las Tunas, Cienfuegos, Pinar del Río, Havana and the Isle of Youth. There are no initial reports of damage or casualties.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com ANKARA, Turkey – The death toll from a strong earthquake that rocked eastern Turkey climbed to 22 Saturday, with more than 1,000 people injured, officials said. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, speaking at a televised news conference near the epicenter of the quake, said 39 people had been rescued from the rubble of collapsed buildings, including a woman recovered 14 hours after the main tremor. Rescue workers were continuing to search for people buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings in Elazig province and neighboring Malatya, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said earlier. IRAN HIT WITH MAGNITUDE 4.9 EARTHQUAKE NEAR NUCLEAR PLANT Emergency workers and security forces distributed tents, beds and blankets as overnight temperatures dropped below freezing in the affected areas. Mosques, schools, sports halls and student dormitories were opened for hundreds who left their homes after the quake. Rescue workers try to reach people under a collapsed building following a strong earthquake in Elazig in the eastern Turkey, Saturday, Jan. 25, 2020. The earthquake rocked eastern Turkey on Friday, causing some buildings to collapse and killing scores of people, Turkish officials said. (IHA via AP)  “The earthquake was very severe, we desperately ran out (of our home),” Emre Gocer told the state-run Anadolu news agency as he sheltered with his family at a sports hall in the town of Sivrice in Elazig. “We don’t have a safe place to stay right now.”  AFAD said it was followed by 228 aftershocks, the strongest with magnitudes 5.4 and 5.1. At least five buildings in Sivrice and 25 in Malatya province were destroyed, said Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum. Hundreds of other structures were damaged and made unsafe. Soylu said 18 people were killed in Elazig and four in Malatya. Some 1,030 people were hurt. Speaking at the same news conference, Koca said 34 people remain in intensive care. Television footage showed emergency workers removing two people from the wreckage of a collapsed building in the town of Gezin. Another person was saved in the city of Elazig, the provincial capital, and two more from a house in Doganyol, Malatya. PUERTO RICO SHOCKED BY MAGNITUDE 5.9 EARTHQUAKE CAUSING FURTHER DAMAGE TO ISLAND A prison in Adiyaman, 110 kilometers (70 miles) southwest of the epicenter, was evacuated after being damaged in the quake.

Please enter a search term.     PUERTO RICO (CNN) — An earthquake with a 5.9 magnitude rattled Puerto Rico on Saturday morning, the US Geological Survey reports.  The quake was about 8 miles south of Indios in the Caribbean Sea, the USGS said, at a depth of 6.2 miles. The USGS first said the preliminary magnitude was 6.0. Puerto Rico has been beset by temblors throughout the week, including a 6.4 magnitude quake Tuesday that killed at least one man, destroyed homes and left most of the island without power. A 5.2 magnitude aftershock struck on Friday afternoon. The US territory was expecting power to return by Saturday to its 3 million residents, and authorities had tweeted that it was 95% restored a couple of hours before Saturday’s quake at about 8 a.m. ET. Parts of Lares, Adjuntas, Ponce and San German lost electrical service after the new quake, the power company Electric Energy Authority said. After the tremor, power was on to about 93% of the island, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority said. The earthquake renewed fear and anxiety among residents in the southern towns of the island. In Ponce, parts of the roof and facade of a historic building collapsed. Luis Emanuelli, who owns a restaurant in the building, said that while the interior was not damaged, he and his team decided pick up a few documents, some equipment and close indefinitely. “We don’t know what we are exposed to,” he said.  That storm killed almost 3,000 people, and left millions of Americans without power, water or shelter. Recovery has been slow and hard. Amid the earthquakes, Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced this week declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard. She told people to stay calm and expect aftershocks. Many took mattresses, tents and tarps into their yards to sleep, afraid of what aftershocks could do to their homes, already stressed or damaged. More than 6,000 people were staying in shelters, Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, the territory’s nonvoting delegate to Congress, said Friday.  “Relief workers, neighbors who’ve had to evacuate, and others impacted by the event” are eligible to book rooms at no cost, Airbnb says. “If you’ve been displaced or are helping with relief efforts, you can book free accommodations between January 9, 2020 and January 31, 2020.” Residents can also donate space for those in need of temporary housing.

The 700-mile (1,127 kilometer) boundary, a fault known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, runs from Northern California to Canada. Scientists say the Juan de Fuca plate is trying to force its way under the North American plate. Last year, an earthquake danger assessment by the U. S.

According to the United States Geological Survey, the earthquake was recorded at a depth of 3.1 miles. No word on any damage but that’s the second earthquake within a month in that area. The other one was on Dec. 17, just 53 miles south of Carlsbad with a magnitude of 2.7. Earthquakes are caused by a sudden slip on a fault. The tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth’s crust and cause the shaking that we feel.
